Revenue‑generation opportunities:

1)  1 MW ARMS 200 pods with 256 GPUs

         Each ARMS 200 module is self‑contained: it provides 1 MW of critical power, is equipped to host up to 256 NVIDIA B200/B300 GPUs and uses liquid cooling with dual‑path power redundancy .  Because the pods are Tier‑III certified and designed for rapid deployment , they can be brought online far faster than traditional data‑centres.  High‑density GPU pods can command premium rental rates because tenants pay for compute rather than just space and power.",2025-11-12T07:57:34Z,2025-11-12T07:57:34+00:00,0.11297435313463211,0.009091743268072605,0.8779339790344238,neutral,0.8779339790344238,0.1038826098665595
