2,GOOG,"Waymo by $GOOG , has revealed plans to launch its fully driverless robotaxi service in three additional U.S. cities starting in 2026: San Diego, Detroit, and Las Vegas.

The announcement expands its current operations, which are limited to San Francisco, Phoenix, and Los Angeles, where Waymo already handles more than 50,000 weekly rides with electric Jaguar I-PACE vehicles equipped with LIDAR, radar, and camera sensors.

The rollout will begin with mapping and testing phases, followed by public access through the Waymo One app. The company highlights improved safety—data suggests fewer accidents—along with better accessibility for seniors and people with disabilities, and environmental sustainability thanks to its electric fleet.

Waymo has not provided specific launch dates or pricing yet, but it’s encouraging users to join the waitlist. This expansion strengthens Waymo’s leadership in the autonomous vehicle space, competing with Cruise and $TSLA .
