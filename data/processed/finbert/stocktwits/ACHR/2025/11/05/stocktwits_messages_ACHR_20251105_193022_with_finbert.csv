Many current platforms, including traditional helicopters, face limitations in icing conditions, where critical systems like rotors and exposed components are vulnerable to ice buildup. 
 
Our Cavorite X7 tackles this challenge head-on. Its closing wing design keeps vital systems protected from the elements and simplifies de-icing, reducing downtime and improving operational safety.
