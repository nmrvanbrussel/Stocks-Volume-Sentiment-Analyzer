As year-end approaches, fund managers must present their performance to LPs. To make their year-end reports look impressive, they tend to buy the year's best-performing stocks and sell underperforming ones.

1,VRT,"Advice on investing strategy, multiple ETFs to add diversification for riskier stock portfolio?","Hey folks, 

Relatively new investor here, just started earlier this year with an inheritance fund, looking for advice on this strategy and balancing risk with security. I have a pretty high risk tolerance for \~50% of my port in stocks for short to medium term gains and \~50% in long term 20+ year ETFs as retirement fund. 

Profile: 33M, single no kids, western Europe, low mortgage, low expenses, have a 3 month safety net, monthly savings and aiming to invest 300 - 500 per month with the following portfolio goal (note: my current portfolio is a mess with many individual stocks I bought a small amount of when starting out as experimentation, so I plan to sell off all the noise and increase my safety net in long term ETFs. My current portfolio (\~30k) looks something like this: 

ETFs:  
\- 30% Amundi Prime All-World (WEBN)  
\- 10% Amundi STOXX Europe 600 Acc (LYP6)  
\- 5% WisdomTree Europe Defence (EUDF) 

Stocks:  
\- 30% - across 10 medium term high conviction Tech/AI: GOOGL, MSFT, NVDA, META, AMD, AVGO, NBIS, SOFI, ASML  
\- 20% - across 20 or so short-medium term low conviction Tech &amp; Other stocks (I won´t list them but everything from AMZ, VRT, IREN, TSMC, MU, BABA, RKLB, ASTS and some utilities, raw materials etc, generally speculative plays.    
\- 5% - I consider noise, learning experiences, minor investments of 5 - 50 eur which I´ll gradually close.   


Before you all jump down my throat, I know I am overstretched and overcomplicated. Given my risk profile, I am happy to keep 30 - 40% of portfolio within the growth/tech sector as that´s my main area of interest and I don´t believe my Top 10 above are going anywhere in the next 5 years regardless of AI bubble. I am also happy to keep 10% in relatively speculative plays but will try to reduce that list to 10 companies or so. For this group I plan to trim regularly to fund the ETFs on top of regular monthly investments. 

Eventually, as I get older and want more security, I will aim for 60-70% ETFs, maybe some other assets like gold/real estate/bonds etc, so my main question now is on the ETFs above and your thoughts on adding another or if this would be redundant. I´m considering adding something like FTSE All-World High Dividend Yield Acc (VHYG) or an Emerging Markets/ex-US fund. I´m thinking these may offer broader exposure in the case of downturns, sector rotations, crashes. I´m attracted to high dividend ETF as they may be more stable, defensive, consumer/utility companies but I don´t care for the payout of dividends just the exposure to broader sectors and regions. I´m naturally avoiding anything that´s high-tech or high-US given the above allocation. 

Can you give me your thoughts on this? Does an All world Dividend Accumulating ETF make sense or am I just overcomplicating it more? Should I stick to WEBN, LYP6 or any better alternatives?   
I expect many of you will say to invest in a Tech sector ETF but I quite enjoy the picking and following and researching of the companies, and want to allocate accordingly e.g. I do not want to invest in PLTR, APPL, TSLA for reasons.

2,VRT,Hnrg is the next big play,"### 🚨 HNRG: The Most Undervalued Data-Center Power Play in America Right Now 🚨

While everyone is chasing the usual suspects (SMCI, VRT, DELL, IREN, CORZ) at 50–100x sales, there’s a tiny $350M market-cap company quietly positioned to become **the backbone of Indiana’s AI/data-center explosion** — and it’s still trading under $9.

**Hallador Energy (HNRG)** owns the 890 MW Merom coal-fired power plant in Sullivan County, Indiana — one of the few large, dispatchable, already-permitted power stations sitting in the heart of the Midwest data-center gold rush.

Here’s why HNRG could legitimately turn patient investors into millionaires over the next 3–5 years:

1. **Indiana is the new Ohio/Virginia for hyperscalers**  
   - 30+ hyperscale campuses under construction right now  
   - Amazon’s $11B New Carlisle campus, Google Fort Wayne, Meta Jeffersonville/Lebanon, Microsoft La Porte… the list keeps growing  
   - Combined demand projected to exceed **10 GW by 2030** — more power than the entire state of Indiana uses for residential today

2. **Merom is perfectly located &amp; already permitted**  
   - Sits on the Indiana-MISO grid where the new load is exploding  
   - Has existing 765 kV transmission lines — something new builds will wait 5–10 years for  
   - Fully permitted for coal → gas → nuclear conversion pathways

3. **The company is pivoting FAST**  
   - Q3 revenue +40% YoY, swung to $0.56 EPS profit  
   - Already signed LOIs to add **525 MW of new gas-fired generation** at Merom specifically targeted at data-center customers  
   - Management openly states they are in “multiple active discussions” with hyperscalers and co-developers for the remaining ~600 acres and power capacity

4. **Insanely cheap valuation**  
   - Current market cap ≈ $350M  
   - Forward 2026–2027 EBITDA guidance (just from existing coal + new gas) already points to **$150–200M+**  
   - That’s &lt;2.5x EBITDA while pure-play power providers to data centers trade 15–40x  
   - Plus they own 9+ million tons of coal reserves and Sunrise Coal — basically free optionality

5. **The millionaire math is stupidly simple**  
   If HNRG simply gets valued like the average data-center power provider (20x EBITDA) on just the **existing** Merom expansion plans → $3–4B market cap = **10x–12x from today**.  
   Add in potential nuclear SMR co-development or a full take-private by a hyperscaler and you’re looking at 20–50x territory.

Short float is still ~8.5% and dropping. Institutions have barely touched it. Most retail still thinks “coal = dead.”  
Meanwhile the same people paying 80x sales for air-cooling companies are missing the actual bottleneck: **electrons**.

$HNRG is the classic “hidden gem” setup:  
- Tiny float  
- Explosive secular tailwind (AI power shortage)  
- Catalyst-rich next 12–24 months (new PPAs, gas plant FID, potential nuclear announcements)  
- Trading at depression-level multiples

I’m not saying it happens tomorrow. But the same way $MRO and $APA made oil &amp; gas millionaires in 2021–2022, the next wave of AI infrastructure millionaires will come from the companies that actually deliver the megawatts.

Do your own DD, but HNRG screens as one of the highest asymmetric bets in the entire data-center food chain right now.

Who else is loading the truck under $9 while nobody’s watching? 👀

i work in industrial hvac in the dmv and have often found myself installing the vertiv systems in data centers. in this climate there's no need to use cooling towers which consume water, we use air chillers which work the same way a window AC does without using evaporation, so there's no controversy in my area about data center water use, which is a major blemish on ai in the minds of the average person. there are many people concerned about electrical grids being overloaded but no one worries about the water. i wondered to myself today why data centers out west use cooling towers instead of geothermal heat pumps, which consume no water after initial fill and offer significant energy savings over time, maybe a 5 year period of the equipment paying for itself.  

if anyone thought that these data centers were going to be profitable after 2030 they would be building them in a much different way. geothermal heat pumps do not take considerably longer to install so time to market is not a major factor.

4,VRT,I'm bad at handling winners; when to add more or take profit,"Just looking for some insight as what to do when a stock is doing really well. I'm here kicking myself because I could have handled it better, and what to do if I get this kind of scenario again.

A while ago, I bought a tech stock (VRT) at $20 a piece. I did do research on the company before buying and I liked them, plus it rounded out my small portfolio. I don't have a lot of money to invest, but I'm trying, so I only bought 7 shares. It doubled, so I sold 2. Fast forward a few months and it had doubled again, so I sold 2 more. Reinvested that into an ETF for the long term which is also doing pretty good. But that only resulted in a couple hundred bucks. Decided to hang on to the remaining 3 because it was doing well and waited to see what it would do. 

Even within the last few months, it seemed to have settled around $120 and then \[news happened\] and it pumped an extra $50 a share over the course of about 2 weeks, where I hadn't been checking my account. So now the 3 shares I still own are something like 730% value. I realized that I don't know if I should keep them, sell them, or add more because this company keeps doing great, but I also realize part of that in this specific case is the AI boom which could continue for years or blow up tomorrow if Grok turns into Mecha-hitler again. I can't really afford whole shares at $150+ either. 

 I think I have probably missed out on 2-3 big run ups by playing it too safe / not being aggressive enough, but then a few of the stocks where I go ""this is it, buy more!"" turn red the next week. Is there a method for this kind of decision or is it just instincts and deep diving the companies to understand everything about them? I would have made a really good play if there were three 0's on the end of both values, but I can't throw those kind of numbers around. As a very novice investor who works for a living, what can I do to determine when to add more to a stock with momentum compared to when I should pull profit because it is up 200%? 

tl;dr - Picked a stock, it did really well, but could have made actual money if I had put in more at the start, looking for advice on when to add more or when to take profit and high-five myself for a good percentage gain.

Option 1: Companies that dont make it crash badly on Monday. Investors were excited for it to happen. So buy next Friday $500 PUT spread for all of them (spread helps with IV crush and theta decay over weekend). Buy shares of the chosen one after its announced as institutional buying will push it higher for Mon, Tue, Wed.

Option 2: Do synthetic straddle, buy 100 shares and one PUT. If stock is not selected after hours, sell immediately. Close the PUT on Monday for some possible profit.

I think I will do option 2 on APP HOOD. Both are showing elevated IVs. So there should have been lot of buying.

They make the thermal management and power infrastructure for data centers. Basically the stuff that keeps all the AI servers from overheating or shutting down.

Their backlog is over $6 billion, revenue is up 26% YoY, and their margins are expanding. They’re also rolling out direct-to-chip liquid cooling, which seems like it’s going to become standard for high-density AI racks (like the ones running Nvidia H100s and beyond).

They’re not flashy like Nvidia or AMD, but they seem to be in the right spot of the supply chain.

Stock’s had a solid run already but still trades under 30× forward earnings, which feels reasonable given the growth and tailwinds. I see some big funds starting to accumulate too.

4,VRT,AI trade simply out of juice or starting to deflate?,"The S&amp;P 500 has had a stellar run for the past couple of years, adding roughly $19T from the ChatGPT moment (Nov '22) to the DeepSeek event (Jan '25). I ran some back of the envelope calculations and, by my estimate, at least half of that is AI-driven!

By AI-driven, I’m referring to two key contributors:

1. First, the ""picks and shovels"" plays in AI data centers, which contributed $4.5 trillion (24% of the S&amp;P's gains), with NVDA leading the charge, accounting for 69% (nice) of this group's gains. While in my table I’ve focused on some of the major players in this space, it's likely I've left out many others, meaning these figures almost certainly underestimate the full impact.
2. Second, the rest of the Magnificent 7, which have benefited in various ways from the AI narrative, added an additional $5.2 trillion (27% of the S&amp;P's gains).

Now, the big question is: Is the AI trade simply losing some juice, or are we witnessing the start of a full-blown reversal? Since the DeepSeek event, these names have collectively shed $1.3 trillion, suggesting the latter might not be easily dismissed.

What does this mean for the S&amp;P going forward? The rest of the pack will have to pick up the slack if we are to see some gains this year, and that is without even considering the big R word.

Edit: figured out how to add the image.

5,VRT,A closer look at Microsoft news – buy the AI dip?,"As is usual before NVDA earnings, FUD is being spread about the ‘AI trade.’ I find this situation again reminiscent of the DeepSeek panic which NVDA and other AI plays quickly rebounded from in about a week (see my previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1icdu1d/deepseek_training_cost_the_95_mil_difference/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) highlighting the blatant misunderstanding of renting GPUs for $5.6m vs. total cost of ownership for AI infrastructure in $100s of billions).

**The FUD: ‘data center oversupply’**

Headlines have been coming out that Microsoft walking away from a “couple hundred MWs” of datacenter leases (note, this would likely represent &lt;5% of their overall estimated 5 GW installed capacity). Analysts are also insinuating this means there is a larger ‘oversupply’ and therefore AI capital expenditures will be slowing down.

*“TD Investment bank claims software giant ditched 'at least' 5 land parcels due to potential 'oversupply'”*

 

**The Critique: Dip Buying Opp?**

First off, it is not clear if these MSFT leases are for high-performance compute (GPUs for AI workloads) or traditional non-AI cloud (for things like storage, where demand has been waning). For the sake of argument, let’s assume this was for AI compute.

**Point 1** \- Overall, Microsoft is not slowing down. After the TD report on Friday, Microsoft [reiterated they are not cutting their $80bil capital spending plan for this year](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/24/microsoft-reiterates-plan-to-invest-80-billion-in-ai-.html). So, as they are walking away from a couple hundred MWs of leased capacity, meanwhile they will be building several GWs.

**Point 2** \- In Q4, Microsoft missed cloud revenue targets. On the earnings call, CFO Amy hood noted shortfalls in Q4 performance was due to supply constraints, and the larger capex spend is expected to drive stronger Azure growth. In other words, the revenue miss was a *capacity problem*, not a *demand problem*. So why slow down now? Doesn’t add up.

**Point 3** – Open AI is adding more compute capacity with other partners (Oracle and Softbank). This would represent a ***shift*** in capital spending from Microsoft to others, i.e. this does not indicate an oversupply.

“**Microsoft is shifting some of the capital intensity of its AI initiatives on to Oracle**, but we don’t think this short-term benefit outweighs the long-run potential harm of losing the revenue and control over OpenAI.”

**Financial Overview**:  
Strong financials across the board and continue to raise guidance. 2024 guidance confirmed, data is here:

Net Sales: $7,805M, organic up 14%  
Adj. Operating Profit: $1,485M  
Adj. Operating Margin: 19.0%, up 370 bps  
Adj. Free Cash Flow: $1,000M

Fundamentally I think they have some **key advantages** that will allow for them to continue to dominate the market:

(1) AI-Demand &amp; Margin Expansion: Multiple levers for continued further expansion of adjusted operating margin to \~25% in 2029 (Slide 14 &amp; 36)  
(2) Product Leadership: Vertiv services provide unmatched critical digital infrastructure support (Slide 26-28)  
(3) Flexible Capital: $12.5B of capital deployment through 2029. Up from $6.5B at Nov 2023 Investor Day (Slide 48)  
(4) Energy Demand: Power and cooling capabilities are already crucial today, as energy demand surges, efficiency and cost will become a major factor

**Risks**  
\- AI Bubble: tbh I'm not a believer in this narrative but its something to consider since their sales are driven by AI related companies  
\- $NVDA: $VRT trades with $NVDA (so does the market in a way) but if you pull up the charts there is high correlation. Also $NVDA ER is tomorrow  
\- Valuation: They trade at a 81.86 PE ratio 

# S&amp;P 500 Inclusion

The S&amp;P 500 index rebalancing occurs 4x/year with the next one coming up. [SP Global](https://www.spglobal.com/en) announces the additions to the index which will replace companies that have underperformed and will be removed.

S&amp;P rebalancing presents an opportunity to trade based on predictions of which companies will be added/removed as there is potential for a \~5-10% price increase. In short, the rebalance forces institutions who follow certain indexes to buy the stock as it is now in the index &amp; generally there is a positive impact on company's reputation.

Although the selection committee has requirements for eligibility which can be found here: [SP 500 Criteria](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/methodologies/methodology-sp-us-indices.pdf), there is a bit of thematic flexibility. By definition the index is ""a market cap-weighted index of US large- and mid-cap stocks."" Typically companies need to be $18B or larger in market cap and historically profitable. Negative trailing EPS, high volatility, recent IPO, etc. may restrict a stock from eligibility.

Below is the **SP 500 index sector weighting** (as of Nov 14):  
Technology: 33.32% | Financial Services: 13.19% | Consumer Cyclical: 10.80% |. Healthcare: 10.54% | Communication Services: 9.03% | Industrials: 7.58% | Consumer Defensive: 5.56% | Energy: 3.44% | Utilities: 2.54% | Real Estate: 2.17% | Basic Materials: 1.83%

**Why Vertiv ($VRT)?**

* Thematic fit: the index is focused on representing the best large/mid cap companies in the US and $VRT fits the industrial/energy category (the industry will get more love under the new administration), it fits the innovation/technology aspect, and of course the energy/AI theme 
* Solid earnings and growth: self-explanatory in the company financial analysis above
* Strong momentum: this is important and imho, an underrated factor. A great example of this is Palantir ($PLTR) which btw pumped like 10% off of the news. Now I know r/wallstreetbets has a love/hate relationship with $PLTR but put that aside for now (it was added to the index around $35)

**Rebalance Timeline**: [Q4 2024 ](https://www.nyse.com/publicdocs/ICE_NYSE_2024_Yearly_Trading_Calendar.pdf)  
\*based on the usual schedule, check the website for official announcements

* Quarter End Date: Dec 31
* Announcement Date: Early December (typically 1st week)
* Rebalance Date: Dec 20 (typically 3rd Friday)

I will be waiting until after NVIDIA reports earnings on 11/20 to make any adjustments to this trade or to rethink my thesis. Would recommend this especially if you do not already have a position in $VRT. I could be completely wrong. God speed!

- $NVDA great earnings, beat expectations, and currently trading green in the pre market
- $VRT might not pull back at all since the momentum is continuing and they literally talked about the need for data centers and cooling solutions on the ER

13,VRT,MSFT Pre-Earnings Analysis: AI Arms Race and Channel Check - AI Number May Show Double Digit Growth in Q1 2025 - Monster Quarter Growth,"This might be one of Microsoft's most influential quarters in quite some time. The main argument for my thesis is OpenAI and recent AI model upgrades from in the form of GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-o1, and GPT-o1-mini. As well, I don't know if anyone noticed their Uranium portfolio's going through the roof but if not check out SMR, OKLO and others to see more. AI needs so much power that they are opening up defunct nuclear power plants on 3-mile island in Pennsylvania for new energy sources.

What most media types don't have a window into, mostly I assume this because they keep saying the same silly thing over and over again, is that enterprise is using AI. AI is not going to come in the form of a ""killer app"". The killer app is ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Mistral. Those are the killer apps but those are also not important things in the AI arms race. AI in and of in itself is the killer app. The reason for this is that it commoditized intelligence in the form of tokens that can be literally bought and sold through the cloud.

When certain media types keep railing on the notion that ""who's making money with this"" they are missing the reality in that people are making money with this each and every day. The enterprise is creating applications that are simply not understood by everyday people or analysts because there not the ""killer apps"" that people think of which represents mostly something popular that teenagers and young adults are into. Is Venmo a killer app? Is Facebook a killer apps still? I don't know maybe I'm just not with the times. What i do know is that is that AI is so large and so democratized that the use cases, while not killer, are becoming increasingly ubiquitous in the enterprise setting.

This is the fast and steady drum beat of GAI increasingly taking over all human cognitive tasks.  It won't happen overnight but it is happening. I think what is happening with the media is that they can't put a metric to it so I will attempt to.

AI adoption and penetration into everyday processes and tasks for enterprise is probably at 0.6%-1%. If you include the backlog of potential AI penetration it is probably 2 - 5% of all enterprise tasks and processes. The immediate 1 - 2 year outlook of AI penetration is probably 1 - 3% with a backlog of 6-9%. To be clear, I am not considering productivity gains because who the hell cares about any of that.  I am specifically speaking about cold hard ROI of implementing an AI automation system and having that AI do the work that was once a human task now offloading to an AI automation task.

I don't know how you feel about the above numbers but in my interpretation it is incredibly slow but growth can be incredibly exponential in relatively a short amount of time. The reason, I've written about this many times before, is because the data is not ready, the talent is not there to reconstruct and rebuild what needs to be in place to make efficient data process that are specific to AI, and many many other factors.

This is why consulting through the likes of Accenture, Palantir, IBM and others will be very important in the coming years. It's my opinion that companies now matter how large or small won't be able to put in the right processes without proven practices that will foster from consultancy groups rather than at home grown talent. However, there will be clues of how well the progress is going. An AI channel check if you will.

**AI Channel Check through Microsoft Azure:**

Microsoft provides this channel check for us. Alphabet just completed their channel check and the news on AI was good. Continued spending for all things AI and healthy numbers in their core businesses to justify the continued spend. I look for Microsoft to report much in the same way in terms of AI CapEx/Spend.

2 quarters ago Microsoft started reporting the AI portion of their Azure Cloud revenues. 2 quarters ago it was 6%, and the previous quarter it rose to 7%. For their earnings report tomorrow the AI revenue should be in the 10-12% range. In my opinion 8% is not going to cut it. 1% quarterly gain seems slow. The number in aggregate should be 2%+ quarter to quarter growth. In this way, 1% isn't going to cut it for Wall Street. Perhaps we do see 8%-9% next quarter and that wouldn't be a horrible thing but if Microsoft wants to blow the doors off of earnings and reestablish a healthy growth pattern it is of my opinion that number of percent AI revenue shares needs a meaningful bps up.

I believe that in this earnings there will be that meaningful click upwards of AI percentage growth for Microsoft in the 10%+ range. 11% would be a bust out surprise and 12% would be significantly positive. So where is this possible 3% rise in AI revenue growth coming from? Look no further than GPT-4o.

**GPT-4o and the AI Number**

Gpt-4o was initially released on May 13, 2024. For reference, Microsoft's last quarter was, Q4 2024, ended on June 30, 2024, with earnings reported on July 30, 2024. **AI number 7%**. There was no way for GPT-4o to significantly penetrate into their earnings with only roughly 30 days of usage. If you take into account the iterations of 4o itself the model initially was met with skepticism (compared to GPT-4-Turbo) and apprehension until subsequent versions of 4o were released. All-in-all, there is no way GPT-4o was going to be in the previous quarters (Q4) earnings report.

However, what's even more interesting is the increase in quota and throughput of GPT-4 to GPT-4o. This is where I believe the AI number from Microsoft will materially increase. Let's take a look.

First, let's start with **GPT-4-Turbo** which was released November 6, 2023.

Commit **e477326** was dated to Nov 22, 2023. A preview was available, 1106, as of Nov 17, 2023. Using this as a ground truth you can see that the token limit is 134k per minute with a max of 2.7 K requests per minute. this and surely prior to this was hell on enterprises to do any meaningful work with the models. It was great for experimenting and getting started but not for meaningful production work.

**GPT-4o** was released on May 13, 2024.

**Git Commit** [431bb24](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-ai-docs/blob/431bb24aadae464afbeb46a522cf613dc9418025/articles/ai-services/openai/quotas-limits.md):

Commit **431bb24** was dated to May 20, 2024. As you can see from previous GPT-4 capacity limitations GPT-4o introduced a massive improvement for quota limit TPM and requests per minute RPM. This is a significant release for enterprise customers as they can now begin to plan, develop, and execute AI software stacks into production environments. 60 K RPM's is a 22X upgrade towards production throughput.

**Git Commit** [30084ae](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-ai-docs/blob/30084aee1f0f82335490af8b4b7bd8912cc02af0/articles/ai-services/openai/quotas-limits.md):

Commit **30084ae** was dated July 24, 2024. In this update the quota TPM was raised from 10M to 30M tokens per minute.

[**Current Quota Limits**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/quotas-limits):

https://preview.redd.it/l2ah831essxd1.png?width=1153&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f59ee5eb421e81d5eb40afb16147f11b3b0c293

In the current quota limits there is a 180 K RPM increase from 60 K. At this point and earlier in the quarter OpenAI's GPT-4o models became capacity unlocked. There is nothing you cannot do or plan for in terms of AI model integrations, TPM's, or RPM throughput. At this moment, intelligence is untethered from any api constraints. What you can imagine building in terms of AI and LLMs and the delivery of those products and services can be fully realized without constraint.

If you go from the beginning analysis of GPT-4-Turbo until today there is a **223X tokens per minute (TPM) increase and a 66.66X request per minute (RPM) increase.**

This is a massive throughput gain that cannot be expressed enough of how significant this is in terms of AI advancements regarding enterprise adoption.

This is why I believe the AI Number finally breaks the double digits in this quarter of 10%+. Ever since the last quarter ended, June 30, 2024, there has been a steady stream of AI model improvements and api throughput improvements that are significant in scope. If you couple this with Google's continued AI spend and quality quarter, AI hardware channel checks that verify the AI hardware spend, and a github repo commit history that shows nothing but blazing improvements for Microsoft Azure intelligence; It could not be more clear to me that Microsoft is executing on all levels and should deliver a potentially monster quarter.

Not that it needs it but here is the plug for NVDA as well. All of those github commits and throughput improvements are directly related to Microsoft bringing data centers online all over the world.

This is insane! I don't have to tell you the git commits for this graph are absolutely bonkers too.

When does SMCI report again?",9,23,1730253399.0,2024-10-30T01:56:39+00:00,t3_1gfbrmf,wallstreetbets,"MSFT Pre-Earnings Analysis: AI Arms Race and Channel Check - AI Number May Show Double Digit Growth in Q1 2025 - Monster Quarter Growth This might be one of Microsoft's most influential quarters in quite some time. The main argument for my thesis is OpenAI and recent AI model upgrades from in the form of GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-o1, and GPT-o1-mini. As well, I don't know if anyone noticed their Uranium portfolio's going through the roof but if not check out SMR, OKLO and others to see more. AI needs so much power that they are opening up defunct nuclear power plants on 3-mile island in Pennsylvania for new energy sources.

What most media types don't have a window into, mostly I assume this because they keep saying the same silly thing over and over again, is that enterprise is using AI. AI is not going to come in the form of a ""killer app"". The killer app is ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Mistral. Those are the killer apps but those are also not important things in the AI arms race. AI in and of in itself is the killer app. The reason for this is that it commoditized intelligence in the form of tokens that can be literally bought and sold through the cloud.

When certain media types keep railing on the notion that ""who's making money with this"" they are missing the reality in that people are making money with this each and every day. The enterprise is creating applications that are simply not understood by everyday people or analysts because there not the ""killer apps"" that people think of which represents mostly something popular that teenagers and young adults are into. Is Venmo a killer app? Is Facebook a killer apps still? I don't know maybe I'm just not with the times. What i do know is that is that AI is so large and so democratized that the use cases, while not killer, are becoming increasingly ubiquitous in the enterprise setting.

17,VRT,Part 2: Archer Aviation is a Table Pounding Buy as the Grizzly Research Report Caused Over ~27% Short - Dare I say I stand with Cathie Wood,"I did some digging because I felt [my previous DD on Archer Aviation](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1for7pv/the_time_has_come_for_archer_aviation_achr_evtol/) wasn't to the standards I could be proud of and was rather light on information.

When nobody else believes I like to find the things worth believing in.

Archer Aviation is worth believing in. Adam Goldstein quite simply is getting shit done. He's just executing and has the perfect partners in United Airlines and the U.S. Military starting with deliveries to the USAF.

In the search for more information, I needed to see what the bear case was against Archer Aviation and Joby to see who the hell was causing such a massive short-interest float in these stocks. I needed to study the bear cases and see if they were correct in their thesis.

First, let's talk about the bears and in this case there are two, Kerrisdale Capital and Grizzly Research. Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a \~19% and \~22% short  in the eVTOL startups respectively.

Since we're here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe's such as, ""outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’"" or ""Joby will be a historical footnote"" or Grizzly's ""Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck"" or “metaphoric crash landing”.

Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written.

[Grizzly's article you can read for yourself](https://grizzlyreports.com/we-believe-archer-aviation-inc-nasdaqachr-is-a-lame-duck/) but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023):

1. **Misleading DoD contract:**
   * **Claim**: Archer’s **DoD contract** was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a **noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract**, with only **$1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023**, far less significant than portrayed.
   * **Reference**: ""DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023.""
2. **Flight Activity Misrepresentation:**
   * **Claim**: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a **handful of flights**, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress.
   * **Reference**: ""Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights.""
3. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants:**
   * **Claim**: Archer’s partnerships with **United Airlines** and **Stellantis** were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant.
   * **Reference**: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation.""
4. **FAA Certification Timeline:**
   * **Claim**: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive **Type Certification** for its Midnight aircraft until at least **2028**, not 2024 as Archer claimed.
   * **Reference**: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate.""
5. **Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing:**
   * **Claim**: Archer settled a legal dispute with **Wisk/Boeing** by giving **$100 million in free shares** to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims.
   * **Reference**: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing.""
6. **Incomplete Manufacturing Facility:**
   * **Claim**: Archer promised its **San Jose lab and small-scale production facility** would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines.
   * **Reference**: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023.""
7. **Stock Dilution and Early Vesting:**
   * **Claim**: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing **free shares to partners** like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense.
   * **Reference**: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early.""

All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it.

Let's take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today's date 9/28/2024.

1. **\*\*\*Misleading DoD contract:**
   * **Reality**: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft. The reality is a substantial commitment and desire from the military for mission critical operations planned for new eVTOL aircraft.
      1. **Delivery of Midnight eVTOL to the U.S. Air Force**: On **August 15, 2024**, Archer delivered its first **Midnight** eVTOL aircraft to the **U.S. Air Force** as part of its **$142 million contract** under the **AFWERX Agility Prime program**. This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer's partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results.
      2. **Use of Aircraft**: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for **personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations**, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also **pilot training, maintenance, and certification support**, further validating the value of the contract
2. **\*Flight Activity Misrepresentation:**
   * **Reality**: Archer is actually performing many flight tests and is even ahead of schedule for this activity. Grizzly actually went to the facility and took spy pictures of what seems to be parked aircraft in a hanger which proves, nothing about absolutely nothing. Funnily, they also asked in their asked neighboring businesses if they ""saw anything"" regarding test flights. LOL, I mean hmm so in other words you are asking them if they weren't doing their actual job and just watching the sky all day? Seems like a ridiculous anecdotal reference if you ask me. Also, the U.S. Military has taken part in the demonstrations so unless you are saying the U.S. Military is lying... Here are the facts since that report.
      1. **Ongoing Flight Testing**: Archer continued to make significant strides in its testing program, including manned test flights of the **Midnight** eVTOL aircraft, which directly counter Grizzly's claims about limited flight activity. Archer has since confirmed **daily test flights** in preparation for their **FAA certification** and commercial launch, demonstrating more substantial progress than what the report suggested​.
      2. **Video Footage Authenticity**: While Grizzly accused Archer of recycling video footage, post-August 2023, Archer showcased new videos of live flight tests, including those witnessed by government and military officials during demonstrations for the **U.S. Air Force's Agility Prime program**, further legitimizing their claims of frequent testing.
3. **\*\*Partnerships with Cheap Warrants:**
   * **Reality**: Since the update of this report there have been significant updates that contradict Grizzly's thesis full of criticisms of Archer's partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis. TLDR, everyone has literally doubled down their investment. These are not cheap words, warrants, or shallow commitments.
      1. **United Airlines** has continued to show strong support for Archer, having made multiple investments since 2021. In **August 2023**, United was part of a **$215 million investment** round, its third time investing in Archer. United also made a **$10 million pre-delivery payment** for 100 of Archer's eVTOLs, demonstrating continued commitment to Archer’s future aircraft​.
      2. **Stellantis**, Archer’s manufacturing partner, has similarly deepened its relationship. In **January 2023**, Stellantis committed **$150 million in equity** and began scaling up its role as Archer's exclusive manufacturing partner for the **Midnight eVTOL**. As of August 2023, Stellantis led the $215 million funding round, further solidifying its strategic alignment with Archer.
      3. **Continued Insider Investment as of July 2024**, in the face of all of this just recently in July N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million.
4. **\*\*\*\*\*FAA Certification Timeline:**
   * **Reality**: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime. Especially, when you consider the difficulty of all of this. 2028 doesn't seem optimistic but rather an inevitability. So much so, they have scored 2 out of 3/4 of the FAA Type Certification which is outstanding. They are on total track for the FAA for-credit flight testing that will allow them to make test flights with an operational in-flight test pilot which is the critical part of their Type Certification.
      1. **Significant FAA Milestones Achieved**: Archer has made substantial progress in its **FAA certification** pathway: **Final Airworthiness Criteria**: On **May 23, 2024**, Archer achieved a significant regulatory milestone when the **FAA issued the final airworthiness criteria** for the **Midnight** aircraft. This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification​. **Part 145 Maintenance &amp; Repair Certificate** and **Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate**: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations
      2. **For-Credit Flight Testing**: As of **September 2024**, Archer successfully completed **402 test flights**. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for **for-credit flight testing**, which is expected to begin in **early 2024**​.
      3. **Delivery to the U.S. Air Force**: On **August 15, 2024**, Archer delivered its first **Midnight aircraft** to the **U.S. Air Force** under the **AFWERX Agility Prime program**, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress.
      4. **Part 135 Certification**: On **August 15, 2024**, Archer delivered its first **Midnight aircraft** to the **U.S. Air Force** under the **AFWERX Agility Prime program**, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress.
5. **\*\*\*Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing:**
   * **Reality**: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative. And they argue that reliance on Wisk's autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company. What's actually misleading is how Grizzly which writes the report on August 15th seemingly did a news grab from articles written just days prior making the case in the exact opposite sentiment than what Grizzly decided to report against. it's like you know the news is not that but you want to mislead for your own purposes so you decide to spin it in the opposite direction. This wasn't a legal defeat but rather an opportunity for Archer to form a lasting partnership with boeing and a sizeable investment from them.
      1. **Collaboration Instead of Defeat**: The settlement has evolved into a **collaboration agreement** between Archer and Wisk, with **Boeing** as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become **Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology**. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft.
      2. **Boeing Investment**: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a **significant investment** in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like **Stellantis** and **United Airlines**. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome.
6. **\*\*\*Incomplete Manufacturing Facility:**
   * **Reality**: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis.
      1. **San Jose Facility**: Archer completed the installation of its **high-volume battery pack manufacturing line** at the **San Jose Integrated Test Lab** in **May 2024**. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to **15,000 battery packs per year**, a crucial step toward scaling production​.
      2. **Conforming Midnight Aircraft**: Archer’s **first conforming Midnight aircraft** is expected to be completed in **Q4 2023**, with flight testing set to begin in **early 2024**. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress​.
      3. **Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility**: In addition, Archer began construction on a **high-volume manufacturing facility** in **Covington, Georgia** in **March 2023**. This facility, projected to support the production of up to **650 eVTOL aircraft per year**, is on track for completion in **2024**, ahead of the **Midnight** eVTOL’s planned entry into service in **2025**. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to **complete construction by the end of the year** as of July 2024.
7. **\*\*\*Stock Dilution and Early Vesting:**
   * **Reality**: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis.
      1. **Stellantis Partnership**: Since **August 2023**, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing **$55 million** following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to **650 aircraft annually** once their **Covington, Georgia** facility is operational​. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders.
      2. **Wisk/Boeing Settlement**: The **Boeing/Wisk** settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to **autonomy technology**, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a **$215 million** funding round, which included other major investors like **United Airlines** and **ARK Invest**. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&amp;D costs.

As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision.

If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported.

Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August.

https://preview.redd.it/xdgt42wvnmrd1.png?width=1885&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03e74db783587a8c3b4bf1d44326a0d5ced3c474

My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute.

I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it's 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify.

While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations.

This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft.

With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares.

Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information.

**Update 2**: [This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule](https://verticalmag.com/news/faa-soon-to-release-final-sfar-for-powered-lift-aircraft):

The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation.

Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.”

“I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to \[industry\] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.”

The SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices.

Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range.

However, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR.  
“There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver \[the rule\] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.”

While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorization bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release.  
There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.",147,232,1727563998.0,2024-09-28T22:53:18+00:00,t3_1frqceh,wallstreetbets,"Part 2: Archer Aviation is a Table Pounding Buy as the Grizzly Research Report Caused Over ~27% Short - Dare I say I stand with Cathie Wood I did some digging because I felt [my previous DD on Archer Aviation](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1for7pv/the_time_has_come_for_archer_aviation_achr_evtol/) wasn't to the standards I could be proud of and was rather light on information.

When nobody else believes I like to find the things worth believing in.

Archer Aviation is worth believing in. Adam Goldstein quite simply is getting shit done. He's just executing and has the perfect partners in United Airlines and the U.S. Military starting with deliveries to the USAF.

In the search for more information, I needed to see what the bear case was against Archer Aviation and Joby to see who the hell was causing such a massive short-interest float in these stocks. I needed to study the bear cases and see if they were correct in their thesis.

First, let's talk about the bears and in this case there are two, Kerrisdale Capital and Grizzly Research. Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a \~19% and \~22% short  in the eVTOL startups respectively.

Since we're here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe's such as, ""outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’"" or ""Joby will be a historical footnote"" or Grizzly's ""Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck"" or “metaphoric crash landing”.

Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written.

[Grizzly's article you can read for yourself](https://grizzlyreports.com/we-believe-archer-aviation-inc-nasdaqachr-is-a-lame-duck/) but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023):

1. **Misleading DoD contract:**
   * **Claim**: Archer’s **DoD contract** was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a **noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract**, with only **$1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023**, far less significant than portrayed.
   * **Reference**: ""DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023.""
2. **Flight Activity Misrepresentation:**
   * **Claim**: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a **handful of flights**, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress.
   * **Reference**: ""Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights.""
3. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants:**
   * **Claim**: Archer’s partnerships with **United Airlines** and **Stellantis** were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant.
   * **Reference**: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation.""
4. **FAA Certification Timeline:**
   * **Claim**: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive **Type Certification** for its Midnight aircraft until at least **2028**, not 2024 as Archer claimed.
   * **Reference**: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate.""
5. **Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing:**
   * **Claim**: Archer settled a legal dispute with **Wisk/Boeing** by giving **$100 million in free shares** to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims.
   * **Reference**: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing.""
6. **Incomplete Manufacturing Facility:**
   * **Claim**: Archer promised its **San Jose lab and small-scale production facility** would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines.
   * **Reference**: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023.""
7. **Stock Dilution and Early Vesting:**
   * **Claim**: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing **free shares to partners** like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense.
   * **Reference**: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early.""

All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it.

Let's take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today's date 9/28/2024.

1. **\*\*\*Misleading DoD contract:**
   * **Reality**: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft. The reality is a substantial commitment and desire from the military for mission critical operations planned for new eVTOL aircraft.
      1. **Delivery of Midnight eVTOL to the U.S. Air Force**: On **August 15, 2024**, Archer delivered its first **Midnight** eVTOL aircraft to the **U.S. Air Force** as part of its **$142 million contract** under the **AFWERX Agility Prime program**. This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer's partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results.
      2. **Use of Aircraft**: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for **personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations**, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also **pilot training, maintenance, and certification support**, further validating the value of the contract
2. **\*Flight Activity Misrepresentation:**

As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision.

If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported.

Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August.

My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute.

I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it's 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify.

While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations.

This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft.

With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares.

Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information.

**Update 2**: [This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule](https://verticalmag.com/news/faa-soon-to-release-final-sfar-for-powered-lift-aircraft):

The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation.

Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.”

“I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to \[industry\] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.”

The SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices.

Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range.

However, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR.  
“There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver \[the rule\] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.”

While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorization bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release.  
There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.",0.052083276212215424,0.027719011530280113,0.9201977252960205,neutral,0.9201977252960205,0.02436426468193531
18,VRT,Thank You for your market orders,"  
Little bit of patting myself on the back today, and consolation for past losses.  Thank you for whoever bought VRT 1/17 @ 77.5 and LUNR 11/2 @ 11 calls today with market orders and not limit orders, my limit sells appreciate you very much.  
  
This morning on the bump I sold several contracts of VRT at $19.90, and around the same time I sold a single covered call for VRT at $1.25, and then about 30 minutes ago I sold a bunch of ASTS contracts that were going to expire next week for $4.70 (yes I know I held too long and missed out on a lot of gains in days prior).  
  
As of posting this, all three transactions are still the high price for the day.  


TLDR, I sold some contracts today at the high for the day (so far, still 1.5 hours to go) and I'm in a great mood, feeling very not regarded for once.

26,VRT,The next Semi-conductor / Data center play: Vertiv (VRT),"This stock has already been ripping for a while, and, like SMCI, I think it's gonna keep going parabolic. Why, you may ask? Well, let me tell you. If you watched the NVIDIA Keynote, there's something you probably missed due to your extra chromosome: If you want the most powerful Blackwell configuration, you're going to need a liquid cooling setup in your data center.

Guess what - most data centers do not currently have liquid cooling infrastructure to just plug and play your fancy new Blackwell rack.

Guess who is one of the few companies who companies who make liquid cooling infrastructure for data centers? Vertiv.

NVIDIA basically just put all the data center companies on notice: Get your shit modernized with liquid cooling, or get left behind. Blackwell is a few quarters out, and data centers are going to have to start modernizing now if they want to capture this business. Not to mention that this is likely to become the industry standard going forward as chips become more powerful, power hungry, and create more heat that can no longer be managed with air cooling. Vertiv orders are going to go off the hook - their stock already jumped 10% immediately after the NVIDIA GTC Keynote because people with brains started buying.

Their earnings are going to be some time in late April. I expect that they will guide to the moon, and the stock will follow. Check out the earnings ramp from the last 4 quarters:

This regarded on many levels of the menu, but I’ll be shorting CFG come Monday knowing that I gave it my best, which gets 0tdicked on by the market about 78% as well.

14,VRT,The concept of bag holding doesn’t make sense to me,"I completely don’t get the idea of bag holding the stock that dropped a lot and hoping it recovers one day.

Why don’t people just move on?

I mean, yes, if you really believe the drop is an overreaction that can be fixed quickly by the market, then of course you should hold it. But otherwise why not just dump and seek another big opportunity?

Taking me for example, my profile was down 10% by the bad earning reports of ANET and VRT. I accepted the fact and immediately switched to other stocks that can give me better return in the foreseeable future like NVDA, instead of waiting there for recovery. The time cost and opportunity cost is very important to me. I cannot imagine how much gain I would have lost if I decided to stick to these stocks.

When I determine whether I should be bagheld for a while, I just ask myself a question, “Imagine you are not holding it, would you buy it now?” If the answer is no (generally it is no), then I know there is no reason to stay here and should move on.

So I really don’t understand why bag holds, except the impact of the short-term trading tax — which is not a matter to me as a swing trader.

Edit: sorry ANET and VRT are bad examples (and I believe they are good companies!) and I am not against long-term investment. But from the trading perspective, I was asking more about why people would stuck in the hole probably forever, instead move on fast.",0,78,1709934781.0,2024-03-08T21:53:01+00:00,t3_1ba0g5y,stocks,"The concept of bag holding doesn’t make sense to me I completely don’t get the idea of bag holding the stock that dropped a lot and hoping it recovers one day.

16,VRT,"If I were to DCA for 2 years into two large cap value plays for long term hold, what would you recommend?","I am currently looking to put 10 percent of my investing money into 2 large caps. (The rest is going into etfs and cash, 5 percent to play with in other stocks and options). Currently I am looking at AMD for its growth potential and BTI for its value currently and nice dividend. I am curious to know if there are companies you believe would be better than these?

**Earnings Season**

Earnings season kicks off in earnest on Friday with banks such as JP Morgan, Citi and Wells Fargo. Let's look at JPM's set-up. Options are pricing about a 3.1% move. That's more than 3 of the past 4 earnings actual moves, but the stock did have a move of nearly 8% in April on earnings. That 3 for 4 of the stock staying within its expected move makes sense as stocks tend to move with or stay within their earnings expected move about 65-75% of the time. Studies have shown that the number is higher (where the expected move was more than the actual move) when IV is high, and the number is lower, when IV is low. This makes sense as the more move that is expected, the larger the range for a stock to stop in. As far as the visual expected move shown below, this is another useful way to use the expected move, and compare to recent or important levels of support or resistance. In other words, is there more to the expected move's level than just the expected move?  Are there also other technical factors at that level? For instance, JPM's upper expected move of 149.22 is roughly at the same level as the stock's most recent upper range level from Sept 18th. Its bearish expected move of 140.32 is near the stock's 200 day moving average.

https://preview.redd.it/71ypjsocddtb1.png?width=821&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd16f07f8fa9b516525dbd24eca8bb8427b5f0dc

Finally, another thing that can be helpful to look at prior to earnings is whether there is heavy open interest at nearby strikes in the stock. In JPM's case that open interest is mostly near the money on the 145 strike and on the upside is at 150. In other words, on a very small 145 could act as a small magnet, and on a move to the upside the open interest on the 150 line could act as resistance.

These are just several factors from the options market that can be helpful going into an earnings event and analyzing risk/reward, strategy, and strike selection on new or existing trades. It's good to have a checklist before selling the move or positioning directionally to get a gut level check of how far the stock could move.

# [Dow futures rise as Wall Street tries to recover from tough September](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/02/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures ticked higher Monday as Wall Street tried to start the new month, and quarter, on a solid note.
*****
&gt; Dow futures traded 164 points higher, or 0.5%. S&amp;P 500 futures rose 0.3%, and Nasdaq 100 futures were flat.
*****
&gt; Those moves came as the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell further, after finishing the previous week 18 basis points down from its mid-week high.
*****
&gt; “It’s pretty simple at this point, 10-year Treasury yield goes up, and equities likely remain under pressure,” Raymond James’ Tavis McCourt said. “It comes down, and equities rally.”
*****
&gt; Wall Street is coming off a tough month, with the Dow and S&amp;P 500 notching their biggest monthly losses since March 2020. The Dow on Friday also closed below below 29,000 for the first time since November 2020.
*****
&gt; The Dow shed 8.8% in September, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite lost 9.3% and 10.5%, respectively.
*****
&gt; For the quarter, the Dow fell 6.66% to notch a three-quarter losing streak for the first time since the third quarter of 2015. Both the S&amp;P and Nasdaq Composite fell 5.28% and 4.11%, respectively, to finish their third consecutive negative quarter for the first time since 2009.
*****
&gt; As the new quarter kicks off, all S&amp;P 500 sectors sit at least 10% off their 52-week highs. Nine sectors finished the quarter in negative territory.
*****
&gt; In the fourth quarter, elevated inflation and a Federal Reserve intent on bringing surging prices to a halt regardless of what it means for the economy will likely continue to weigh on markets, said Truist’s Keith Lerner. Oversold conditions, however, also make the market vulnerable to a sharp short-term bounce on good news, he added.
*****
&gt; “I think we could be set up for some type of reprieve but the underlying trend at this point is still a downward trend and choppy waters to continue,” Lerner said.
*****
&gt; On the economic front, Markit PMI and ISM manufacturing data are slated for release on Monday along with construction spending.

**Market Outlook:**

Stocks are looking to open higher this morning after a volatile trading session yesterday. We could see a little bounce in today's training or over the next few days, but I don't think we are in the clear yet. Russia-Ukraine tensions drove the market volatility yesterday, and a full-on invasion could complicate things. If a full-on invasion takes place, oil prices are likely to continue rising. This could also complicate things for the Fed, as they could be hiking rates right as the global economy begins slowing down and energy prices rise. I still believe we could be entering a recession. I'll be watching 434 and 435 as potential resistance levels for SPY this morning, with potential support levels at 432 and 430. If SPY is unable to get back above the 440 level by the end of the week, I'll be expecting some more weakness heading into next week. 

S&amp;P Futures are up \~80 basis points, Dow Futures are up \~70 basis points, and Nasdaq Futures are up \~1.15%. Gold and silver are trading slightly lower. Gold is still trading around the 1,900 level, and I'm still bullish here. Crude oil saw some volatility overnight and looks to be holding up over the $90 level. With the uncertainty surrounding the Russia-Ukraine situation and how sanctions will impact oil prices, I'm bullish here as well. If we see signs of de-escalation, that could change, but that's not looking likely at the moment. Energy stocks saw some selling off in yesterday's session, worth following the rest of the week. Airlines and cruise stocks are looking to open higher after the volatile session yesterday. Charts are looking bearish, but that could change if we see some considerable strength today. 

The crypto market is seeing some renewed strength this morning. Bitcoin is currently trading around 39,000. I'll be watching the 40,000 level as resistance. Ethereum is trading a bit over 2,700. Resistance in the 2,800-2,850 range, with support at \~2,500. Crypto-related stocks are seeing strength in premarket trading as a result. 

Remember to use proper risk management; size appropriately for your account and have a plan for every trade you enter. Happy trading everyone :)",2,1,1645625816.0,2022-02-23T14:16:56+00:00,t3_sziitw,StockMarket,"Morning Update for Wednesday, 2/23/22 Good morning everyone.

12,VRT,Top 5 companies by insider *selling* activity over the past month,"Yesterday I published [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/qw8ki7/ive_analyzed_the_insider_activity_of_all_us/) on insider buying activity. Today's research will be based on insider trading activity from the opposite perspective - selling activity for the last month.

It seems to me that this is an important market indicator if the insiders of a particular company sell or buy some stock, this indirectly determines the company's performance and the mood of executives. True, corporate insiders – the senior employees and executives who run the company – are privy to information that we, outsiders, are not. When these insiders sell the stock, it's only natural for outsiders to wonder if something is afoot. **However, as opposed to insider buying, insider selling doesn't tell us all that much. The reason? Insiders sell the stock for a number of reasons, the vast majority of which are unsophisticated.** 

I've been collecting data from Nasdaq and other financial sources daily for the last few months, and then aggregated it for all public US companies.

**1. Baker Hughes Company (**[**$BKR**](https://contora.ai/ticker/BKR)**)** \- provides a portfolio of technologies and services worldwide. It operates through four segments: Oilfield Services (OFS), Oilfield Equipment (OFE), Turbomachinery &amp; Process Solutions (TPS), and Digital Solutions (DS).

**2. Zoominfo Technologies (**[**$ZI**](https://contora.ai/ticker/ZI)**)** \- the company provides a go-to-market intelligence platform for sales and marketing teams.

**3. Vertiv Holdings Co. (**[**$VRT**](https://contora.ai/ticker/VRT)**)** \- together with its subsidiaries, the company designs, manufactures, and services critical digital infrastructure technologies and life cycle services for data centers, communication networks, and commercial and industrial environments in the Americas, the Asia Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.

**4. TaskUs, Inc. (**[**$TASK**](https://contora.ai/ticker/TASK)**)** \- is a provider of outsourced digital services and next-generation customer experience to innovative and disruptive technology companies.

**5. Sunnova Energy International Inc. (**[**$NOVA**](https://contora.ai/ticker/NOVA)**)** \- Sunnova provides residential solar and energy storage services in the United States. The company offers operations and maintenance, monitoring, repairs and replacements, equipment upgrades, on-site power optimization, and diagnostics services.

Take a closer look at this company. In December 2020 we see a peak in stock selling activity, and just a couple of weeks later, this was reflected in the stock price - it has been decreasing until the end of spring.

So, what does it mean if you see someone from the insiders are selling? But in the meantime, the others are holding their shares? **That is not always a red flag. But if you see a pattern of regular selling without an objective reason, it may be a good time to take note.**

As a result, looking at insider buying and selling activity can be a powerful investment sign that may help you predict future swings in stock prices. But it shouldn't be your only source of information - you can just use it in conjunction with your investment strategy.",144,12,1637261009.0,2021-11-18T18:43:29+00:00,t3_qwwibz,StockMarket,"Top 5 companies by insider *selling* activity over the past month Yesterday I published [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/qw8ki7/ive_analyzed_the_insider_activity_of_all_us/) on insider buying activity.

The reason? Insiders sell the stock for a number of reasons, the vast majority of which are unsophisticated.** 

I've been collecting data from Nasdaq and other financial sources daily for the last few months, and then aggregated it for all public US companies.

Take a closer look at this company. In December 2020 we see a peak in stock selling activity, and just a couple of weeks later, this was reflected in the stock price - it has been decreasing until the end of spring.

So, what does it mean if you see someone from the insiders are selling? But in the meantime, the others are holding their shares? **That is not always a red flag. But if you see a pattern of regular selling without an objective reason, it may be a good time to take note.**

As a result, looking at insider buying and selling activity can be a powerful investment sign that may help you predict future swings in stock prices. But it shouldn't be your only source of information - you can just use it in conjunction with your investment strategy.",0.03404488414525986,0.02577848546206951,0.9401766657829285,neutral,0.9401766657829285,0.008266398683190346
13,VRT,Significant Insider Trading Activity (Last 7 Days),"This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.

13,VRT,13 Options Plays for this Week - Journey to $1 Million is BACK,"# Major US indices pulled back Friday, but not all that much. I believe we are almost at a tipping point for an after summer correction, which will pull down the market across the board, gearing up for a run into the holiday season.  

https://preview.redd.it/1bcspupbkue71.png?width=864&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=02a41e032419f26faad300dd4bb7390095aacc6e

 Only one alert triggered Friday and that was an $**ABNB** put.  After starting on this project, I believe that $**ABNB** is overvalued and doesn't have the sustainability that the current market price implies. Therefore, I've put in two put alerts. Go small.  

https://preview.redd.it/ejhnm9agkue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40397c1f5393200798dd4c6033b186b808f6d782

 A better positions that I would prefer is entering into a bigger put at the YTD VWAP. I have already set an alert for this stronger resistance, but there is no guarantee if and when it will reach it.

#  New and Adjusted Alerts 

 $**HOOD** IPO'd last week and I will be waiting to enter at $10... (Just Kidding) I'm staying away from **Robinhood** for now.  

https://preview.redd.it/j2n60j2pkue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b8caa6b52af8d8929c9c14ba5553cd9a6df1037

&amp;#x200B;

 After a great week with $**TSLA** calls, I've entered in another similar alert as the last two. If **Tesla** pulls back to the 50MA, I'll buy more calls. However, there is a chance that $**TSLA** keeps running next week therefore I am not interested in short term puts.  

https://preview.redd.it/xusig0cqkue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=22d5c663bbebc6b93cb2bf8f818047304dcf42da

&amp;#x200B;

 $**MT** is looking a little bit overbought, and even though I and many other analysts are bullish long term, I believe that this can be a good time to lock in some quick profits. Once it consolidates toward the 50MA, or even the YTD VWAP, we can re-enter with calls.  

https://preview.redd.it/ju2q5ggrkue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd9e8be9ff1955c146f200b161d86d67da242b7a

&amp;#x200B;

 I'm really liking $**CRM** going into August. The 180MA is approaching a large volume shelf that indicates a lot of buying will happen there. More so, the YTD VWAP is lurking at those levels as well. Long term bullish on **Salesforce**, and August is historically one of the best months for the stock. October or November calls, look tempting around the $230 level.  

https://preview.redd.it/udz6h6jskue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07559317d5d5618e74012c3ab7e3ae858b4b86db

&amp;#x200B;

 

$**TSM**, **Taiwan Semiconductor**, is, I believe, an undervalued company that has a fair price of around $130+. This is a great opportunity to pick up calls for November or EOY. September and October are some of the best months for **TSM** according to Trend Spider's Seasonality Chart. At current levels, the 50, 180, and a huge volume shelf are converging. 

https://preview.redd.it/21u9xyiukue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c03a9034effbf1c0594ba5aa34a48a6db2978b4

&amp;#x200B;

 $**AXP** has had an amazing run this year August is one of the better months over the past decade. I believe consumer spending has and will increase and monthly calls or vertical spreads are perfect here.  

https://preview.redd.it/jpgpa2hvkue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c2b50116bebade25f92b68a5e8f9b4437295997

&amp;#x200B;

 **$AAP, Advance Auto Parts**, is still an interesting play for me. Everyone has probably heard by now that used car prices have gone up a lot. If we can get a consolidation around the 50MA, I think it is worth it to buy calls. However, I won't be waiting much longer for this one. I'll give it another week.  

https://preview.redd.it/g655tlewkue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0966c88748b44fd8f3317333e8233339c43c3644

&amp;#x200B;

 $**VRT** also had a good week, up from the 50MA. I'm waiting for a resistance bounce to enter some short term puts.  

https://preview.redd.it/r3kkaddxkue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87d502222fa3701d87bf608c6284efa2dbc8fad2

&amp;#x200B;

 I'm still waiting for **$X, US Steel**, to pull back to the 180ma. As you can see last it just came off a 180ma bounce, but not quite low enough to hit my trigger. I'm a patient man and I'll wait again. This is a good play going into October and November, so we have some time to enter.  

https://preview.redd.it/09oy8sgykue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea114b1ade318baa53487eac738ca13ff3002470

&amp;#x200B;

 **$AI** is to overhyped, and puts at upper resistance will pay significantly in my opinion. I've reupped the time on this alert and will wait for a bounce to enter.  

https://preview.redd.it/snkwzjizkue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=acdd5c9d6fa626471ff21cf572b84a84a18343c7

&amp;#x200B;

 One of my favorite shorts is $**EBON**. Probably by now you know I have personal experience with this company. Sort them into the ground, please. This time the alert is set to trigger at the 50 MA and I'll go into a bigger position.  

https://preview.redd.it/bgr3pqj0lue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20bef00a73ba2a1e68a0f2e2af0930cede9b9a95

&amp;#x200B;

 $**ETSY** is next and the interesting thing about this stock, since its IPO, it has never had a positive October. I will be keeping this in mind when I buy calls at support. September usually is a good month. Getting in and out of this one is most likely the key.  

https://preview.redd.it/whhewch1lue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58fd6d95a96e7fb55d0089c593522f3863b47043

15,VRT,15 Options TA - Journey to $1 Million - Remember Me?,"# INTRO - I have a feeling this week is going to be another good week for the major indices and tech. I do believe most inflation fears are priced in, have been for some time, and for the most part this is an ordinary summer. The 10 year bond has dropped right around 1.35% which will indicate what sectors we should be investing in. It seems like the lower it goes, the better tech and growth do. Traditionally cheaper money benefits these companies that carry a lot of paper. I'm not expecting any major changes on this front. Yet, I am getting ready to take profits on longer term positions and move somethings around in preparation for a bigger dip in September or August that I've been writing about for some time now.  

&amp;#x200B;

**TODAY** \- Good start to the week as the markets across the board set fresh all time highs! My portfolio is up over $10k. 

Year-to-date gains in the S&amp;P and NASDAQ are at 18% and 15% respectively and even though I am expecting a pull back after the summer, there is still more room to run towards the end of the year.

I do think that $**AAPL** will pull back, unfortunately for my LEAPS, however if it does getting into another position closer to the 180 MA is beneficial. There is no real guarantee that **AAPL** will recede all the way back down, giving up all the gains from the last couple weeks, however September is usually a horrible month for **AAPL**. In case, I will be prepared.

Next on the list of new alerts is $**ROKU**. I am not that bullish on **ROKU** and agree with Morgan Stanley giving it a sell rating. If it does rise up to the resistance trend line, it will be almost all time high. I like puts at this point.  

https://preview.redd.it/zluyryg9gva71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=438bd1a0b0657f12fa519bbfcca854a7037cf609

 **MSFT,** like AAPL, has ran up a great bit the last few weeks. Currently most indicators are showing levels of over bought. I don't want to buy puts or short **MSFT**, but if it does pull back toward the support, which it has bounce many times before, I'm a buyer.  

https://preview.redd.it/eizxl02bgva71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dafe6828303bbb45e245d62ce41b5e3b96fddebc

 

$**X** is an interesting play that I would consider pretty safe. Of course everyone has heard of lumber and the inflation that is kicking up prices. Housing prices are skyrocketing around the country and possible rents will be too. If **X** can pull back to the 180 MA I believe that is a very good level of support to buy at. 

https://preview.redd.it/8gfx26ocgva71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1182f1a0fe2cb4c0b178b0c7d12dced37615662

**ArcelorMittal,** together with its subsidiaries, owns and operates steel manufacturing and mining facilities in Europe, North and South America, Asia, and Africa. This is another steel and mining play for me. Over the past 10 years August has been the worst month of the year for $**MT**. I'll wait for a dip and hopefully buy mid to long term calls around the strong support, and if that breaks maybe the 180ma.  

https://preview.redd.it/zj34ylcegva71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a5bfcef576a2b806338bcb9c02450be11de0a50

**Vertiv Holdings Co**, together with its subsidiaries, designs, manufactures, and services critical digital infrastructure technologies and life cycle services for data centers, communication networks, and commercial and industrial environments in the Americas, the Asia Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. $**VRT** is essentially a data center and tech infrastructure play that I believe is overbought currently. **VRT** seems to be riding up towards the key resistance that it cant seem to cross, dating back to last year, 2020. I prefer puts here and take profit around the 50ma.  

https://preview.redd.it/zsypjnrfgva71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f33a77fe41d1a3e7dbd7dd023eb713799d92c732

 $**AI** is a company that, you guessed it, develops AI products. I think the ticker is really, really cool, but that's about it. I believe most of the hype probably comes from that and we can see that it sold off enormously earlier this year. Once it is up to the resistance, let's play puts back down to the big volume shelf that is providing support.  

https://preview.redd.it/8mcbb9zggva71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77e515bbde6d723ae5393c1744951a6cf5198818

 $**TNA** is a leveraged 3X ETF that follows the Russell 2000 small cap index. Small caps are more risky that large caps, of course, but usually out perform them as well. I would like to add this to my portfolio, most likely, in September to set up for a run into the holiday months. Shares are fine with me since it is leveraged.  

https://preview.redd.it/m2yx6z0igva71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e335354f9e074313436e30d2ad0e0a28f955aaf

 $**BIDU** alert that triggered late Friday. If $**BIDU** continues an upward push, through the support, I'll pick up some calls a couple months out. 

https://preview.redd.it/lwtjr5njgva71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9bbe7a38958435b63b0b7ceb1e43d8bd514936bd

 $**COIN** is my favorite BTC/Crypto stock play. It is the most reliable and regulated crypto exchange in the US. I think all the institutional investors will be using **COIN** for crypto exposure. I also don't think that the stock price should follow that of BTC. Even if BTC is down for the month, there is still selling volume taking place on **Coinbase**, there fore incoming revenue. Overall, I like this stock. If it pulls back to the MA, I think its a good entry and addition to your portfolio if you want crypto exposure.  

https://preview.redd.it/ymaldxhlgva71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=289f1e4d9130c1134ea952d51fa06158bd9c0d54

 If you are like me and waiting of a bigger pull back/correction before situating your portfolio for a bigger run toward the end of 2021, I'll be taking profits in some of my positions and needing a place to park the money in the interim. I've identified a few that could be good for this. First is **VTV,** Vanguard Value ETF. It is a ETF that is focused on Value stock play and has a Dividend yield of more than 2%. It is usually considered a 'safe' place to park money. Some top holdings include, BERK, JPM, XOM, JNJ, UNH, and PG.  

https://preview.redd.it/2dcxclpmgva71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03de8f2f07a832d6042fbbff5c6b5298ad3438b0

 Another one is **SCHD**, also has a Dividend yield of over 2%. Some of Schwab Div Yields top holdings are MRK, TXN, HD, PEP, and VZ.  

https://preview.redd.it/f5o5q8nngva71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f597984b4adabd4f6417c313c57576644024f6ee

 Another interesting addition to your portfolio could be **XHB**. It is a homebuilders ETF. There has been huge demand for new SF homes in the US, and **XHB** and NAIL have done very well this year with the inflation trade. I don't expect demand to considerably change anytime soon. I always buy on support, so patience is key until **XHB** pulls back a little bit more.  

https://preview.redd.it/g8vck4xogva71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9dd3c23232ccdc439a93b7dd9f2d20c7a808955

 **DIS** just released Black Widow and did very very well this weekend. Overall I like what the company is doing with **Disney**\+ and in Shanghai they are raising the ticket prices for the newest Disney theme park. Be careful when buying this for two reasons. One, a lot of good news could already be priced in - and probably is. Two, August through October have been horrible months for **DIS** over the past 10 years. If you are a **DIS** bull, buying on the 180MA is your best bet for now.  

https://preview.redd.it/6lorao9qgva71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3dc8230c7f288c8d06b14df0d824a8b18bb69346

 

**$TASK** provides outsourcing services to Internet companies worldwide. It offers digital customer experience that consists of omni-channel customer care services primarily delivered through digital channels; and other solutions, including customer care services for new product or market launches, trust and safety solutions, and customer acquisition solutions.

All of the major analysts, except Morgan Stanley have a 'buy' rating for the stock. I personally like their vision and what they are doing. Their IPO wasn't long ago and there isn't much data out so far, however I think there is upside toward $40+. Currently I want to buy commons sub $30 if the opportunity comes, or sell puts if options are enabled on Webull.

I do believe most inflation fears are priced in, have been for some time, and for the most part this is an ordinary summer. The 10 year bond has dropped right around 1.35% which will indicate what sectors we should be investing in. It seems like the lower it goes, the better tech and growth do. Traditionally cheaper money benefits these companies that carry a lot of paper. I'm not expecting any major changes on this front. Yet, I am getting ready to take profits on longer term positions and move somethings around in preparation for a bigger dip in September or August that I've been writing about for some time now.  

&amp;#x200B;

**TODAY** \- Good start to the week as the markets across the board set fresh all time highs! My portfolio is up over $10k. 

Year-to-date gains in the S&amp;P and NASDAQ are at 18% and 15% respectively and even though I am expecting a pull back after the summer, there is still more room to run towards the end of the year.

* Increased Computing Capacity Demands Data Center Cooling Innovation



* Enhancing Data Center Energy Efficiency with New Technologies

*Where Is Data Center Cooling Innovation Coming From?*
&gt;During the second part of its conference, Vertiv demonstrated and discussed some of its cooling technologies, including:

&gt; Direct Expansion Cooling (which includes the new Liebert® PDX with variable speed compressors)
Chilled Water Cooling (including the Liebert (P C W) indoor cooling unit, Liebert (O F C) and Liebert (A F C) chillers)
Outdoor Package Solutions (including Liebert (E F C) and Liebert (D S E))
As data centers get bigger, they need innovative cooling technologies to reduce their carbon emissions and help them meet targets for energy efficiency.

&gt; In particular, refrigerants are a “key driver” of sustainable data centers, said Roberto Felisi, Senior Director, Global Offering Management Core Systems at Vertiv, adding that it is important to have industry certifications to measure the energy efficiency of data center cooling products.

&gt; Other trends in the data center market discussed during the event included growing demand for modular, prefabricated data centers, which are typically smaller and quicker to deploy than traditional ones.

&gt; Lambrecht, said that most of the increasing number of modular Edge data centers will not have staff working in them. That will mean they need to be monitored remotely and have self-repairing technology, he said.

&amp;nbsp;



&gt; In the final interactive Q&amp;A session, *panelists and conference delegates discussed how liquid cooling would help data centers become more environmentally sustainable. Attempts to agree industry standards for cooling technologies, including the Open Compute project, are at an early stage, but they may help achieve this goal.*

&gt;Despite a tumultuous year, speakers and delegates at the event remained upbeat about the future of cooling technologies and the data center industry.

18,VRT,Significant Activist Hedge Fund Activity (Last 7 Days),"
These are the latest Schedule 13D forms filed by activist investors in the last 7 days. Activist
investors are investors that make an investment with the intention of influencing management in some way.
There is evidence that following activist investors into investments can generate excess returns.
Schedule 13G forms, in contrast, are filed by significant investors with no intention of influencing management
(such as Index funds).

There is always a lot of interest in insider trades, but what a lot of people probably don't realize
is that hedge fund activity is probably more predictive of future returns than insider activity.
The reason is that hedge funds (a) have large research budgets, and (b) have a choice where to put their money.
In contract, insiders have no choice where to put their money, but only when to time their transactions.

## New Filings
This table lists new 13D filings in the last week. A new filing does not necessarily indicate a new position,
as investors frequently accumulate in advance before reaching the filing threshold.

Source: [Fintel.io/activists](https://fintel.io/activists)",22,1,1598477195.0,2020-08-26T21:26:35+00:00,t3_ih7uki,StockMarket,"Significant Activist Hedge Fund Activity (Last 7 Days) 
These are the latest Schedule 13D forms filed by activist investors in the last 7 days. Activist
investors are investors that make an investment with the intention of influencing management in some way.
There is evidence that following activist investors into investments can generate excess returns.
Schedule 13G forms, in contrast, are filed by significant investors with no intention of influencing management
(such as Index funds).

There is always a lot of interest in insider trades, but what a lot of people probably don't realize
is that hedge fund activity is probably more predictive of future returns than insider activity.
The reason is that hedge funds (a) have large research budgets, and (b) have a choice where to put their money.
In contract, insiders have no choice where to put their money, but only when to time their transactions.

## New Filings
This table lists new 13D filings in the last week. A new filing does not necessarily indicate a new position,
as investors frequently accumulate in advance before reaching the filing threshold.

They've brought in what is on paper a all star executive team including David Cote who ran Honeywell during their run up from 2002 - 2017.

What is the long-term outlook for this company? Is it for growth investors? I like the business model and industry is going to continue to growth but I'm very underwhelmed by their sales growth. 

Anyone also doing research on this and can shed some light as to a bull thesis for their growth?
