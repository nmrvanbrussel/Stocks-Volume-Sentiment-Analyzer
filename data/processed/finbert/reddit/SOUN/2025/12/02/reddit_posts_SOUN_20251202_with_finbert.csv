4,SOUN,SOUN and BLNK. 2 stocks I will watch this week.,"
Soundhound and Blink Charging are both on the path of finding their footing I believe and are both worthy of people taking the opportunity to buy their public shares this upcoming market week. SOUN is approachable and has free ai apps that still make money with subscriptions that lightly surpass decent. It specializes in conversation, music discovery, and more. Although I personally have doubted their ability to specialize in one thing, I believe their Ceo and management is highly capable and strategic and growth oriented.

Blink charging to me is an electric car charging company that is under the radar and will keep climbing the ladder. They aren’t afraid to take their craft and target underfunded areas, and assert themselves as a household name while still having a ways to go. I also think environmentally and efficiency wise, these type of companies we'll only see more of.

BLNK was able to beat analyst estimates of earnings per share in Q3 CY2025 by 1 cent ($-0.10 vs $-0.11). They also reduced their cash burn by 87 percent. It receives decent government funding from both the U.S and the U.K since it's also expanded there recently. A couple months ago they received 280k pounds of government funding. And as for the United States, less than a week ago it was announced they were rewarded a Sourcewell contract to expand and help government agencies.

SOUN reported a Q3 68% revenue growth recently. And NVIDIA, a powerful partner of Soundhound has done some support for them recently as well with the chief executive publicly backing up the smaller company and helping the stock go up 12% in one day.

These are companies i've had my eye on for some time now and believe that now that they've kind of been in the red lately, this means we could see upward motion with them soon, possibly this week. I know they aren’t very related but I just felt like talking about what moderate to high risk stocks i'm interested in as of now. Also this is not financial advice. I'm talking about these stocks in relation to how my investment style is and my personal intuition.",8,8,1763957089.0,2025-11-24T04:04:49+00:00,t3_1p577r7,SmallStreetBets,"SOUN and BLNK. 2 stocks I will watch this week.

1,SOUN,My Market Outlook &amp; Position Adjustments (11/13),"The markets continue to be highly volatile - NASDAQ slipped about 2.3% today, and most portfolios took a noticeable hit. As an option seller, I decided to close a few of my covered call (CC) positions. It’s never ideal to close calls when the underlying is dropping, but locking in profits remains one of the most important principles of consistent selling. I plan to reopen CCs in the coming days once call premiums recover, but at the moment, call premiums are pretty crushed.

That said, this is an excellent time to open CSPs.

From my perspective (and this is purely my opinion - I could be proven wrong tomorrow), the markets are likely to remain volatile and slightly bearish until NVIDIA’s earnings on 11/19. The AI rally seems to be losing steam as revenues aren’t growing at the previously projected pace, creating a temporary slowdown in what has been an over-priced market.

**Closed Position**

* **AAOI → $30 Call (opened 11/10)**, premium 0.55 **→** closed at 0.10. Net premium profit = 0.45 (\~82% of premium captured, \~1.05% of capital).
* **SOUN → $18 Call (opened 11/10)**, premium 0.21 **→** closed at 0.05. Net premium profit = 0.16 (\~76% of premium captured, \~0.88% of capital).
* **ACMR → $30 Put (opened 11/05)**, premium 1.40 **→** closed at 0.45. Net premium profit = 0.95 (\~68% of premium captured, \~3.17% of capital). Had to close this position early to free up cash as I got a margin call warning.

I did not open any new positions today. I will wait to see how the market behaves tomorrow - if it stays bearish, I will look to open CSPs. If market moves up and premiums improve then will open CCs.

2,SOUN,How Do You Handle Stop-Losses and Profit-Taking on Options? (Using SoundHound as My Example),"Hey traders -- looking for some guidance on best practices for managing risk with options.

I’ve been trading $SOUN (yeah, the volatile AI voice stock). last year I rode it to $25, didn’t lock profits, and watched it sink to $4.  
now I’m back in with a mix of shares and options --- and I want to handle this run differently.

current positions:

* **Shares:** 1,111 @ $14.28 avg → up \~47%
* **Options:**
   * 18x $19/$31 call spreads (Nov 21)
   * 4x $18/$25 call spreads (Nov 21)
   * 2x $20 calls (Jan 2028 LEAPS)  

I’ve been reading about trailing stops for shares — but when it comes to **options**, opinions seem all over the place.

so I’m asking the pros here:  
👉 what’s your go-to **stop-loss or profit-taking rule** on short-dated call spreads?  
👉 do you trail by % gain (like 25–30%) or by underlying price movement?  
👉 how early do you usually close before **IV crush** hits around earnings?  
👉 when does **theta decay** actually start biting enough that you roll early?

I’m up 25–35% on the November spreads, and I want to avoid giving it back if volatility drops.  
what would *you* do differently here — scale out, roll, tighten stops, or something else?

Any insights or examples appreciated.

24,SOUN,30K YOLO on uiPATH - The $PATH to generational wealth,"Greetings fellow crayon eaters, if you’ve been missing this AI bubble that is just getting started, then you’re a pathetic loser. *BUT you’re in luck*, because i’m here to present you with a play that is ready to run 1000%, and is actually… dare i say, UNDERVALUED in this market environment. Only up 18% YTD? Pathetic. This has the potential for upwards of **$40-50** ***THIS YEAR***

The ticker? $PATH

And it's your PATH to finally getting a  taste of the big gains this market has to offer.

**What the fuck does PATH do?**

In short, PATH builds Robotic Process Automations (RPAs) to automate repetitive tasks. Meaning, path will probably build the AI that runs the robot that replaces you, so hopefully your wife’s boyfriend can support you both. For more details, search the fucking internet, idiot. I gotta keep it short enough for your attention span. 

**Why is PATH so beaten up?**

It came too early… *just like you*, loser. 

PATH went public in 2021 at $65.50 per share. It was seen as a next generation darling by Aunt Cathie Wood, and pumped to an all time high of 90. BUTTT…  the overall market and economy was not ready for what PATH had to offer: Robotics and AI. If you’re not brainrotted too much to remember 2021, the hype was EVs and green energy. Nobody gave a shit about AI or robotics. Then the 2022 bear market came and wiped the speculative stocks. PATH was a victim of that.

The nail in the coffin was May 29, 2024, when the company announced a CEO change and lowered their yearly guidance. The stock dropped 30% that day and still has a gap there. Aunt Cathie ended up selling for a loss… (you know what that means!) 

Since then it found a floor of $10 a share which it has tested multiple times.

https://preview.redd.it/rmbrdz23ovtf1.png?width=938&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f59af1605fcf421a3264968abe2ef0eef65d4ecd

**Today is a completely different story**.

PATH has stumbled into a fucking golden opportunity…. AI, robotics, and automation. They have weathered the storm of CEO change, and have established reliable income streams.

**2025 Partnerships:**

**As of October 2025, PATH has established new partnerships with:**

**Nvidia, OpenAI, Salesforce, and Snowflake. Yeah thats right, the motherfucking work horses of the modern market, NVDA and OPENAI**

This is IN ADDITION to their existing partnerships and clients: Microsoft, Google Cloud, SAP, and Amazon. 

**Earnings trends:** *PATH has beat revenue expectations 8 times in a row… and beat EPS expectations 7 of the last 8 earnings.* 

https://preview.redd.it/d8x0jx17ovtf1.png?width=917&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e38c9aa90ea87072a1fe66d38c756b2a98dbe32

**What’s next?**

PATH has projected both EPS and revenue growth. The best part? Projections have not been raised since the new partnerships, meaning PATH is poised to surprise to the upside for earnings in December, and the market is *just now beginning to price that in.*

**TA / Options pricing - THIS IS BIG**

Bullish all time macD reversal with a gap to fill at $19. Resistance at 15, but setup to break through it after four tests by bulls in the past year, and recently with incredible volume not seen since the gap down from the CEO leaving, indicating big money is poised to capture the upside. 

***IV is considerably low at for at the money options when compared to the IV of other AI stocks, it’s currently sitting at 60-75%. This is HUGE. Options are currently critically undervalued for a stock that is poised to break to the upside and be major AI play for the year.*** 

In comparison, other market AI darlings like RZLV iv 141% for at the money, APLD 137%, SOUN 110%, RR 190%

*For you smooth brains, this means call option prices have room to absolutely skyrocket once this breaks out.* 

Current short interest per fintel is 12%. Short interest can help drive the upside breakout as shorts look to exit near 5 year lows as Bulls once again take charge.

Since dropping to $10 a share, we can see from the volume profile that there has been significant accumulation of shares in the $10-14 range, and we are just beginning to break away from that into a volume gap that will eventually take the stock into the $20's

It's just broken over the 200D MA and backtested it, bouncing hard following a small dip from profit taking after the NVDA partnership announcement.

Only up 18% YTD? Pathetic. This has the potential for upwards of **$40-50** ***THIS YEAR***

The ticker? $PATH

And it's your PATH to finally getting a  taste of the big gains this market has to offer.

**What the fuck does PATH do?**

In short, PATH builds Robotic Process Automations (RPAs) to automate repetitive tasks. Meaning, path will probably build the AI that runs the robot that replaces you, so hopefully your wife’s boyfriend can support you both. For more details, search the fucking internet, idiot. I gotta keep it short enough for your attention span. 

**Why is PATH so beaten up?**

It came too early… *just like you*, loser. 

PATH went public in 2021 at $65.50 per share. It was seen as a next generation darling by Aunt Cathie Wood, and pumped to an all time high of 90. BUTTT…  the overall market and economy was not ready for what PATH had to offer: Robotics and AI. If you’re not brainrotted too much to remember 2021, the hype was EVs and green energy. Nobody gave a shit about AI or robotics. Then the 2022 bear market came and wiped the speculative stocks. PATH was a victim of that.

The nail in the coffin was May 29, 2024, when the company announced a CEO change and lowered their yearly guidance. The stock dropped 30% that day and still has a gap there. Aunt Cathie ended up selling for a loss… (you know what that means!) 

Since then it found a floor of $10 a share which it has tested multiple times.

https://preview.redd.it/rmbrdz23ovtf1.png?width=938&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f59af1605fcf421a3264968abe2ef0eef65d4ecd

**Today is a completely different story**.

PATH has stumbled into a fucking golden opportunity…. AI, robotics, and automation. They have weathered the storm of CEO change, and have established reliable income streams.

**2025 Partnerships:**

**As of October 2025, PATH has established new partnerships with:**

**Nvidia, OpenAI, Salesforce, and Snowflake. Yeah thats right, the motherfucking work horses of the modern market, NVDA and OPENAI**

This is IN ADDITION to their existing partnerships and clients: Microsoft, Google Cloud, SAP, and Amazon. 

**Earnings trends:** *PATH has beat revenue expectations 8 times in a row… and beat EPS expectations 7 of the last 8 earnings.* 

https://preview.redd.it/d8x0jx17ovtf1.png?width=917&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e38c9aa90ea87072a1fe66d38c756b2a98dbe32

**What’s next?**

PATH has projected both EPS and revenue growth. The best part? Projections have not been raised since the new partnerships, meaning PATH is poised to surprise to the upside for earnings in December, and the market is *just now beginning to price that in.*

**TA / Options pricing - THIS IS BIG**

Bullish all time macD reversal with a gap to fill at $19. Resistance at 15, but setup to break through it after four tests by bulls in the past year, and recently with incredible volume not seen since the gap down from the CEO leaving, indicating big money is poised to capture the upside. 

***IV is considerably low at for at the money options when compared to the IV of other AI stocks, it’s currently sitting at 60-75%. This is HUGE. Options are currently critically undervalued for a stock that is poised to break to the upside and be major AI play for the year.*** 

In comparison, other market AI darlings like RZLV iv 141% for at the money, APLD 137%, SOUN 110%, RR 190%

*For you smooth brains, this means call option prices have room to absolutely skyrocket once this breaks out.* 

Current short interest per fintel is 12%. Short interest can help drive the upside breakout as shorts look to exit near 5 year lows as Bulls once again take charge.

Since dropping to $10 a share, we can see from the volume profile that there has been significant accumulation of shares in the $10-14 range, and we are just beginning to break away from that into a volume gap that will eventually take the stock into the $20's

It's just broken over the 200D MA and backtested it, bouncing hard following a small dip from profit taking after the NVDA partnership announcement.

9,SOUN,To Roll Or Not To Roll?! 🎲📈🚀❓,"...THAT IS THE QUESTION!! 👋 What's good, degenerates?! I need a sanity check before I YOLO myself into another “learning experience.”  I actually don't think  I'm wrecked here,  but I think I could be positioned better.

Play #1: SOFI $26C 10/10 .. grabbed it before realizing earnings are end of month.. . Thinking about rolling to 11/7 or 11/14 now that I know.. Been studying options for like 3 years now.. . dabbled in LEAPS and sell covered calls on my long SOUN position.. Had a couple good ones.. and a few that slapped me back to reality. Fast forward to now.. this one's IV looks hella juicy.. I get to see how a short-term call moves.. I can afford to lose max loss.. and I’m confident SOFI’s gonna climb.. . This option stood out as my quick-gain play.. not too much risk but a little thrill. I'm just wondering if there’s more upside holding till right before earnings on the 28th or if it’s smarter to take profit and reset before the run-up.. So it’s not “will these print?” it’s “will I print more if I roll past earnings and is it worth the cost?”  Should I snag a call expiring November 7th or 14th in the AM? Or would it even be smarter to just turn this into a whole ass LEAP and go Jan 2026? If anybody could teach me the mechanics behind choosing the most profitable expiration for your strategy and situation? And if there is any useful wisdom or rules of thumb to be told about expirations or the Greeks—please... I'm listening!!! 

Play #2: RR (Richtech Robotics) $6C 10/31 .. yeah, I bought high.. yes, it’s red.. . but I’m betting on a pop going into the NVIDIA conference on the 27th.. . Rumor is they’re showing off a new humanoid robot.. . If I plan to exit a few days before, is it better to keep the close expiry or roll out for less decay?

Appreciate any wisdom from the cult of the green line..

**$SOUN** provides voice enabled platforms for cars, restaurants, and customer support. They sell voice solutions to businesses. It’s still early stage and not fully profitable, but the growth potential is there.

**$OPEN** is a tech driven home buying and selling company. They give homeowners instant cash offers, flip houses, and offer extra services like title and escrow. Their revenue swings a lot with housing market cycles and management moves.

**$RR** makes service robots for hospitality, restaurants, warehouses, and cleaning. Some robots handle drinks, deliveries, or cleaning, basically taking over repetitive human tasks. Deployment is growing, but profitability is still in the early stages.

All three companies are using technology or systems to replace or streamline traditional processes. None of them are rock solid profitable yet, so stock swings can be wild. News, market sentiment, or sector trends can make big moves in either direction. Their solutions have large potential markets. Voice platforms can be scaled across industries, Opendoor targets the massive US housing market, and RR’s robots can be applied wherever service humans are needed.

Of course, there are risks, costs are high (development, deployment, maintenance), market adoption isn’t guaranteed, competition is fierce, and management/operational risks exist (e.g., OPEN had CEO changes recently).

23,SOUN,My thoughts on some small-cap AI stocks,"Recently, I have looked into several small-sized companies in the AI sector. They operate in different niche segments, boasting certain structural flexibility and logical industry linkage, making them worth attention for those interested in tech trends.

**Astera Labs (ALAB)**

Focuses on AI data center interconnection technology. It is a core supply chain partner for clients like NVIDIA and Amazon, and is known as the ""underlying connector in the AI era.""

Reminder: Its valuation is relatively high, and market attention is concentrated. If its financial performance fails to meet expectations or the tech sector adjusts, price volatility may intensify.

**SoundHound AI (SOUN)**

Specializes in voice AI. Its products have been integrated into the systems of automakers such as Hyundai and Kia, and it has formed a certain ecological linkage with OpenAI. Its revenue has grown significantly in the past few quarters.

Reminder: It has a small scale and is still in the early stage of investment for profitability. The market is quite sensitive to its growth path, so it is necessary to dynamically monitor the progress of key collaborations and earnings guidance.

**Iris Energy (IREN)**

Covers both AI server deployment and computing infrastructure. It has a dual-driving logic of digital assets and high-performance computing, offering great room for development narratives.

Reminder: Its performance is significantly affected by industry cycles, especially reacting quickly to fluctuations in the Bitcoin or GPU markets. It is recommended to pay attention to the progress of its AI business in the revenue structure.

**Amprius Technologies (AMPX**)

Focuses on silicon anode battery solutions, targeting high-power consumption mobile platforms such as AI terminal devices and drones, and has leading advantages in technical parameters.

Reminder: It is still in the early stage of scaling up, with concentrated order sources. The pace of industrial chain expansion may bring phased adjustments to its valuation and development rhythm.

**MAASE Inc. (MAAS)**

Its intelligent unmanned car wash system integrates machine vision and IoT platforms to achieve highly reliable operations; its mobile charging robot network solves the pain points of new energy refueling; and it uses AIoT technology to manage scarce reference resources, injecting core momentum for intelligent upgrading into traditional big health and energy services, demonstrating strong application-layer integration capabilities.

Summary: These companies have topic appeal and certain technological advantages. However, they feature flexible structures, high price volatility, and sharp reactions to news. They are suitable for experienced investors to observe with a small position while conducting dynamic tracking.",1,2,1756372347.0,2025-08-28T09:12:27+00:00,t3_1n27cgr,SmallStreetBets,"My thoughts on some small-cap AI stocks Recently, I have looked into several small-sized companies in the AI sector.

3,SOUN,Best stocks to bet against if you are bearish on AI.,"Aside from the obvious ones like NVDA, MSFT, META, which tickers would be suitable for shorting or buying puts on, if you are bearish on AI and believe we are in a bubble akin to the dot-com boom?

I see that there are two general categories companies can be placed into:

1. Those which actually provide some kind of AI infrastructure/software that other companies are using and paying for. NVDA, MSFT, META are the obvious ones. But this would also include companies like INOD which provide data labeling services that MSFT/META/etc pay for; or data center/chip related companies like APLD, NVTS, SITM

2. Companies which are simply ""using"" AI in some capacity, which may be providing actual value or may be just a gimmick to increase their stock price. For example SOUN, BBAI, CRNC, PYH, ICAD, DUOT.

If you wanted to take a conservative bearish position, I think the best way to do it would be to identify those companies in #2 whose core value proposition does not include AI but who are merely claiming to use AI to ride the AI hype train. However this might be hard to do.

A moderate bearish position would be to short/buy puts on all companies in #2.

A true bearish position would be to short all companies in #1.

Calls: BCRX, BWXT, DD, ANET, ALAB, SHOP, DUOL, CELH, SOUN

Puts: BRK.B, ON, TGTX, AMD, UPST, GEO, ELF, JOBY, ESTA, SMR, PAA, PAR

**It took more than a day**

Some options expire on the 15th, so maybe more will make it, although I doubt it.

Calls: TSN, PLTR, BP

Puts: HIMS, CAT, OPEN

# Straddles that have doubled or more in value

**It took more than a day**

# Points to keep in mind

1. Data from Google Finance and Yahoo Finance.
2. Some stocks had very little or no options volume.
3. **In the post-earnings option price I am not taking into account the time value.**
4. For the strike I always use the closest to the closing price.

https://preview.redd.it/chlob1ywqvhf1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b22eeedaee44db4f79d0cdb93701474ec737eb68

A stock has no options and another did not trade any put on 08/07/2025 with strike 17.5 and I made up the price (the one in red in the last image).

Why do companies that even their CEO doesn't know appear on Earnings Whispers?

# Is there a winning strategy?

When someone posts that they've gone from 100k to 200k with one of these plays I wonder:

Why didn't that person post the 100k YOLO?

Wouldn't that person be willing to publish his losses out of shame if he lost?

There are always people betting on both sides, there are always winners and losers.

What's the point of this then?

I would love to see someone go from 1k or 10k to 1M or more with several winning bets in a row.

1k \* 2\^10 = 1,024,000

10k \* 2\^7 = 1,280,000

Can anyone really get it right 7 times in a row?

With a lot of luck, you can even multiply by more than 2 and need to get it right less often.

I hope you share your opinion. Thanks for reading.

4,SOUN,SOUN is setting up for a move. My 200k SOUN bet,"SOUN is currently low profile and I've been researching and following the stock for about two months now and here’s what i see.

To keep it simple. the chart’s in a confirmed uptrend. higher highs higher lows since may. pulled back from 13.55 to the 11s, been chopping around there for like 2 weeks. doesn’t look like a top. looks like a flag. 50 day is about to cross 200 day, golden cross coming. if it breaks 13.50 with volume, prob runs fast to 16–18.

options flow’s been good. 123k calls traded in a day (june 24). OI heavy at 12.50 and 15. if we break out, market makers gonna hedge, could pop quick. short interest is massive too, 33% of float. any positive news and this could squeeze.

fundamentals solid. rev up 151% YoY. guidance is 97% growth this year. they got 1.2B in backlog signed already, and they’re in over 10k QSR stores now. rumours going round they’re pitching mcdonalds drive-thru contract after IBM fumbled it. even a piece of that would be big.

setup right now:

* price holding above rising MAs
* golden cross any day now
* calls stacked, big OI
* short float huge
* earnings aug 7 could set it off

earnings is the main thing. if they beat and raise, we go. if they talk backlog + 2026 growth, analysts prob upgrade too. if it’s flat, it might just chop more.

positioning’s interesting, retail heavy long, instits short. so it's volatile. but i think odds favour bulls short term esp with AI hype still going. Currently doing low volume days but I believe this will change in the next few weeks.

Example of one of the AI analysis performed on HIMS

The confidence score of 61 indicates a moderate bearish outlook on the call credit spread trade on HIMS. The market conditions show a bullish trend with an RSI of 85, suggesting overbought conditions; however, there's significant time decay due to the short expiration timeframe. Fundamental analysis reveals strong revenue growth and a solid financial base, but the high P/E ratio and negative sentiment surrounding recent earnings cast doubts on sustainability. Sentiment analysis from social media platforms is mixed, indicating a lack of overwhelming bearish sentiment. The risk assessment provides a slightly favorable view due to a 97.9% probability of profit, yet volatility remains high. The strategy is well-executed with defined strikes above the current market price, while the high open interest leads to a lower likelihood of price movement beyond the short strikes. Key considerations include the risk of holding a bearish position during a generally positive market trend and potential for the stock to recover from any recent negative sentiment. Traders should monitor price action closely around the short strike and consider exiting if the trend shows bullish momentum or if the RSI indicates overbought conditions are continuing. An alternative viewpoint might argue that with significant recent price surges, there is potential for further upward movement defying short-term bearish expectations.

Example of one of the AI analysis performed on HIMS

The confidence score of 61 indicates a moderate bearish outlook on the call credit spread trade on HIMS. The market conditions show a bullish trend with an RSI of 85, suggesting overbought conditions; however, there's significant time decay due to the short expiration timeframe. Fundamental analysis reveals strong revenue growth and a solid financial base, but the high P/E ratio and negative sentiment surrounding recent earnings cast doubts on sustainability. Sentiment analysis from social media platforms is mixed, indicating a lack of overwhelming bearish sentiment. The risk assessment provides a slightly favorable view due to a 97.9% probability of profit, yet volatility remains high. The strategy is well-executed with defined strikes above the current market price, while the high open interest leads to a lower likelihood of price movement beyond the short strikes. Key considerations include the risk of holding a bearish position during a generally positive market trend and potential for the stock to recover from any recent negative sentiment. Traders should monitor price action closely around the short strike and consider exiting if the trend shows bullish momentum or if the RSI indicates overbought conditions are continuing. An alternative viewpoint might argue that with significant recent price surges, there is potential for further upward movement defying short-term bearish expectations.

6,SOUN,Week 14 $314 in premium,"I will post a separate comment with a link to the detail behind each option sold this week.

After week 14 the average premium per week is $902 with an annual projection of $46,878.

All things considered, the portfolio is down $59,833 (-19.57%) on the year and up $372 (+0.15%) over the last 365 days. This is the overall profit and loss and includes options and all other account activity.

All options sold are backed by cash, shares, or LEAPS. I do not sell on margin, nor do I sell naked options.

All options and profits stay in the account with few exceptions. This is not my full time job, although I wish it was. I still grind on a 9-5. 

Today started a $600 per week contribution streak. The next goal is $400k; although it has been a rough start. I will continue to post through the carnage for better or worse. 

The portfolio is comprised of 91 unique tickers up from 96 last week. These 91 tickers have a value of $214k. I also have 150 open option positions, down from 155 last week. The options have a total value of $31k. The total of the shares and options is $245k. 

I’m currently utilizing $25,800 in cash secured put collateral, up from $25,500 last week.

I sell options on a weekly basis. I prefer cash secured puts and covered calls. Sometimes I’m ahead of the indexes and sometimes I’m behind. My goal is consistency in option premium revenue.

11,SOUN,Summary of Nvidia’s Latest 13F Filing Of Their Investments,"Nvidia (NVDA) just released its latest **13-F filing**, revealing it's shifts in its investment portfolio. Every quarter, institutional investors with over $100 million in assets have to disclose their holdings, and these updates often hint at where big money sees opportunity. Nvidia made some notable changes this time.

**Exited Positions:**

Nvidia has completely divested from the following companies:

* **SoundHound AI (SOUN):** Specializes in developing voice AI technology for applications in smart devices, call centers, and automotive systems.
* **Serve Robotics (SERV):** Focuses on creating autonomous delivery robots designed for sidewalk transportation, aiming to revolutionize last-mile delivery.
* **Nano-X Imaging:** Develops digital X-ray technology aimed at making medical imaging more affordable and accessible worldwide.

**Reduced Stake:**

In addition to these exits, Nvidia has reduced its stake in:

* **Arm Holdings (ARM):** Despite Arm's central role in the AI chip industry, Nvidia decreased its holdings by 44%, possibly signaling a shift in investment focus.

**New Investments:**

* **WeRide Inc.:** A Chinese startup specializing in autonomous driving technology, contributing to advancements in self-driving vehicles.
* **Nebius Group N.V.:** An AI cloud infrastructure provider, offering scalable solutions for AI applications across various industries.

**Retained Holdings:**

* **Recursion Pharmaceuticals (RXRX):** An AI-driven drug discovery biotech company focused on accelerating drug discovery and development through machine learning and automation.
* **Applied Digital Corp. (APLD):** A provider of high-performance computing and digital infrastructure services.

The only one I own at the moment is a MedTech company INBS ($1.75).  They have a new device that does rapid drug testing by only using your fingerprint. So instead of sending blood and urine samples to the lab for testing and waiting a couple days for the results, they can now simply use your fingerprint and get an instant result right there on the spot.  It's currently pending FDA approval due next month. We already know that Musk and DOGE will definitely start drug testing Fed employees soon.   All of the IRS is probably stoned, lol.

Let me know if you guys have any stock recommendations that are not ai related.  I'm looking for penny stocks with a good catalyst.  

Thanks for any input!

1,SOUN,SoundHound: AI Hype Can’t Mask Weak Fundamentals,"**Summary:**

* SoundHound's stock price has surged due to the Amelia acquisition, but organic growth remains weak, and losses are substantial.
* The company operates in highly fragmented markets with growing competition, making substantial profits unlikely.
* The current extreme valuation seems unsustainable given poor fundamentals, though AI hype and growth via acquisitions may delay a correction.

SoundHound’s (NASDAQ: SOUN) stock has seen a dramatic pullback recently after an earlier surge driven by the acquisition of Amelia. While the acquisition has bolstered headline growth figures, SoundHound continues to face challenges in generating organic growth, and its financial losses remain significant. The company’s previous acquisitions have drawn attention to its underlying weaknesses, with critics pointing out that inorganic growth has been used to offset disappointing performance in core operations. Although the stock price has risen by over 200% since earlier criticism, the fundamentals offer little support for its current valuation.

Market enthusiasm for AI and speculative growth potential may continue to buoy the stock in the short term. However, achieving the level of growth required to justify the current valuation will be extremely challenging for SoundHound. The company's reliance on acquisitions suggests that organic scalability remains elusive, and its size makes future acquisitions less impactful.

SoundHound has made strides in developing its technology, particularly through Polaris, a multimodal foundation model trained on billions of conversations and millions of hours of audio. This model promises greater accuracy and lower hosting costs, which SoundHound has been gradually rolling out across its customer base. Polaris currently powers a third of SoundHound's AI interactions with restaurant customers, with plans to expand this coverage further. Additional advancements, such as reducing hallucinations and improving performance in noisy environments like vehicles, are also being pursued. However, given the company’s two-decade history, it is unclear if technological limitations have been the primary factor hindering its growth.

The automotive segment, one of SoundHound’s primary markets, has shown limited success despite the company’s long-standing presence. LLMs have enabled significant improvements in voice AI, but questions remain about whether voice interfaces will achieve widespread adoption or remain a niche feature. Vehicles represent one scenario where voice AI offers clear advantages, but even this market faces challenges. The anticipated rollout of advanced driver-assistance systems and autonomous driving features may reduce the need for voice AI in vehicles, limiting its potential market.

While SoundHound has reported some traction in the automotive industry, including deals with four EV OEMs and growth in markets like the Middle East, China, and India, its overall impact remains modest. Automotive revenue is estimated to be below $40 million annually, and the company continues to rely heavily on its relationship with Stellantis. Recent milestones, such as the integration of Chat AI into vehicles from brands like Alfa Romeo and Citroen, have yielded encouraging results, including increased usage and higher customer satisfaction scores. However, the scale of these achievements falls short of establishing SoundHound as a major player in the automotive sector.

The company’s pivot toward voice AI solutions for restaurants highlights its challenges in the automotive market. Acquisitions of Synq3 and Amelia have fueled growth in this segment, with SoundHound targeting a $1 billion revenue opportunity in drive-thru solutions. However, the reliance on acquisitions raises questions about the product’s market fit and competitive positioning. SoundHound has secured partnerships with a wide range of restaurant chains, including Panda Express, Church’s Texas Chicken, and White Castle. The company has also surpassed 100 million phone-ordering interactions, recently adding Torchy’s Tacos and a top-ten global pizza brand to its portfolio. While voice AI offers value in scenarios like drive-thru ordering, the broader adoption of touchscreens and mobile apps may limit its growth potential. Moreover, the restaurant AI market remains fragmented, with competitors like IBM, Google, and Microsoft pursuing similar opportunities.

Despite SoundHound’s claims of superior accuracy, metrics in this space are not standardized, making it difficult to assess the company’s relative performance. Various competitors have reported impressive results, such as Wendy’s FreshAI achieving an 86% success rate for fully automated orders during pilot tests. Smaller players like Hi Auto and Valyant AI have also gained traction, highlighting the competitive and fragmented nature of the market.

Financially, SoundHound’s revenue rose 89% year-over-year in the third quarter to $25 million, but this growth was primarily driven by acquisitions. Organic growth appears to have declined by roughly 50%, as prior-year figures included one-off revenue from a major automotive customer. The company has forecasted revenue of $82–85 million for 2024 and $155–175 million for 2025, suggesting minimal growth for its core business in the near future.

Profit margins have also been a challenge. Gross margins fell to 49% in the third quarter due to acquisition costs, though non-GAAP gross margins were reported at 60%. Longer-term, the company aims for gross margins of 70% or higher and EBITDA margins above 30%. However, these targets remain far from reach. SoundHound expects to achieve adjusted EBITDA profitability in 2025, though this metric excludes significant expenses such as stock-based compensation and depreciation.

SoundHound ended the third quarter with $136 million in cash and equivalents, along with $39 million in debt carrying a 15% annual cost. Management has hinted at the possibility of raising equity to reduce debt, but this would have a limited impact given the company’s current market capitalization.

Looking ahead, SoundHound’s revenue is projected to reach $275–325 million by 2029. At its current valuation, this implies a 30x forward revenue multiple—significantly higher than historical norms, even during speculative market conditions. By comparison, valuations during the peak of the SaaS boom typically ranged around 15x forward revenue. As a result, SoundHound’s stock price is likely to decline significantly unless the company can deliver extraordinary performance in the coming years.

SoundHound operates in a competitive, fragmented market and lacks clear competitive advantages. While its technology has shown promise, the broader market dynamics and the company’s poor financial fundamentals make its current valuation difficult to justify. Based on these factors, SoundHound’s stock is likely overvalued and could settle closer to $5 per share as market sentiment realigns with reality.

**TL;DR:** SoundHound has seen a surge in its stock price, driven by acquisitions and AI hype, but its fundamentals are weak, and organic growth is negative. With increasing competition in fragmented markets and a reliance on inorganic growth, the company’s current valuation appears unsustainable. A significant stock price correction seems likely.

I use Robinhood as a broker and they do not charge commissions. There is a an industry standard regulation fee of $0.03 per contract. Last year I sold just over 1,400 contracts which is just over $40.00 in fees paid YTD.

After week 2 the average premium per week is $833 and the total premium on the year is $1,665.

All things considered, the portfolio is up +$2,177 (+0.74%) on the year and up $70,319 (+30.96%) over the last 365 days. This is the overall profit and loss and includes options and all other account activity.

All options sold are backed by cash, shares, or LEAPS. I do not sell on margin, nor do I sell naked options.

All options and profits stay in the account with few exceptions. This is not my full time job, although I wish it was. I still grind on a 9-5. 

Added $600 in contributions to the portfolio for the 10th week in a row. This is a 39 week streak of adding at least $500.

The portfolio is comprised of 88 unique tickers unchanged from last week. These 88 tickers have a value of $275k. I also have 160 open option positions, up from 153 last week. The options have a total value of $22k. The total of the shares and options is $297k. 

I’m currently utilizing $34,900 in cash secured put collateral, up from $34,750 last week.

I sell options on a weekly basis. I prefer cash secured puts and covered calls. Sometimes I’m ahead of the indexes and sometimes I’m behind. My goal is consistency in option premium revenue.

I have been able to increase the premiums on an annual basis and I will attempt to keep this upward trend going forward. 

2025 &amp; 2026 &amp; 2027 LEAPS

See r/ExpiredOptions for a detailed spreadsheet update on all LEAPS positions including P/L for each individual position.

⚠️ $BBAI ⚠️

[BigBear.ai](http://BigBear.ai) Holdings, Inc. is a leading provider of AI-powered decision intelligence solutions focused on defense, national security, and enterprise markets. The company leverages data analytics, AI, and machine learning to optimize decision-making for its clients.

Key Metrics  
Market Cap: $1.05 billion  
Enterprise Value: $1.20 billion  
Current Price: $4.22  
1-Year Price Target: $3.00  
Shares Outstanding: Increased from 135M to \~160M  
Insider Ownership: 30%  
Institutional Ownership: 10%

1. [BigBear.ai](http://BigBear.ai) Holdings, Inc. presents a mix of potential and risk. While its federal contracts and positioning in the AI sector offer growth opportunities, the company faces financial challenges, including high debt, share dilution, and unprofitability. Investors should monitor insider activity, profitability trends, and market sentiment closely. The current price suggests speculative interest, but the 1-year price target highlights possible overvaluation.
   1. Contract Wins:
      * Awarded a position on the U.S. GSA’s OASIS+ MAC, a 10-year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with no maximum dollar ceiling. This provides flexible access to BigBear.ai's solutions across federal agencies.
      * Named a subcontractor in a $2.4 billion FAA contract to provide IT capabilities and emerging technologies.
   2. Debt Restructuring:
      * Exchanged $182.3M in 6.00% convertible senior notes due 2026 for new 6.00% convertible senior secured notes due 2029.
      * The exchange improves liquidity and pushes debt maturities out to 2029, though the company accrues higher interest (7% when paid in stock).
      * Following the exchange, only $17.7M of the original 2026 notes remain.
   3. Share Dilution and Insider Activity:
      * Shares outstanding increased by \~25M.
      * SEC filings show significant insider activity:
   * Revenue Growth: Q3 2024 revenue was $41.5M, up 22.3% YoY.
   * Profitability Challenges: Operating loss of $10.5M for Q3 2024.
   * Liquidity Position:
      * Current ratio: 1.52 (adequate short-term liquidity).
      * Debt-to-equity ratio: Reflects negative equity and financial instability.
   * Debt Obligations:
      * Total debt stands at \~$200M.
      * Convertible notes secured against company assets with a first-priority lien.
   * Trading Performance:
      * Stock has surged by \~99% over the past 90 days.
      * Trading volume peaked at 11.8M shares on December 26, 2024, up 16% from the prior session.
   * Technical Analysis:
      * Solid support around $2.50.
      * Similarities in chart patterns with $SOUN, which experienced significant growth in the past.
      * Current trend shows bullish momentum.
   1. Profitability Issues: Despite revenue growth, the company remains unprofitable, with ongoing operating losses.
   2. Debt and Dilution: Increased debt and share dilution may weigh on the stock's performance and shareholder value.
   3. Insider Sales: Frequent share sales by insiders could indicate a lack of confidence in the company's long-term prospects.
   4. Stock Valuation: The 1-year price target of $3.00 indicates potential downside from the current price of $4.22.
   5. Contract Pipeline: Federal contracts like OASIS+ and the FAA deal provide significant growth opportunities.
   6. AI Sector Growth: Positioned in a rapidly growing sector, with increasing demand for AI-driven solutions in defense and national security.
   7. Debt Restructuring: Extending maturities to 2029 may improve financial flexibility.

# CONCLUSION:

I don't know about this one. They're obviously trying to make it, but they certainly aren't stable and are looking to raise cash. While charts show similarities to $SOUN that went up significantly at around the same point, i don't think this correlation is good enough. They are doing serious restructuring and this tells me they are approaching the situation professionally, in a sense.  
Long term, this is certainly a solid investment imo. However short term, i think price can fluctuate about \~$1.5 or so in any direction. My general sentiment is that they would be happy to stay around this price point, and sell shares if price goes higher, as they do need more cash.  
TLDR: slow &amp; steady seems reasonable while period of exponential growth is over.

⚠️ $BBAI ⚠️

[BigBear.ai](http://BigBear.ai) Holdings, Inc. is a leading provider of AI-powered decision intelligence solutions focused on defense, national security, and enterprise markets. The company leverages data analytics, AI, and machine learning to optimize decision-making for its clients.

Key Metrics  
Market Cap: $1.05 billion  
Enterprise Value: $1.20 billion  
Current Price: $4.22  
1-Year Price Target: $3.00  
Shares Outstanding: Increased from 135M to \~160M  
Insider Ownership: 30%  
Institutional Ownership: 10%

1. [BigBear.ai](http://BigBear.ai) Holdings, Inc. presents a mix of potential and risk. While its federal contracts and positioning in the AI sector offer growth opportunities, the company faces financial challenges, including high debt, share dilution, and unprofitability. Investors should monitor insider activity, profitability trends, and market sentiment closely. The current price suggests speculative interest, but the 1-year price target highlights possible overvaluation.
   1. Contract Wins:
      * Awarded a position on the U.S. GSA’s OASIS+ MAC, a 10-year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with no maximum dollar ceiling. This provides flexible access to BigBear.ai's solutions across federal agencies.
      * Named a subcontractor in a $2.4 billion FAA contract to provide IT capabilities and emerging technologies.
   2. Debt Restructuring:
      * Exchanged $182.3M in 6.00% convertible senior notes due 2026 for new 6.00% convertible senior secured notes due 2029.
      * The exchange improves liquidity and pushes debt maturities out to 2029, though the company accrues higher interest (7% when paid in stock).
      * Following the exchange, only $17.7M of the original 2026 notes remain.
   3. Share Dilution and Insider Activity:
      * Shares outstanding increased by \~25M.
      * SEC filings show significant insider activity:
   * Revenue Growth: Q3 2024 revenue was $41.5M, up 22.3% YoY.
   * Profitability Challenges: Operating loss of $10.5M for Q3 2024.
   * Liquidity Position:
      * Current ratio: 1.52 (adequate short-term liquidity).
      * Debt-to-equity ratio: Reflects negative equity and financial instability.
   * Debt Obligations:
      * Total debt stands at \~$200M.
      * Convertible notes secured against company assets with a first-priority lien.
   * Trading Performance:
      * Stock has surged by \~99% over the past 90 days.
      * Trading volume peaked at 11.8M shares on December 26, 2024, up 16% from the prior session.
   * Technical Analysis:
      * Solid support around $2.50.
      * Similarities in chart patterns with $SOUN, which experienced significant growth in the past.
      * Current trend shows bullish momentum.
   1. Profitability Issues: Despite revenue growth, the company remains unprofitable, with ongoing operating losses.
   2. Debt and Dilution: Increased debt and share dilution may weigh on the stock's performance and shareholder value.
   3. Insider Sales: Frequent share sales by insiders could indicate a lack of confidence in the company's long-term prospects.
   4. Stock Valuation: The 1-year price target of $3.00 indicates potential downside from the current price of $4.22.
   5. Contract Pipeline: Federal contracts like OASIS+ and the FAA deal provide significant growth opportunities.
   6. AI Sector Growth: Positioned in a rapidly growing sector, with increasing demand for AI-driven solutions in defense and national security.
   7. Debt Restructuring: Extending maturities to 2029 may improve financial flexibility.

# CONCLUSION:

I don't know about this one. They're obviously trying to make it, but they certainly aren't stable and are looking to raise cash. While charts show similarities to $SOUN that went up significantly at around the same point, i don't think this correlation is good enough. They are doing serious restructuring and this tells me they are approaching the situation professionally, in a sense.  
Long term, this is certainly a solid investment imo. However short term, i think price can fluctuate about \~$1.5 or so in any direction. My general sentiment is that they would be happy to stay around this price point, and sell shares if price goes higher, as they do need more cash.  
TLDR: slow &amp; steady seems reasonable while period of exponential growth is over.

After week 52 the average premium per week is $912 and the total premiums were $47,418.

All things considered, the portfolio is up +$68,136 (+29.25%) on the year and up $65,200 (+27.64%) over the last 365 days. This is the overall profit and loss and includes options and all other account activity.

All options sold are backed by cash, shares, or LEAPS. I do not sell on margin, nor do I sell naked options.

All options and profits stay in the account with few exceptions. This is not my full time job, although I wish it was. I still grind on a 9-5. 

Added $600 in contributions to the portfolio for the 8th week in a row. This is a 37 week streak of adding at least $500.

The portfolio is comprised of 87 unique tickers unchanged from 87 in the last week. I was in the 90s for the majority of the year. As the year was winding down, I was getting rid of some losers for tax purposes. I may pick some of them up in the new year, we shall see. These 87 tickers have a value of $228k. I also have 143 open option positions, down from 144 last week. The options have a total value of $73k. The total of the shares and options is $301k. 

I’m currently utilizing $34,350 in cash secured put collateral, up from $32,350 last week.

I sell options on a weekly basis. I prefer cash secured puts and covered calls. Sometimes I’m ahead of the indexes and sometimes I’m behind. My goal is consistency in option premium revenue.

10x – SMCI: Stock started around $100 when the company began deploying its equipment and hit a high of $1,200.

4x – Palantir ($PLTR): Hesitated when it was $20 earlier this year; jaw dropped at $80.

13,SOUN,"Week 51 $1,173 in premium ","I will post a separate comment with a link to the detail for each option sold this week. 

After week 51 the average premium per week is $916 with a projected annual premium of $47,621.

All things considered, the portfolio is up +$69,251 (+29.81%) on the year and up $70,264 (+30.38%) over the last 365 days. This is the overall profit and loss and includes options and all other account activity.

All options sold are backed by cash, shares, or LEAPS. I do not sell on margin, nor do I sell naked options.

All options and profits stay in the account with few exceptions. This is not my full time job, although I wish it was. I still grind on a 9-5. 

Added $600 in contributions to the portfolio for the 7th week in a row. This is a 36 week streak of adding at least $500.

The portfolio is comprised of 87 unique tickers unchanged from 84 in the last week. I was in the 90s for the majority of the year. As the year is winding down, I am getting rid of some losers for tax purposes. I may pick some of them up in the new year, we shall see. These 87 tickers have a value of $229k. I also have 144 open option positions, down from 155 last week. The options have a total value of $73k. The total of the shares and options is $302k. 

I’m currently utilizing $32,350 in cash secured put collateral, down from $32,500 last week.

I sell options on a weekly basis. I prefer cash secured puts and covered calls. Sometimes I’m ahead of the indexes and sometimes I’m behind. My goal is consistency in option premium revenue.

19,SOUN,Why SoundHound AI Will Hit $30 ,"1. Addressing Concerns Right Away

Yes, the Price-to-Sales ratio is high, and technicals show it’s “overbought,” but remember, this is typical for early-stage AI companies with hyper-growth potential. The Fed’s recent rate cut to 4.25%-4.5% reduces borrowing costs, which can benefit growth stocks by improving future cash flow valuations. SoundHound AI isn’t “overvalued”—it’s priced for the massive upside AI offers.

2. Strategic Partnerships Are Game-Changers

SoundHound AI has locked in deals with major players like Hyundai, Snapdragon, and Qualcomm. These aren’t just one-off partnerships—they’re long-term collaborations that embed SoundHound AI’s voice AI into global products. Partnerships like these aren’t easy to replicate and build a moat for SoundHound AI.

3. Niche Advantage in Voice AI

Unlike broader AI plays like Palantir or Nvidia, SoundHound AI has carved out a specific niche in voice and conversational AI, which is projected to grow 25% annually. They dominate in this field, creating tools for industries like automotive, hospitality, and IoT. Voice AI is becoming a key differentiator for companies—and SoundHound AI is leading the charge.

4. Institutional Interest Is Growing

Institutional ownership is starting to rise, which is a great sign of confidence from “smart money.” Funds and institutions often wait for proof of execution before jumping in, and SoundHound AI’s recent growth metrics (40% YoY revenue) are drawing their attention. This could lead to a snowball effect of increased demand and higher prices. BlackRock, Vanguard, and NVIDIA hold significant ownership, so the volatility is a little overstated. 

TL;DR

Concerns about valuation and technicals are common for high-growth stocks, but SoundHound AI’s partnerships, niche focus, and growing institutional interest make it a strong buy in the AI space. Combine that with the tailwind of rate cuts, and $30 seems within reach.

Not financial advice, but I’m holding and optimistic. ",0,19,1734702906.0,2024-12-20T13:55:06+00:00,t3_1hik9th,stocks,"Why SoundHound AI Will Hit $30  1. Addressing Concerns Right Away

71,SOUN,Can a small-Cap insurance stock turn things around with AI?,"The U.S. stock market has seen another “tech party” over the past two days. Tesla surged 6%, while Amazon and Google also climbed higher, as if to remind us: *AI is still the future!* But as everyday retail investors, we’re not just fixated on these giants who’ve already reached “god-tier” status. I prefer looking for “underdog to powerhouse” stories, like the recent buzz around small-cap AI stocks.

When it comes to small-cap AI plays, companies like SoundHound AI and bigbear. ai have seen explosive growth. But today, I found something different: AIFU seems a potential small-cap stock set to revolutionize the AI + insurance space.

Let’s face it: insurance companies have been under fire lately. Complaint rates have doubled, and claim approvals have become notoriously difficult. U.S. media even mocked UnitedHealth’s rumored “AI claim denials,” calling AI the insurance industry’s new excuse for rejecting payouts. Everyone’s asking: *Can this industry still serve its customers properly?*

Enter AIFU, poised to change the game. Backed by the BGM Group, AIFU uses AI to optimize claims processing, design smart policies, and integrate massive data sets—essentially the *ChatGPT of insurance*. Its AI-powered platform, “DuXiaoBao,” already serves 16.8 million customers, and who knows? It might soon enter the U.S. market and make “difficult claims” a thing of the past.

The fun of small-cap investing lies in betting on the future—especially with these AI stocks. Look at C3.ai’s wild surge or SoundHound’s unstoppable rally. AIFU is currently trading just above $1, yet it boasts real business operations and clear growth potential—exactly what we’re all hunting for in a potential multi-bagger stock.

Add to that the Federal Reserve’s upcoming rate cuts, which improve liquidity for growth-oriented small caps, and companies like AIFU could be entering their golden window of opportunity.

Sure, small-cap stocks come with higher risks, but who doesn’t dream of finding their own “10x stock” in the AI boom? AIFU might not make you rich overnight, but it could very well be rewriting the rules of the insurance industry.

Want to catch the next big opportunity? Keep an eye on those “hidden gems” the market hasn’t fully discovered yet. AIFU’s story is definitely worth a closer look!

**Tl;dr:**

* At the start of the year, Nvidia crossed the $100M threshold in securities holdings, requiring it to disclose its stock portfolio for the first time, thanks in large part to the ARM IPO. Among its disclosed investments was SOUN, which sent the stock soaring, trading its second-highest daily volume ever.
* Ever the opportunist, SOUN CEO Keyvan Mohajer issued a press release a month later hyping Soundhound’s integration with Nvidia DRIVE, despite Soundhound having been an ecosystem partner for over six months already. SOUN is pushed to new highs, with its highest daily trading volume on record.
* Shortly thereafter, speculation (mine) suggests a key customer informed SOUN of their intention not to renew a licensing agreement. High on tendies but short on time, Mohajer acquires a much larger, declining legacy business—Amelia. This move masked Soundhound's declining performance while propping up top-line revenue
* Naturally, WSB and retail traders ate it up, fueling the hype cycle

# Despite misleading headlines of “record” growth last quarter, Soundhound revenue is declining

Soundhound reported “record” Q3 revenue of $25.1M, up 89% year-over-year – but failed to mention that **all** of this “growth” came from having closed its acquisition of Amelia in the quarter, and in reality, **Soundhound’s business declined \~9%.**

Nowhere does Soundhound disclose how much revenue Amelia contributed in the quarter, but pretty much any regard with half a brain can figure it out from the merger filings. Amelia generated revenue of $45M in the first half of 2024, down 4% year-over-year (yes, the company they acquired ***is also declining***). Assuming the same negative growth rate in the second half, you get \~$44.7M. 

[Amelia Revenue](https://preview.redd.it/o6mvsq4dav5e1.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=53f34074638912ededf539313815c93fb003f2b7)

We don’t have quarterly results for Amelia; however, we can observe that there isn’t any seasonality between the first and second half of 2023. This might seem odd if you’re familiar with SaaS, because there tends to be seasonality in Q4, but **Amelia is actually not a SaaS business**, despite best efforts to hide that fact. It sells on premise software licenses, and most of its revenue comes from maintenance services and professional services. Therefore, it’s fair to assume that revenue is recognized evenly over the quarters, so we can estimate Q3 2024 revenue for Amelia to be \~$22M (50% \* $44.7M). 

Since the acquisition closed in the middle of the quarter (8/8/2024), Soundhound was able to recognize \~58% of Amelia’s Q3 revenue and included this in its Q3 results. Of the $22M that Amelia generated in Q3, **$13M (58% \* $22M) of that was recognized by Soundhound as revenue generated by Amelia after 8/8/2024.** 

Backing this out of Soundhound’s “record” Q3 revenue, we can see that **the organic Soundhound business generated just \~$12M, declining \~9% year-over-year.**

[Soundhound Q3 Growth](https://preview.redd.it/yu7yewcf5v5e1.png?width=287&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a4772913c6de5115fd73ae89163d65190b96187)

Honestly, this is so basic and wrong that I can’t believe the Company had the balls to run with this headline. The stock isn’t widely covered, but not a single analyst brought it up on the earnings call or in their subsequent reports. Obviously it’s wrong to compare results that include revenue from an acquisition to a prior quarter that doesn’t - you’re not comparing the same company between periods. The reason it’s wrong is because in this case, **revenue for** **both** **Amelia AND Soundhound declined in the quarter, yet presented this way it appears that the combined business actually grew!** 

Even worse, Q4 guidance implies organic revenue **will decline by a staggering 27% YoY**. This isn’t a growth story; it’s a shrinking one, cleverly obscured by acquisition accounting.

[Soundhound Q4 guidance](https://preview.redd.it/tdflfz1j5v5e1.png?width=296&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c27f8baa8ce37100bf9ab74aad5af901f0ffef70)

When I first saw these numbers, I thought something must be wrong with my math. Software companies don’t just decline after periods of rapid growth, they have recurring revenue that you can see declining way before it happens. But Soundhound is not a subscription software business at all - **95% of their revenue comes from product royalties that depend on the in-period sales of physical products like cars, smart speakers, and other devices.** 

[Soundhound revenue by type](https://preview.redd.it/ruxcyb0s5v5e1.png?width=651&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f2a5ffd325ab2615d2c0831f31a879b92cebb19)

This is not an isolated incident, but rather a pattern of misleading and selective disclosure by the company. 

# Amelia: A legacy boomer-tech business that now represents 2/3rds of Soundhound's revenue

Amelia, the acquisition that accounts for this “growth,” is a declining, legacy business. Founded in 1998 as IPSoft, Amelia’s has always specialized in automating back-office stuff with rudimentary chatbots. Amelia only recently began offering customer-facing chatbots, which it now claims to be leading AI Agents despite not being built on a modern LLM stack. 

Don’t take my word for it, you can see for yourself just how leading Amelia’s “conversational AI” is. Amelia counts American Heritage Credit Union as a proud customer, and you can go to their [website](https://www.americanheritagecu.org/), click Live Chat, and you’ll be taken to a dialogue box where you can chat with an Amelia powered agent - it even proudly displays the Amelia logo in the bottom right. Here’s how my conversation went: 

[Amelia Chat](https://preview.redd.it/r5ujc4en6v5e1.png?width=809&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb43d5aff2e3d3fb7da62ce343c93c9c2574cd12)

Nothing about this interaction was helpful, and it couldn’t answer basic questions like “What are some things you can help me with?”. **This is not AI, this is the same old, legacy chatbots powered by rudimentary decision trees that have been the standard for decades.** 

Contrast this experience with one powered by a truly leading AI Agent, Sierra. Sierra counts OluKai, a footwear retailer, as a customer, and you can chat with their AI Agent by going to the OluKai [website ](https://olukai.com/pages/contact)and clicking “Contact Us”. Here’s how my conversation went: 

[Sierra chat](https://preview.redd.it/b7txd7lq6v5e1.png?width=559&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=088bfe0c601b8be9afd42b1acb3d6c2ecd3430e6)

The difference is night and day. The Sierra-powered agent is actually inferring and reasoning like a human agent would. And Sierra isn’t the only well funded competitor automating customer service operations with AI, there’s also Salesforce, Microsoft, Kore.ai, Yellow.ai, Parloa, and many others. 

None of this should be controversial or surprising - Amelia is boomer tech founded in the 90s, with loads of technical debt and miscalculated moves compounded over 25 years. 

But, let’s suppose Amelia truly were a leading, next generation conversational AI company and has been for decades. If that were the case, **why would revenue be declining despite selling into an environment where CEOs and CIOs are hyper-focused on how they can leverage Generative AI in their customer service operations?** That would be like losing money as a crypto trader in 2024 - the problem might be you. 

None of this would be too concerning for Soundhound if it wasn’t for the materiality of the acquisition and its size relative to Soundhound. Amelia is a much shittier business than Soundhound, but it’s also \~2x its size from a financial perspective. Soundhound’s financials will now be driven by the results of Amelia, and so too will the stock price. Here’s the side-by-side combined view of the income statement that was filed as part of the merger:

https://preview.redd.it/icz23hx07v5e1.png?width=1387&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95b6f256e0975d1efcbd30088077176ed268f551

In 2023, Soundhound generated revenue of \~$46M, compared to Amelia which generated $93M. Going forward, Amelia will represent the majority of Soundhound’s revenue, good or bad. And I think it’s bad, because this is low quality, low margin revenue. **Amelia’s cost of revenue was $65.7M, leaving gross profit of $27.6M, for a whopping gross margin of 30%!** 

Seriously, do you know of any software company with 30% gross margins? YETI makes common household items out of metal and has better margins than this. The reason Amelia’s margins are so terrible is because **they don’t sell very much software**, despite their best efforts to hide that fact. Here’s the revenue composition that was disclosed in the merger filings: 

[Amelia revenue by type](https://preview.redd.it/hfmpse697v5e1.png?width=770&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8347bb1b070988f4e2b28a5fc51760fa07978b9c)

The vast majority of revenue came from “Subscription”, which, according to the company, includes SaaS revenue but also ongoing support and maintenance service revenue. **The reason they’re not breaking out SaaS revenue separately is because it would be immaterial and embarrassing to report,** so they’ve combined it with services and called the whole thing “Subscription”. 

Obviously these are not the same. SaaS and Licenses command 80%+ gross margins - very different from Amelia’s gross margin of 30%. 

# Soundhound's business model is fundamentally flawed and overexposed to risk

Soundhound isn’t a SaaS company. 95% of its revenue comes from product royalties, heavily dependent on the sales of physical goods like cars and smart speakers. This is not a recurring software model; their revenue is highly susceptible to fluctuations from the sales of its own customers. 

Adding to the problem is customer concentration: **62% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from just two automotive customers**, likely Hyundai and Kia. If either customer scales back purchases, Soundhound’s revenue will crater.

https://preview.redd.it/lwhmohjk7v5e1.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=684e25adcd9bcb7a1aa1d565549e32196a4c429e

Worse, only 15% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from US customers. Since most of Soundhound’s revenue comes from product royalties, and most of these royalties come from customers located outside the US, **Soundhound is exposed to US tariff and trade policy that could negatively impact the sales of its foreign customers.**

# The NVIDIA hype is an overblown fantasy perpetuated by Soundhound's CEO

If you’ve been riding the SOUN hype train, you’re probably thinking: “But what about Nvidia!” And sure, Nvidia’s name being linked to Soundhound gave this stock rocket fuel. But here’s the cold, hard truth: this “partnership” is anything but strategic and it's more smoke than substance.

Yes, Nvidia owns a small stake in Soundhound – just 1.7M common shares – but this is not a new development. Nvidia first invested in Soundhound back in 2017 as part of a [private $75M venture round](https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/31/soundhound-raises-75m-to-bring-its-voice-enabled-ai-everywhere/), long before the stock ever traded publicly. This investment was disclosed again during Soundhound’s [2021 de-SPAC process](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1840856/000121390021059758/ea150505ex99-2_archimedes.htm), yet retail investors and media only took notice when [Nvidia filed its first-ever 13-F](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581024000021/xslForm13F_X02/information_table.xml) report in February 2024, disclosing its SOUN holdings. The market collectively lost its mind, sending SOUN up 67% in a single day.

https://preview.redd.it/3o6rpulq7v5e1.png?width=1904&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=224e650fcb4281072d203301362e0f74fdb2a786

Prior to this, the **one and only time** NVIDIA was ever mentioned in any of Soundhound’s earnings transcripts was in Q2 2023, when CEO Keyvan Mohajer rattled off a list 9 “strategic” investors, NVIDIA among them:

https://preview.redd.it/0y6gvezt7v5e1.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=379365fe89c9d7410816d3ea0dc662c10d27180e

Just one month after the NVIDIA 13-F filing, in an effort to capitalize on the hype, Soundhound issued a [press release](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240318067099/en/) about its integration with Nvidia’s DRIVE platform for in-vehicle voice assistants. During its next earnings call, **Kevyon mentions NVIDIA six times**, describing the “collaboration” as a “very big milestone” for in-vehicle generative AI. While Kevyon positioned the “partnership” as new, **Soundhound has been an NVIDIA DRIVE partner since at least October 2023** based on a trip to the Wayback machine

[NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Oct 2023](https://preview.redd.it/4toe71qx7v5e1.png?width=1350&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a596eeddf44e08e19aaf7dd7c321a3d886ad4ea1)

But let’s examine the facts. [Nvidia’s DRIVE platform](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/self-driving-cars/partners/) is an end-to-end development platform for autonomous vehicles, designed to attract a broad ecosystem of partners. It’s not an exclusive club. Nvidia’s DRIVE Partner Ecosystem website lists over 100 partners, **including Soundhound’s closest competitor** (Ironically I'll be banned for mentioning its ticker). Nvidia even published a [blog post](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/cerence-generative-ai-in-car-experience/) showcasing its offerings on the DRIVE platform – something it hasn’t done for Soundhound. **If this “partnership” were truly transformative, wouldn’t Nvidia at least acknowledge Soundhound publicly?**

[NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Current \(Cerence\)](https://preview.redd.it/c0iczsy28v5e1.png?width=1415&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63a889071b541ebc556505e51c7e2a5b0ec9e2ec)

The reality is, Soundhound’s integration with DRIVE is one of many among hundreds of partners. This isn’t a deep, strategic relationship – it’s a basic vendor integration, the kind that doesn’t move the needle for Nvidia. **Soundhound hyped it up because they knew the name recognition alone would excite retail investors, but the lack of reciprocation from Nvidia tells a different story.**

This isn’t a transformative partnership; it’s an opportunistic narrative crafted to milk the Nvidia association for all it’s worth. Don’t fall for the hype.

# Soundhound has obfuscated the true price it paid for Amelia, which is much higher than headline reports of $80M (as much as 3x higher)

In its [press release](https://www.soundhound.com/newsroom/press-releases/soundhound-ai-acquires-amelia-significantly-expanding-its-scale-and-reach-in-conversational-ai-across-new-verticals-and-hundreds-of-enterprise-brands/) announcing the acquisition, Soundhound characterized the purchase price as “$80 million in cash and equity, with partial payment and assumption of Amelia’s debt, as well as future earnout potential…”

While there’s nothing wrong with this statement, it’s unusual that the number they decided to disclose ($80M) wasn’t the full transaction price. Now, you may not believe this is misleading, but it literally misled Techcrunch, which wrote up a story on the acquisition, announcing it as an $80M deal. 

https://preview.redd.it/zv6qjd798v5e1.png?width=646&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1b556d4a600df16dfc48a0a38d59c79ce40bf64

The details can be found in the [stock purchase agreement](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/121390024066351/2?cik=1840856), but here’s the summary: After accounting for the $80M upfront payment, $70M in paid-down debt, $39.7M in assumed debt, $8.6M in transaction expenses, and up to $90M in equity earnouts, the total acquisition cost could hit $288M (and much higher at these current prices)

This price tag is staggering for a declining business with abysmal gross margins. Soundhound’s selective disclosure of Amelia’s cost highlights a troubling pattern: management glosses over bad news and amplifies good news, regardless of the facts.

# Implied valuation for Soundhound is astronomical, even by WSB standards

I won’t spend much time on this topic, because honestly, who cares? Prices go up and down all the time. But there’s an important nuance here, and it has to do with how Amelia is valued with the rest of Soundhound

Soundhound currently trades at an enterprise value of $5.4 billion, or 32.8x forward revenue. But most of this revenue comes from Amelia, and $1 from Amelia is worth much less than $1 from Soundhound (that’s how Soundhound was able to acquire a business with much more revenue than itself). 

We don’t know what Amelia is worth today, but we can approximate it as the maximum amount Soundhound could end up paying for it ($288M). After all, that’s what Soundhound just paid for the asset in August. 

With this information we can back into the implied value of the core Soundhound business, which is $5.1 billion at a revenue multiple of 68x.

For comparison, Palantir only trades at a lofty 2025 revenue multiple of 49x. But at least with Palantir, you’re getting a differentiated business, with competitive moats and deep ties to the incoming administration that happens to be Palantir’s biggest customer. With Soundhound, you’re getting boomer-tech that’s trying to go head to head with some the best funded, most talented competitors on the planet.

If you’ve been printing tendies off this 600% rocket, congrats – I genuinely mean that (but also, fuck you). But here’s the thing: stocks don’t just go up forever, and Soundhound’s hype train has more red flags than a Chinese parade. The good news? You can still make money – big money – by embracing your inner gay bear and shorting this house of cards for all the reasons I’m about to tell you.

**Tl;dr:**

* At the start of the year, Nvidia crossed the $100M threshold in securities holdings, requiring it to disclose its stock portfolio for the first time, thanks in large part to the ARM IPO. Among its disclosed investments was SOUN, which sent the stock soaring, trading its second-highest daily volume ever.
* Ever the opportunist, SOUN CEO Keyvan Mohajer issued a press release a month later hyping Soundhound’s integration with Nvidia DRIVE, despite Soundhound having been an ecosystem partner for over six months already. SOUN is pushed to new highs, with its highest daily trading volume on record.
* Shortly thereafter, speculation (mine) suggests a key customer informed SOUN of their intention not to renew a licensing agreement. High on tendies but short on time, Mohajer acquires a much larger, declining legacy business—Amelia. This move masked Soundhound's declining performance while propping up top-line revenue
* Naturally, WSB and retail traders ate it up, fueling the hype cycle

# Despite misleading headlines of “record” growth last quarter, Soundhound revenue is declining

Soundhound reported “record” Q3 revenue of $25.1M, up 89% year-over-year – but failed to mention that **all** of this “growth” came from having closed its acquisition of Amelia in the quarter, and in reality, **Soundhound’s business declined \~9%.**

Nowhere does Soundhound disclose how much revenue Amelia contributed in the quarter, but pretty much any regard with half a brain can figure it out from the merger filings. Amelia generated revenue of $45M in the first half of 2024, down 4% year-over-year (yes, the company they acquired ***is also declining***). Assuming the same negative growth rate in the second half, you get \~$44.7M. 

[Amelia Revenue](https://preview.redd.it/o6mvsq4dav5e1.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=53f34074638912ededf539313815c93fb003f2b7)

We don’t have quarterly results for Amelia; however, we can observe that there isn’t any seasonality between the first and second half of 2023. This might seem odd if you’re familiar with SaaS, because there tends to be seasonality in Q4, but **Amelia is actually not a SaaS business**, despite best efforts to hide that fact. It sells on premise software licenses, and most of its revenue comes from maintenance services and professional services. Therefore, it’s fair to assume that revenue is recognized evenly over the quarters, so we can estimate Q3 2024 revenue for Amelia to be \~$22M (50% \* $44.7M). 

Since the acquisition closed in the middle of the quarter (8/8/2024), Soundhound was able to recognize \~58% of Amelia’s Q3 revenue and included this in its Q3 results. Of the $22M that Amelia generated in Q3, **$13M (58% \* $22M) of that was recognized by Soundhound as revenue generated by Amelia after 8/8/2024.** 

Backing this out of Soundhound’s “record” Q3 revenue, we can see that **the organic Soundhound business generated just \~$12M, declining \~9% year-over-year.**

[Soundhound Q3 Growth](https://preview.redd.it/yu7yewcf5v5e1.png?width=287&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a4772913c6de5115fd73ae89163d65190b96187)

Honestly, this is so basic and wrong that I can’t believe the Company had the balls to run with this headline. The stock isn’t widely covered, but not a single analyst brought it up on the earnings call or in their subsequent reports. Obviously it’s wrong to compare results that include revenue from an acquisition to a prior quarter that doesn’t - you’re not comparing the same company between periods. The reason it’s wrong is because in this case, **revenue for** **both** **Amelia AND Soundhound declined in the quarter, yet presented this way it appears that the combined business actually grew!** 

Even worse, Q4 guidance implies organic revenue **will decline by a staggering 27% YoY**. This isn’t a growth story; it’s a shrinking one, cleverly obscured by acquisition accounting.

[Soundhound Q4 guidance](https://preview.redd.it/tdflfz1j5v5e1.png?width=296&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c27f8baa8ce37100bf9ab74aad5af901f0ffef70)

When I first saw these numbers, I thought something must be wrong with my math. Software companies don’t just decline after periods of rapid growth, they have recurring revenue that you can see declining way before it happens. But Soundhound is not a subscription software business at all - **95% of their revenue comes from product royalties that depend on the in-period sales of physical products like cars, smart speakers, and other devices.** 

[Soundhound revenue by type](https://preview.redd.it/ruxcyb0s5v5e1.png?width=651&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f2a5ffd325ab2615d2c0831f31a879b92cebb19)

This is not an isolated incident, but rather a pattern of misleading and selective disclosure by the company. 

# Amelia: A legacy boomer-tech business that now represents 2/3rds of Soundhound's revenue

Amelia, the acquisition that accounts for this “growth,” is a declining, legacy business. Founded in 1998 as IPSoft, Amelia’s has always specialized in automating back-office stuff with rudimentary chatbots. Amelia only recently began offering customer-facing chatbots, which it now claims to be leading AI Agents despite not being built on a modern LLM stack. 

Don’t take my word for it, you can see for yourself just how leading Amelia’s “conversational AI” is. Amelia counts American Heritage Credit Union as a proud customer, and you can go to their [website](https://www.americanheritagecu.org/), click Live Chat, and you’ll be taken to a dialogue box where you can chat with an Amelia powered agent - it even proudly displays the Amelia logo in the bottom right.

The reality is, Soundhound’s integration with DRIVE is one of many among hundreds of partners. This isn’t a deep, strategic relationship – it’s a basic vendor integration, the kind that doesn’t move the needle for Nvidia. **Soundhound hyped it up because they knew the name recognition alone would excite retail investors, but the lack of reciprocation from Nvidia tells a different story.**

This isn’t a transformative partnership; it’s an opportunistic narrative crafted to milk the Nvidia association for all it’s worth. Don’t fall for the hype.

# Soundhound has obfuscated the true price it paid for Amelia, which is much higher than headline reports of $80M (as much as 3x higher)

In its [press release](https://www.soundhound.com/newsroom/press-releases/soundhound-ai-acquires-amelia-significantly-expanding-its-scale-and-reach-in-conversational-ai-across-new-verticals-and-hundreds-of-enterprise-brands/) announcing the acquisition, Soundhound characterized the purchase price as “$80 million in cash and equity, with partial payment and assumption of Amelia’s debt, as well as future earnout potential…”

While there’s nothing wrong with this statement, it’s unusual that the number they decided to disclose ($80M) wasn’t the full transaction price. Now, you may not believe this is misleading, but it literally misled Techcrunch, which wrote up a story on the acquisition, announcing it as an $80M deal. 

https://preview.redd.it/zv6qjd798v5e1.png?width=646&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1b556d4a600df16dfc48a0a38d59c79ce40bf64

The details can be found in the [stock purchase agreement](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/121390024066351/2?cik=1840856), but here’s the summary: After accounting for the $80M upfront payment, $70M in paid-down debt, $39.7M in assumed debt, $8.6M in transaction expenses, and up to $90M in equity earnouts, the total acquisition cost could hit $288M (and much higher at these current prices)

This price tag is staggering for a declining business with abysmal gross margins. Soundhound’s selective disclosure of Amelia’s cost highlights a troubling pattern: management glosses over bad news and amplifies good news, regardless of the facts.

# Implied valuation for Soundhound is astronomical, even by WSB standards

I won’t spend much time on this topic, because honestly, who cares? Prices go up and down all the time. But there’s an important nuance here, and it has to do with how Amelia is valued with the rest of Soundhound

Soundhound currently trades at an enterprise value of $5.4 billion, or 32.8x forward revenue. But most of this revenue comes from Amelia, and $1 from Amelia is worth much less than $1 from Soundhound (that’s how Soundhound was able to acquire a business with much more revenue than itself). 

We don’t know what Amelia is worth today, but we can approximate it as the maximum amount Soundhound could end up paying for it ($288M). After all, that’s what Soundhound just paid for the asset in August. 

With this information we can back into the implied value of the core Soundhound business, which is $5.1 billion at a revenue multiple of 68x.

For comparison, Palantir only trades at a lofty 2025 revenue multiple of 49x. But at least with Palantir, you’re getting a differentiated business, with competitive moats and deep ties to the incoming administration that happens to be Palantir’s biggest customer. With Soundhound, you’re getting boomer-tech that’s trying to go head to head with some the best funded, most talented competitors on the planet.

17,SOUN,3 Months of Gains! Let's go!,"Almost 6 months ago, I mutually agreed to part ways with my company. I was President of a Construction Company that was private equity backed and based in Milwaukee. A fun opportunity, and different environment compared to being a serial entrepreneur. Had the opportunity to service hundreds of customers, and build a brand at the expense of someone else! Definitely a cool chapter of my life. Unfortunately, my old man was diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer on January 1, 2024 (Happy new year, I guess right?). He currently lives in India, and I split time between Milwaukee and Philadelphia. Without getting into the weeds, I resigned and relocated to India and travel back and forth every 3 months for a couple of weeks.

I decided over the summer, that I would begin full time trading. I have been passively investing in the market for the past 10 years, more active since the beginning of the pandemic. I have taught friends, made and then lost and then recovered and made again, I've been in and out of the market, but I decided to apply my approach at scale.

As an investor, I'm a believer in fundamentals, but also a big value investor. Being a serial entrepreneur and having scaled a variety of businesses in global markets, I have found that I have a deep understanding of valuation and value-prospects, I believe I have a similar approach and understanding to various MMs, and have used that approach intertwined with technical to read the market. My goal was to first generate enough monthly income to cover all liabilities I have on the books, approx. 7-8k per month in fixed expenses. I have multiple accounts where I trade options exclusively, but I decided I would set up a new account purely for trading of equities only.

I told my Old Man there were 251 trading days in a typical year, if I could average 1% per day, I would be able to generate 251% return. LOL... ambitious I know. I did a little math, looked at my trading history, and formulated a pricing strategy for entry and exit in various ticker symbols where I have done a lot of due diligence. It's funny...I found there are some names that I can never win on, and there are some names, that I can just continue to win with (all mental I know...) but I know the price levels realy well. Not every trade is a win, and you'll see that - but I use my losses as ticket symbols to attack on swing trades and recover my losses over the course of the upcoming year.

I created an account in Robinhood with $36,000 opening balance on September 3rd, 2024. I average about $13,000 in margin. I transfer any profits when I close a position and the equity balance is greater than $36,000.

Here are my results!

I completed the first 3 months, as of today, with a 92.26% return (Robinhood's percentages are all messed up because it's counts the withdrawals as capital reduction versus capital gains). I hope I can keep this up going forward! Wish me luck, regards.

Here are my results!

I completed the first 3 months, as of today, with a 92.26% return (Robinhood's percentages are all messed up because it's counts the withdrawals as capital reduction versus capital gains). I hope I can keep this up going forward! Wish me luck, regards.

 

Update: Added images! Don't know why they didn't post the first time.

**2. Innodata Inc. (NASDAQ: INOD)**

Innodata focuses on data engineering and AI-enabled platforms that streamline operations across industries such as healthcare, finance, and government. Its customizable AI solutions, including data management and PR-focused tools, give it a competitive edge.

**3.  AIX Inc. (NASDAQ: AIFU)**

AIX Inc. (ticker: AIFU) is a micro-cap company with a market capitalization of approximately $78 million, primarily focused on AI-driven automation solutions for various industries. After a significant market cap decline of over 80% year-on-year in 2024, the company is currently in a transitional phase, aiming to reposition itself for growth.

**Key Financial Metrics:**

Profitability:

● Over the year of 2023, AIX reported revenue of $325 million and net income of $20.4 million, translating to earnings per share (EPS) of $0.38.

● Its gross margin of 37.26% and net margin of 6.28% demonstrate robust cost control and operational efficiency.

Balance Sheet:

● AIX boasts $106 million in cash and $28.3 million in debt, resulting in a net cash position of around $77.7 million.

● With a debt-to-equity ratio of just 0.09, the company operates with minimal leverage and significant financial stability.

Valuation:

● The stock’s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 3.62, considerably lower than the industry average of 27.91, indicating that it may be undervalued.

● Its price-to-book (P/B) ratio stands at 0.26, suggesting the stock is trading at a significant discount relative to its book value of $5.38 per share.

AIX is perceived as trading below intrinsic value, with a valuation model estimating its fair price at $3.53 per share. This discrepancy presents a potential arbitrage opportunity for value investors. Additionally, AI technology remains a major market trend, and AIX’s focus on R&amp;D and process optimization could position it for future revenue and profit growth.



**Investment Considerations:**

**Overall, the three AI stocks presents a compelling case as an undervalued small-cap stock with significant potential in the AI space.**

SoundHound AI (SOUN) is a strong play in the voice AI space, backed by its innovative technology and expanding partnerships. Meanwhile, Innodata (INOD) provides diversified exposure to AI-driven data solutions, demonstrating robust revenue growth despite facing scrutiny from critics. AIX Inc. (AIFU) adds another layer of potential with its AI-driven automation solutions targeting industrial efficiency.

McDonald’s is ramping its AI efforts back up and all signs point to SoundHound AI as their next major partner. Their recent job posting for a Director of AI Engineering focuses on integrating Generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs) into existing systems, rather than building proprietary solutions from scratch. This aligns perfectly with SoundHound’s expertise in conversational AI and their dominance in the foodservice sector. Notably, McDonald’s previously ended its AI collaboration with IBM, leaving room for a more specialized partner to enhance its drive-thru, kiosk, and mobile ordering systems.

Adding fuel to the speculation, SoundHound recently announced on their earnings call that they’ve secured a major new client in the restaurant industry—one they are not yet able to name and negotiating with others. Given McDonald’s history of partnering with established tech leaders like Dynamic Yield and the timing of this hiring, it’s hard not to connect the dots. If this is indeed a McDonald’s x SoundHound collaboration, it could mark a transformative leap forward in customer experience with cutting-edge conversational AI.

I had orders in to close an in the money debit spread and also a  put order at $5.5 Nov 15 in case there was an earnings disappointment (I'm long SOUN at about $4.90}, but couldn't pull the trigger before market close. Damn.

6,SOUN,Partnership with MCSU Health and why it matters. ,"August 28th SH partnered with MCSU Health. This was part of last quarter ending Sept 30th. This was not “previously anticipated” and could be the factor that beats expectations on Nov 12th as the revenue from MCSU was not accounted for in estimates.

“A deal with MUSC Health, a top South Carolina hospital, could boost SoundHound's earnings above expectations next quarter. The organization brought in over $8 billion in gross patient revenue in fiscal 2023. Given its massive size, SoundHound could generate significant revenue from the deal announced on Aug. 28 in the quarter ending Sept. 30. This was not previously anticipated.”

19,SOUN,Worth It to Sell Covered Calls on LEAPS?,"Covered calls feels like have only ever cost me money, even opening spreads I'd imagine has cost me more than the times it's helped reduce overall costs/risk. Unless close to expiration short legs can even work against, the correct move takes place but can only close for 25% of the max profit early-on.

I have LEAPS on HIMS, HOOD, S, ADMA, RKLB, CLOV, SOFI, SOUN, GRAB, LUNR to give an idea. Few of these companies over the next two years will build deep intrinsic value but some these high beta companies can move too fast if sell CC's. Am already overran on HOOD/HIMS waiting to roll again. Opening CC on day-of earning's to sell high IV could be a costly mistake?

In IRA, cannot sell CC's on LEAPS or open spreads basically. In brokerage, selling CC's on the other half of LEAPS. Is it worth it to generate income or is the potential to be overrun too great, which is already happening.

15,SOUN,SOUN (SoundHound AI) is insanely overvalued ,"Company has a $1.74B market cap on only ~$54M of annualized revenue…an insane ~32x revenue multiple.

On top of that last quarter EBITDA margin is -158%…down 37% from same quarter last year.

Now if SOUN was some sort of revolutionary category defining company…maybe I could get on board. But it’s just mostly a customer service/customer experience tool…not even particularly differentiated at that. Plenty of competition in the AI sound and voice recognition space.

Now granted it’s growing much faster than your typical public SaaS company at ~54% YoY…but that’s easy when revenue is only around $50M. No way that growth rate is sustainable for this business. 

The 8-12x revenue multiple range is where SOUN market cap should be right now…I have a feeling we’ll see it there sometime not too far off in the future.

- shorted $62k worth of NVDA, AMD, and QQQ Aug 1, then Japan announced some scary nothing burger and I made $45k profit. Combo of puts and shares. This lead to the recent breakout

20,SOUN,Question about insider acquisition of shares on non market open.,"So I found this and had some questions and am hoping that someone here is more intelligent than I am and can help me out. 

I looked up what non open market acquisitions are and have a high level understanding, correct me if I’m wrong; but it means these shares were exercised options at the corporate ceo type levels off the public market. Could be a bonus package, or discount offerings to employees, etc.

My real question is to understand how of all these acquisitions they all cost $0.00. How can they get these shares for nothing. I’m not even sure I’m wording the question right, but wouldn’t there have to be a price of some kind attached to any of these acquisitions? Can anyone explain to me what this even means? Did I botch the google research on non market open? I really couldn’t find anything relating these in with a $0.00 price tag.

**EDIT: Trump stated that there will be no changes in political strategy. Got out of VXX at flat.**

* [**LUMN**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=LUMN&amp;p=d) - Watching $8 level for today, recently reported earnings. Stock has been stronger than expected despite pullback.
* [**LLY**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=LLY&amp;p=d) - Reported blowout earnings- raised guidance from $13.50-$14 to $16-16.60 for 2025. EPS of $3.92 vs $2.60. Revenue of $11.3B vs $9.92. Watching how this will trade at the open but will be light because stock is so high priced.

34,SOUN,What caused the 3am $12 spike for Nvidia?,"I’ve been studying wave theory and the market for a while.  This includes AH and PM data.

Nvidia showed some weakness this week.  The indicators I use for 4 hour candles, CCI, Stochastic, SMI all showed Ncvida should decline.  The stock closed at $887 thursday.

Nvidia conveniently spikes $12 or 1.2% to $903 at 3am.  This healthy dose of hopium changed all the indications, EMAS, MACD and caused Nvidia to have another green day.  The spike at 3am was greater than the entire movement of Nvidia for the entire trading session.

What’s behind these massive PM movements that can completely change the course of a stock?

65,SOUN,Earning and other plays for next week,"I have bought a lot of calls for earnings next week. It seems the market has again started to go back on its bull run and seems like a good time to make some profit. There are a lot of earnings next week, and my positions are as follow:

SAVE - 20x 5/10 3.5c@0.39(Earnings 5/6 premarket)
HIMS - 10x 5/10 12.5c@0.8, 10x 5/10 13.5c@0.5 (Earnings 5/6 AH)
PLTR - 5x 5/10 22.5c@1.8 (Earning 5/6 AH)
HOOD - 5x 5/10 17c@1.37, 5x 5/10 17.5c@0.9 (Earnings 5/8 AH)

Actually wondering if I should roll over my HOOD calls to 8/16 20c, and my PLTR calls to 7/19 24c (in case stock doesnt go tits up after earnings and my calls dont gain much or even lose money)

Also have ARM strangle, SOUN calls, MCHP calls and U calls in my watchlist, might add them as well for earnings.

Other calls:
ALCC - 10x 5/17 12.5c@2.9 (Sam Altman my GOAT, hoping for a big pop after the merger announcement)
IBRX - 10x 6/21 10c@1.42 (Good squeeze potential, great fundamentals and deals, earnings also coming up on 5/9)
RILY - 10x 5/17 35c@2.2 (Again, great squeeze potential and earnings coming up 5/14 will be interesting how it plays out)

What do you guys think, will these calls print? What are your guys positions for next week?

66,SOUN,Call Credit Spreads 3 Month Update. $58k - $204k,"

Well, there it is, A lot of people DMd me asking for updates after my DD post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bgg3f3/my_almost_invincible_call_credit_spread_strategy/) where I went over my strategy to sell far OTM call credit spreads on stocks reporting earnings that week. Since today is the 3-month anniversary of the day I started, here is an update/story.

It started many months ago, Setptember to be exact, when I was selling cash secured puts on average stocks like META, MSFT, etc.. then everything changed in December when I decided to sell puts on AMC. AMC tanked and my puts got assigned, so I doubled down and it kept falling. Before I knew it, I was leveraged to the tits. Full send, max margin in AMC shares which you can see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18wr5vz/the_first_and_probably_last_green_ytd_chart_i/) - a photo of my portfolio is in the comments. Unfortunately, AMC continued to go down.

Around January 13th, I said fuck it. I sold EVERYTHING at a huge loss. I settled on keeping $58k and went full send into NFLX Put credit spreads barely out of the money. NFLX rose on earnings and the strategy was born.

Eventually, I did more research. I made the spreadsheet you see in my DD post and have since updated it further. Also, I almost exclusively sell deep otm call credit spreads now because I have found that they give me better risk to reward. Since January 13th, and Just to name a few, I've yeeted my whole net worth into selling OTM weekly Call Credit Spreads on NFLX, LULU, ULTA, COST, DG, MSTR, SMCI, BIDU, SOUN, DJT, and JPM. That's what I can remember right now at least.

I haven't kept track of my total profit per week since I started, but here is the last 4 weeks (I know I'm missing some fees in my weekly ending amounts).

67,SOUN,Heroes of WSB,"I'd like to express my gratitude to the individuals who generously dedicate their time to sharing valuable due diligence (DD) posts on this forum. The level of commitment and effort invested in providing insights to benefit countless individuals does not receive the recognition it deserves. In just a month, I've made half my yearly income since I've begun options trading. While I've encountered my fair share of setbacks along the way, the guidance provided by these DDs (and comments) has empowered me to make more informed decisions and recover. It's truly remarkable to live in an era where an average Joe like myself can work an extra full-time job and profit from the markets. The majority of us would not have been able to do this 5-10 years ago on our own. Thank you, gentlemen, for your invaluable contributions!

The level of commitment and effort invested in providing insights to benefit countless individuals does not receive the recognition it deserves. In just a month, I've made half my yearly income since I've begun options trading. While I've encountered my fair share of setbacks along the way, the guidance provided by these DDs (and comments) has empowered me to make more informed decisions and recover. It's truly remarkable to live in an era where an average Joe like myself can work an extra full-time job and profit from the markets. The majority of us would not have been able to do this 5-10 years ago on our own. Thank you, gentlemen, for your invaluable contributions!

68,SOUN,SOUN is dogshit on a stick,"SOUN is worth less than $1.  Here's why:

\- SOUN made $46mm in annual revenue in 2023.  Current market cap is $1.9 billion.  That 42 times sales. This is 1999-2000 dot-com bubble level stupidity.  Even when the stock gets to $1/share, the market cap would be around 7 times sales, which is still ridiculously high for this garbage.

\- SOUN has never made a profit.  Again, for all the regards: this company loses money every quarter and every year and always has.

\- Raised $140 million in its 2021 IPO and burned $148 million of cash in 2022 and 2023

How does SOUN generate cash to pay its CEO and its employees?  By issuing equity, diluting shareholders.  

\- Current cash on hand (as of 12/31/23) was $95 million.  SOUN burns approximately $15-$20 million of cash each quarter (using Cash Flow from Operations as a proxy for cash burn).  As of today (3/26/24), that means SOUN probably has around $75 million of cash.  Mininum cash for a garbage heap like this company is $25-$50 million.  That means the company will need to raise cash again between today and one quarter from today.  That means on some random day in the next 3 months, we will get a press release saying they're issuing equity and all your shares are automatically worth less (and the stock will probably drop 5-15% that day alone).

\- SOUN fired its last financial auditor UHY in April 2022 because it said multiple times that SOUN had issues as ""of a matter for going conern"" ([https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1840856/000121390022023274/ea159193-8k\_soundhound.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1840856/000121390022023274/ea159193-8k_soundhound.htm)) which is a polite way to say that SOUN is a dogshit company on a stick.  Then SOUN hired Armanino LLP as auditor which resigned in July 2023 and was replaced by PWC.  Guess what PWC had to say?? 

\- PWC wrote in SOUN's 2023 10'K: “In our opinion, the Company did not maintain, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023.”  So basically, you can't trust the financial statements.  

\- SOUN missed estimates for 4Q23 revenue and 4Q23 earnings loss.

\- SOUN competes against Alexa, Siri, and Google's Assistant.  Really?  These titans will squash SOUN like a cockroach

\- SOUN's CEO is selling shares.  He sold at least 658,000 shares in several batches after the stock starting pumping in February 2024

\- ""bUT NVIDIA iNVestED in SOUn!!""  Yes, Nvidia filed a 13F with the SEC on 2/14/23 that said it did in fact have an investment in SOUN.  However, what the financial press hides from retail is that Nvidia made this investment 7 years ago and it invested only $3.7 million!!  It was not a new investment, and Nvidia has not invested anything more into SOUN in the last 7 years since the initial investment.

TLDR: SOUN is a pile of garbage riding the AI frenzy. This is mostly a pump and dump currently in the dumping phase.  Look at the 1-6 month charts similar pump and dump schemese [C3.AI](https://C3.AI) and BBAI to see what is going to happen with SOUN.  of Even the CEO is using retail SOUN buyers as exit liquidity.

18,SOUN,SoundHound AI DD: THE MOAT OF RESTUARANT AI," **My SoundHound AI DD**

 

**Relationship with Nvidia:**  
Yes, we all know Nvidia has 1,730,883 shares of SOUN which was around 3.7 million at the time of the investment. Yes I KNOW THAT INVESTMENT WAS NOT RECENT. I swear to god if one of you says that in the comments. Listen up regards, you know what is recent? Rishi Dhall the VP of Automotive at Nvidia announcing they are working with SoundHound (SH) to bring gen AI into cars. Here’s the direct quote, “We’re working with innovative partners like SoundHound to bring generative AI and accelerated compute into the car - enhancing the occupant experience and bringing greater safety behind the wheel. SoundHound’s in-vehicle voice interface, powered by NVIDIA DRIVE, can provide drivers with fast, accurate information, even when there’s no connection.” If directly working with Nvidia doesn’t get you up then maybe you need to get that checked out.  


**Road to profitability:**   
Revenue model. Product royalties &amp; service subscriptions. They have secured payment processing partnerships with Toast, Oracle and Square. Demand is through the roof, Daddy Keyvan Mohajer, CEO of SH, said that they have to put “multi-national chains with tens of thousands of locations” on hold to deal with EVEN BIGGER COMPANIES. Just one year ago SH was knocking on companies doors to get their business, now they have a WAIT LIST them. Some companies are signing contracts with SH for TEN YEARS. The avg is 6.5 years! Money going toward soliciting for sales will be DECIMATED.  


SH recently (feb 2024) INCREASED their revenue guidance for 2024 and 2025 with revenue at 70 million for 2024, and exceeding 100 million for 2025. Revenue at 70 million is almost DOUBLE of 2023’s revenue of 38.227 million. Why does this matter? Companies DO NOT say they are increasing revenue unless they are SUPER confident, having to backtrack on guidance is not something companies want to do. CFO Nitesh Sharon of SH said “... in the restaurant space that for us is billions and billions of annual revenue opportunity. And we’re just scratching the surface of it.”  
Being that SH is close to profitability, and once profitable, they have $395 million fed and $109 million state losses from previous years that they can write off on any future income thus allowing for EVENGREATER REVENUE MARGINS.    


 **Consumer feedback:**   
Restaurants using SoundHound AI love their service and plan on continuing their subscriptions. See SoundHound’s most recent YT video from Detroit's Original Chicken Shack [Fast and Efficient: How Detroit’s Original Chicken Shack Is Winning with AI](https://youtu.be/JAUYDSseUGk?si=NRQ6g0myoVEUXTAB) Even the employees love this phone answering service, cause THEY DON’T HAVE TO ANSWER THE DAMN PHONE ANYMORE. Anyone who’s worked in the service industry knows how awesome this is. THIS PROVES SH RESTAURANT SERVICES ISN'T JUST FOR DRIVE THRU AI TERMINALS. But those are great too.   


**SYNQ3** **Acquisition:**

* This brings in over 10,000 signed restaurants, with 100,000 in the pipeline.
* Will enhance SoundHound’s AI models by bringing in the data of 50 million interactions
* This acquisition helps SoundHound solidify themselves as the restaurant AI leader
* Brings in Steve Bigari, CEO and Co-Founder of SYQN3 and a former McDonald’s Operator  


SH announced yet another TOP 15 fast food chain has been secured and that announcement will be soon.  
MY OWN THOUGHTS: As fast food chains look toward AI and see their competitors lining up to use SH’s services, we will see the major chains follow suit soon. Do you think Old Uncle McDonald and his farm want to go with a competitor like Presto Automation who can barely keep their lights on? Who even likes Presto? Yuck! No, they will want to go with SoundHound AI. When this next Top 15 fast food chain is announced, I suspect another jump in SH’s share price soon. Last time SOUN jumped to 10 dollars the short interest dropped to 9% as short sellers closed their positions helping run the price up. Short interest is back up to 13% already, and I can't wait to see this short sellers get burned. SOUN to the moon 🚀

I sell options on a weekly basis. I prefer cash secured puts and covered calls. Sometimes I’m ahead of the indexes and sometimes I’m behind. My goal is to keep generating a solid income. 

Last year I sold 964 options and I’m at 308 year to date.

2022 $8,551 in premium.
2023 $22,908 in premium.
2024 $8,618 YTD.

January $1,858
February $3,670

SoundHound AI is forecast to increase revenue approximately 50% in both 2024 and 2025, according to Yahoo Finance. Given last year's sales of roughly $46 million, this implies SoundHound AI will reach $100 million in revenue by 2025.

For this analysis, I'll assume that SoundHound AI can keep growing revenue at 50% through 2030. Should the company achieve this level of growth, this would result in $780 million of sales by 2030.

Additionally, SoundHound AI stock recently traded at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 29.3. Assuming this normalizes to a more reasonable level of 15, for example, SoundHound AI's future market cap would be around $11.7 billion.

This is roughly 550% higher than the company's current market cap. This means that a hypothetical investment of $100,000 would be worth $650,000 by 2030 -- far from $1 million.

75,SOUN,$TSM Stands for The Stonk Machine,"Whats up my fellow degens, I hope your weekend is going well. I had tendies for dinner, and I hope you did too. 

Disclaimer, this post is full of my opinions. I encourage you to make your own, you have a brain, hopefully, so use it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've started to notice that some of you regards will go all in on a shit show of a stonk like bbai and soun when they're up 2-3x in a week, you have absolutely no idea what they do, and never heard of the company until tomorrow. But fuck it, we ball. Someone told you to buy that bitch so we in it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then a real company comes along, enter $TSM. Possibly one of the most critical companies to our modern day society. They make \~60% of all chips in the world and \~90% of advanced chips (smaller process nodes) based on last estimates that I saw. They are the dominating force behind the manufacturing (fab) of the majority of the worlds chips. Top customers like Apple, Nvidia, AMD, the list goes on. It doesn't matter who the flavor of the week is in the semi world, TSM will always have the orders flowing through them to do the actual fab. They go up 10 percent in a week, drop 2 percent on Friday and some of yall freak the fuck OUT. ITS THE END. ITS A PUMP AND DUMP. FUCKKKKKKKKK. Its 10 percent up for the week, chill the fuck out. Its a 2 percent pull back, chill the fuck out. 

&amp;#x200B;

The fact is that most companies aren't ""chip makers"" as people call them. They are really ""chip designers"" (yea, looking at you Nvidia). That's just the way it works in the semiconductor industry. These companies are the face, they design and sell chips, but without TSM they are effectively nothing. TSM is the chip maker. Yea, there are others of course - but TSM is leaps ahead and everyone else is just trying to catch up. That's how its been.

&amp;#x200B;

The design of semiconductors is nothing to scoff at. But the fab of these chips is where the real complexity is at. There is a reason that most all companies decide to outsource this process. The capital requirements, ramp time, and expertise required is 10 fold difficulty compared to hiring some designers to make a chip with a pretty case. There's no reason to compete. Have an expert make your chip for you with all their expensive, fancy equipment, and slap your brand on the top. TSM is that expert. 

&amp;#x200B;

The world has a fixed capacity to manufacture chips, and TSM controls the vast majority of that capacity.

&amp;#x200B;

**Pros:** 

* Dominating force behind the actual fabrication of the majority of all chips in the world. Everything from semiconductors in your toaster, computer, to tens or hundreds that go in your car. 
* Solid monthly revenue in Jan/Feb (7.9% and 11.3% YoY increase respectively)
* Nvidia conference this month will likely give them more visibility and a further boost
* Increased semiconductor demand from most companies means more demand for TSM. Not specifically dependent on one customer or sector to do well. Generally semi demand goes up, TSM gets more orders. 
* Expecting the US chips act beneficiaries to be announced this month, and they are likely going to receive multi billion dollars ($5B?) to further develop manufacturing capacity within the US. 
* Quarterly earnings on 4/18 will most likely look decent, and more importantly they will probably have a killer outlook based on orders coming in from top customers (Apple, Nvidia, AMD, ...) for the next few years due to the booming AI hardware needs that all come back to, you guessed it, TSM. 
* In 4 years their monthly revenue has \~doubled. Its public information go look at 2020 revenue for Jan/Feb vs 2024. In general you will see their revenue is constantly booming as a general trend. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Cons:** 

* Your wife's boyfriend said it was stupid.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Some common Q&amp;A and Concerns:**  
**Concern:** B..But what about China! Id rather invest in Nvidia and play it safe!

**A:** Nvidia, and many others will collapse into a fraction of what they are today. What is a chip designer without an advanced fab partner? Will you buy cool pictures and schematics from NVidia of things they could make if only they had fab facilities? Will you buy their awesome IP and patents? Put that piece of paper in your PC and see how fast it will render. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Q:** B...But what about China! TSM will collapse if that happens!

**A:** Yea, so will the broader stock market. So will most semi stonks. So will the sky when bombs start dropping. We got bigger shit to worry about if that were to happen. The impact of this (unlikely event) being specific to TSM is far overblown. Every piece of tech produced today will become highly less available, and prices of anything with chips would skyrocket. TSM also has Fab locations around the world, not just in Taiwan. My understanding is that more of the advanced fab is kept in Taiwan (smaller process nodes), but they are in the process of expanding, including in the US. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Q:** B.....But TSM is way overvalued! 

**A:** Is it? TSM is quite possibly the most valuable company in today's technological society that most people never heard of and are just becoming aware of. This company is trading around 20-30PE ratio range and is over valued? Ok lets go buy more BBAI instead so we dont get rekt. Oof, too soon? Go look at the PE ratio of half the companies you invest in and come back to me. In my opinion TSM could have a 2T market cap and not be over valued. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Q:** B.....But TSM is gonna have the rug pulled!

**A:** What fucking rug? TSM is up 60% in the past year. QQQ is up 46%. Its slightly outperforming QQQ and its barely breached its previous ATH by around 15% increase (back in 2021 - 2022 timeframe). There is no fucking rug. TSM is the concrete foundation that the rugs are set on. It's always there even when those shitty rugs get pulled out from under you to hold your stupid ass up.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Q:** B.......But TSM will crash at earnings!

**A:** Will it? Will a company who is getting dramatically increased orders for semiconductor fab due to a spike in AI hardware demand have a slower year? Forget about the drastic increase in AI hardware, they always have more demand and expansions. Look at what they have done, and what they are doing today. They are expanding capacity and revenue all the time. They are doing nothing but becoming more and more dominate. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Q:** B.....But semiconductor manufacturing capacity is booked way ahead of time. Things move slow!

**A:** Yea, so what the hell do you think these companies are doing now? they are booking for the coming years with their expected boom in AI demand so they can have TSM capacity reserved now, and in the future. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR:

Dig deep, get your fucking balls out of your wife's boyfriends purse, and buy $TSM because this bitch isn't a fucking pump and dump. It's just getting started. If you think slightly outperforming QQQ is a pump and dump, you probably have PTSD from your mom getting pumped and dumped, don't take that shit out on $TSM. Go buy more BBAI calls where you belong. 

* $TSM Good
* $TSM Has a ton of room to run
* $TSM runs the world
* Buy more $TSM and get those tendies
* Paperhands don't deserve the gains that are yet to come.

I had tendies for dinner, and I hope you did too. 

Disclaimer, this post is full of my opinions. I encourage you to make your own, you have a brain, hopefully, so use it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've started to notice that some of you regards will go all in on a shit show of a stonk like bbai and soun when they're up 2-3x in a week, you have absolutely no idea what they do, and never heard of the company until tomorrow. But fuck it, we ball. Someone told you to buy that bitch so we in it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then a real company comes along, enter $TSM. Possibly one of the most critical companies to our modern day society. They make \~60% of all chips in the world and \~90% of advanced chips (smaller process nodes) based on last estimates that I saw. They are the dominating force behind the manufacturing (fab) of the majority of the worlds chips. Top customers like Apple, Nvidia, AMD, the list goes on. It doesn't matter who the flavor of the week is in the semi world, TSM will always have the orders flowing through them to do the actual fab. They go up 10 percent in a week, drop 2 percent on Friday and some of yall freak the fuck OUT. ITS THE END. ITS A PUMP AND DUMP. FUCKKKKKKKKK. Its 10 percent up for the week, chill the fuck out. Its a 2 percent pull back, chill the fuck out. 

&amp;#x200B;

The fact is that most companies aren't ""chip makers"" as people call them. They are really ""chip designers"" (yea, looking at you Nvidia). That's just the way it works in the semiconductor industry. These companies are the face, they design and sell chips, but without TSM they are effectively nothing. TSM is the chip maker. Yea, there are others of course - but TSM is leaps ahead and everyone else is just trying to catch up. That's how its been.

&amp;#x200B;

The design of semiconductors is nothing to scoff at. But the fab of these chips is where the real complexity is at. There is a reason that most all companies decide to outsource this process. The capital requirements, ramp time, and expertise required is 10 fold difficulty compared to hiring some designers to make a chip with a pretty case. There's no reason to compete. Have an expert make your chip for you with all their expensive, fancy equipment, and slap your brand on the top. TSM is that expert. 

&amp;#x200B;

The world has a fixed capacity to manufacture chips, and TSM controls the vast majority of that capacity.

&amp;#x200B;

**Pros:** 

* Dominating force behind the actual fabrication of the majority of all chips in the world. Everything from semiconductors in your toaster, computer, to tens or hundreds that go in your car. 
* Solid monthly revenue in Jan/Feb (7.9% and 11.3% YoY increase respectively)
* Nvidia conference this month will likely give them more visibility and a further boost
* Increased semiconductor demand from most companies means more demand for TSM. Not specifically dependent on one customer or sector to do well. Generally semi demand goes up, TSM gets more orders. 
* Expecting the US chips act beneficiaries to be announced this month, and they are likely going to receive multi billion dollars ($5B?) to further develop manufacturing capacity within the US. 
* Quarterly earnings on 4/18 will most likely look decent, and more importantly they will probably have a killer outlook based on orders coming in from top customers (Apple, Nvidia, AMD, ...) for the next few years due to the booming AI hardware needs that all come back to, you guessed it, TSM. 
* In 4 years their monthly revenue has \~doubled. Its public information go look at 2020 revenue for Jan/Feb vs 2024. In general you will see their revenue is constantly booming as a general trend. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Cons:** 

* Your wife's boyfriend said it was stupid.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Some common Q&amp;A and Concerns:**  
**Concern:** B..But what about China! Id rather invest in Nvidia and play it safe!

**A:** Nvidia, and many others will collapse into a fraction of what they are today. What is a chip designer without an advanced fab partner? Will you buy cool pictures and schematics from NVidia of things they could make if only they had fab facilities? Will you buy their awesome IP and patents? Put that piece of paper in your PC and see how fast it will render. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Q:** B...But what about China! TSM will collapse if that happens!

**A:** Yea, so will the broader stock market. So will most semi stonks. So will the sky when bombs start dropping. We got bigger shit to worry about if that were to happen. The impact of this (unlikely event) being specific to TSM is far overblown. Every piece of tech produced today will become highly less available, and prices of anything with chips would skyrocket. TSM also has Fab locations around the world, not just in Taiwan. My understanding is that more of the advanced fab is kept in Taiwan (smaller process nodes), but they are in the process of expanding, including in the US. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Q:** B.....But TSM is way overvalued! 

**A:** Is it? TSM is quite possibly the most valuable company in today's technological society that most people never heard of and are just becoming aware of. This company is trading around 20-30PE ratio range and is over valued? Ok lets go buy more BBAI instead so we dont get rekt. Oof, too soon? Go look at the PE ratio of half the companies you invest in and come back to me. In my opinion TSM could have a 2T market cap and not be over valued. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Q:** B.....But TSM is gonna have the rug pulled!

**A:** What fucking rug? TSM is up 60% in the past year. QQQ is up 46%. Its slightly outperforming QQQ and its barely breached its previous ATH by around 15% increase (back in 2021 - 2022 timeframe). There is no fucking rug. TSM is the concrete foundation that the rugs are set on. It's always there even when those shitty rugs get pulled out from under you to hold your stupid ass up.

After week 10 the average weekly premium is $731 with a projected annual premium of $38,022.

I sell options on a weekly basis. I prefer cash secured puts and covered calls. Last year I was fairly even between the two, this year I am selling many more covered calls. This is probably due to the fact that over the last two years I loaded up on LEAPS and purchased high quality tickers along the way. I did this coming into the end of 2022 and the beginning of 2023. Which means that I have more tickers to sell on a weekly and monthly basis.

76,SOUN,$VHAI fundamentals are interesting,"I got into $VHAI a few days ago hoping that it might be the next $SOUN. But it has since dipped further, and I've now been looking at their fundamentals more. Boy was this interesting.... I've then **cut my losses and taken a short position** instead. I'll try to keep this post factual for reasons that you may be able to imagine, so draw your own conclusions.

Take a look at [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FcjoSfDLdk). Here their CEO Brian Podolak (presumably u/vocodia_brian) is making a call with their ""DISA"" digital sales agent. Looks very impressive, right? Now check out the date, it's from two years ago! Man, given this kind of revolutionary technology ***two years ago***, **why haven't they already mooned**? Just that computer voice alone, even without its ability to converse and understand, was an amazing achievement at a time when publicly available LLMs were purely text-based, no? Perhaps this voice even sounds a little *too* human? In any case, the fact that they're still a tiny startup with \~10 employees is baffling to say the least.

So what actually is their AI technology? Let's take a look at [this interview](https://medium.com/authority-magazine/brian-podolak-of-vocodia-on-the-future-of-artificial-intelligence-f1aaa8d2a8fb) with Brian. Here, he says that ""we were searching for AI solutions \[..\], but nothing out there was quite what we needed. So, we decided to build our own from scratch"". But no details are given of how they achieved that. Worse, the bios on Vocodia's website give **no indication of any AI technology background** by Brian or their CTO James Sposato.

Instead, there's talk about a database of pre-recorded snippets. So the answers given by the ""AI"" in the video are pre-recorded snippets? Uhm, I hope they're not, because the DISA responds very specifically to what Brian says and this won't apply in other calls.

Finally, let's look at their sales. My research has turned up **no public information about any past or existing clients, even two years after an apparently revolutionary product**.

there is no pattern. Up, down, up down, fucking forklift. One thing I do ses is that they were/are red but the slowly moving into green. Which is effectively good guidance and hence, stonk go brrr. They're receiving subsidies and what not. Actual AI users and are doing real AI shit and not some random bumfuck name with a .ai tag (yes SOUn and BBAI, looking at you).

Why do i think it will go up even tho the charts aren't great per se? Mainly because semiconductors weren't as much as a hotshot in the past quarters. But this time. MY GOD. You name it, it's flying. Chip manufacturers are on a roll and MRVL is no different. NVDA for GPUs, AMD/INTC for CPUs, ICs, MRVL for switches, IC components. this is how it is. They're getting in the big leagues. Should just follow NVDA's path.

This is more like a sentiment play rather than ER play but well, if it makes you bags, who cares, right?

**Eww. That title is cringe af but eh. So, today is a biggg day. COST, MRVL, AVGO, BBAI, DOCU, MDB, MRVL. All in one day? Fk me wow. My plays and research on MRVL and DOCU:**

**DOCU - Docusign**

So a cloud company doing electronic signatures. CyberSec and Cloud companies keep getting molested at earnings. Do i even need to name how many? CRWD was one single exception. Yea these guys might not be the same, but fuck it, they all keep stripping naked at earnings. This is gon be a repeat telecast. Look at the numbers:

[EPS in the decline](https://preview.redd.it/fqm72lbylxmc1.png?width=1648&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1881f0d9fb04d7d64bc8b49f52ac81098c034c8)

* DocuSign EPS for the quarter ending October 31, 2023 was **$0.19**, a **226.67% decline** year-over-year.
* DocuSign EPS for the twelve months ending October 31, 2023 was **$0.25**, a **137.31% decline** year-over-year.
* DocuSign 2023 annual EPS was **$-0.49**, a **36.11% increase** from 2022.

Now revenue/sales

* DocuSign gross profit for the twelve months ending October 31, 2023 was **$2.147B**, a **12.58% increase** year-over-year.
* DocuSign annual gross profit for 2023 was **$1.98B**, a **20.67% increase** from 2022.

EPS: declining, Profits: declining, Revenue: declining. All deciding factors are going fishing down the toilet bowl. Which means they gonna take a dump. Sure they may still be green and beat earnings by a small margin, yes. but that doesn't matter since guidance is what decides the fate. I'm going puts, to each their own though. Screw that I had to sign DOCUsign shit 30 times when applying for college grants and they ran into some authentication errors which screwed up my grants??? Fuck them. Short the bastard.

Disclaimer: these guys tend to move a day or two after earnings. So only take something ATM, or just OTM.

**Now MRVL - Marvell Technology**

**MMMMM. TASTY. AI AI AI. CHIPSSS. SEMICONDUCTORS YEAHHH. Ooh baby, I'm already having wet dreams.**

Shit gonna fly. AI in hardware? They're a mini NVDA, AMD, INTC, TSM copy. Poised to blast off. Will it moon? Nope. It will Jupiter. Shit gonna take the fuck off real real soon.

Now I would normaly show you charts but this one is erratic. All over the place. Have a look:

there is no pattern. Up, down, up down, fucking forklift. One thing I do ses is that they were/are red but the slowly moving into green. Which is effectively good guidance and hence, stonk go brrr. They're receiving subsidies and what not. Actual AI users and are doing real AI shit and not some random bumfuck name with a .ai tag (yes SOUn and BBAI, looking at you).

Why do i think it will go up even tho the charts aren't great per se? Mainly because semiconductors weren't as much as a hotshot in the past quarters. But this time. MY GOD. You name it, it's flying. Chip manufacturers are on a roll and MRVL is no different. NVDA for GPUs, AMD/INTC for CPUs, ICs, MRVL for switches, IC components. this is how it is. They're getting in the big leagues. Should just follow NVDA's path.

This is more like a sentiment play rather than ER play but well, if it makes you bags, who cares, right?

I'm going calls on MRVL. Expecting green dildos.

I've not taken positions yet coz RH won't let me instant transfer lmfao. Prob wait till 2pm to get cheaper positions?

I'll  research on a couple more but just these two for now. Gonna take me a few hours for COST, AVGO, BBAI, MDB, etc. Aight guys, seeya soon. I've got an ass that I need to kiss right now

78,SOUN,ANF - Where Your Wife's Boyfriend Shops,"While the market roars and your wife is out shopping using your credit card(s) (maxed out at 11k, 32k, and 1.8k) with her new boyfriend, you decide to follow along to finally feel something after losing all your money on SOUN, MARA, and (soon) BBAI. Upon following them to the mall, you notice where they get out, a small luxury store that you think you've seen marketed on popular apps like TikTok. 

Introducing $ANF.

&amp;#x200B;

ANF -  Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Company is an American retailer that focuses on upscale casual wear for young consumers, and it is well known for its brand image of casual luxury that appeals to the collegiate demographic. The company operates through a multi-faceted business model that includes direct-to-consumer sales through its stores and website, as well as a wholesale presence in select luxury retailers. Abercrombie &amp; Fitch's business model is designed to maintain a strong brand identity, characterized by a distinctive store experience, high-quality merchandise, and marketing that emphasizes a youthful, aspirational lifestyle. This approach has helped the company establish a loyal customer base and differentiate itself in the competitive retail market. 

In summary, they sell really overpriced 'hip' clothes to college students who use their daddy's credit card. They also sell some clothes cheap on discount after they sell most of it at 1000% markup, but you get the idea.

ANF has not only profited massively this last year, but over the past few years in general. The stock and company fashion has taken off amongst a younger crowd  after well done marketing on popular apps like Insta and TikTok.

[$ANF - 2016 vs Today](https://preview.redd.it/bygsrt9ro8mc1.png?width=1422&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b983ebd30bed00a428fe9093d532899a42191ff)

Abercrombie &amp; Fitch has embarked on a significant transformation journey, shifting from being labeled as America’s “most hated retail brand” in 2016 to achieving ""decade-high"" net sales in the first quarter of 2024. This turnaround was orchestrated by adopting a more inclusive and diverse branding strategy, updating their product lines with modern styles, leveraging data analytics, and implementing features like Buy Online Pick-up In Store (BOPIS). A key figure in this revival has been the new CEO, who has steered the brand towards appealing to a broader demographic and responding positively to contemporary consumer expectations.

Central to Abercrombie's revitalization strategy is an enhanced focus on marketing and social media engagement, where the brand has notably increased its marketing investments by 20 Mil. By cultivating a vast network of influencers across various interests, Abercrombie has tailored its approach to Gen Z and millennial audiences. Megan Brophy, the VP of brand marketing, emphasizes the importance of authenticity and allowing influencers to maintain their creative freedom when promoting the brand.

So let's check the financials then.  

Abercrombie &amp; Fitch's financials and strategic initiatives seem to underscore the success of their turnaround efforts. As of the third quarter of 2023, the company reported a notable net sales growth of +20%, with comparable sales growth of +16%. This growth was observed across both Abercrombie and Hollister brands, with Abercrombie brands seeing a +30% increase and Hollister brands an +11% increase. The operating margin for this period was reported at 13.1%, which represents a significant expansion of 1,110 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2022. This improvement was attributed to a combination of gross profit rate expansion and operational efficiencies​​. So, ANF had incredible EPS beats in the past, something that will likely hold true this earnings.

https://preview.redd.it/bmk2o4vll8mc1.png?width=1384&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f24b4a5186025ff627c164e6401eea9289f50280

Further strengthening the optimism around Abercrombie &amp; Fitch's financial health, the company increased its net sales and operating margin outlook for the fourth quarter based on better-than-expected holiday sales. The revised forecast anticipates high-teens net sales growth with an operating margin of around 15%​​. This forward-looking optimism is mirrored in the company's robust social media presence and strategic marketing investments, aimed at engaging a diverse audience through a network of influencers across various platforms​​. These efforts, coupled with the financial performance, suggest Abercrombie &amp; Fitch is on a positive trajectory, aligning with the company's goal of repositioning itself in the market. 

TLDR, it's a growth and a comeback story (with great earnings). Who doesn't love that? 

The economy is booming consumer spending is going up. Inflation is up. Whether its a bubble or not remains to be seen, but it (probably) isn't popping this week from ANF.

Now, lets check the options chain to see who our poor IV buyer will be. I am not certain that the stock will go up to 160, so I plan on hedging my bets as I also plan to buy into Docu and MDB for earnings plays this week and still want some moneys.

&amp;#x200B;

[The volume at 140 and 145 is pretty large. Sell to these fools.](https://preview.redd.it/fmugb5rmn8mc1.png?width=2146&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb836489aac32dd7bcd8e1aeb2fc9557d4e09ab8)

But how will I buy these expensive calls? I will be buying a Long Call Vertical, known as the poor mans covered call, since I can not pay for my wife's boyfriends shoes and a full call. Thus, I cap my earnings at 2-3x my cost depending on strike, a great bet. I'm ok at 2x. If you do a 135Buy -150Sell you can 3x.

With these profits, I will be playing into MDB and DOCU later. Stay tuned if it goes well.

22,SOUN,"Week 9 $1,378 in premium","I will post a separate comment with a link to the detail behind all options sold for week 9.

After week 9 the average weekly premium is $637 with a projected annual premium of $33,124.

I don’t know what the QQQ is up this week, feel free to comment about that or any index you feel is doing well. I sell options on a weekly basis and my concern is primarily revenue generation. Do I care about the overall performance of my portfolio, of course. 

The portfolio is composed of 90 unique tickers with a value of $168,900. Coincidentally, I also have 90 open options with a value of approximately $62,300. The two total about $231k. Of the $62,300, $29,950 is collateral for cash secured PUTs (CSPs).

I do want to point out that the options look a little off this week. This is primarily due to the way a covered call is calculated. I am not saying anything is wrong per se, I just think it is misleading. Some of you may have noticed the ticker VKTX up 137% over the last week and mostly in 1 day (Tuesday). This correlates to my chart above. Anyway, I have a covered call out on this ticker. Covered calls as you know cap your gains. Well, my strike is $15 and the current value is $85. This is showing as a $6,600 unrealized loss. 

When you sell a covered call, you agree to sell the underlying at the strike price upfront. However, the calculation does not stop after the underlying passes the strike, as it should. I don’t owe $6,600 and I’m not losing $6,600, it is just showing the amount of potential gains that I missed out on. So, had I not written the contract for the covered call I would have made $6,600, so this is just rubbing the amount I could have made in my face. 

Hope you guys had a successful week, look forward to hearing about your wins!

85,SOUN,PUTS on SOUN (media using NVDA's 13-F to mislead retail investors),"Hi all - I almost never post but the recent run-up of SOUN (as well as NNOX, RXRX) are pure hype being driven by the media's incorrect interpretation of NVDA's recent 13-F filing.

Companies that hold &gt;$100M of public equities are required to report an 13-F filing. NVDA filed their first ever 13-F report on February 14th, 2024. The media picked that up and is spinning the narrative as if NVDA just initiated these positions and are going to establish some kind of strategic relationship. That is not the case.

The reality is that NVDA was only recently required to file a 13-F report because they invested $100M in ARM's IPO. This pushed their total holdings above the $100M threshold and made them report on all of their public equity positions. Many of these positions were established a long time ago and have no basis on any meaningful strategic relationship.

SOUN is one such example. Per Pitchbook, Nvidia invested in SOUN during the companies Series C (2015) and Series D (2017) rounds. This was made by Nvidia GPU Ventures, which invests in AI startups to support the NVDA GPU ecosystem. There hasn't been any meaningful partnerships announced between NVDA and SOUN since they invested.

So what is SOUN? They're a voice-recognition AI company like Shazam (but smaller). The company went public via. SPAC in April 2022, raised a bunch of equity, burned it all, and raised a bunch of debt to stay afloat.

I know SOUN is a semi meme stock with wiild swings , which equates to a high premium. 

No my thoughts are sale CC 3dte $8 OR $9 strike which is a 50 delta or so. The premium is $100 so i feel thats not bad for a $700 investment. I could probably capture 50% of the premium over the course of today and tomorrow.  

If the trade goes against me ill just try to roll up and out until i.e a 45dte or so. I could just left myself get excercised as well. But since its semi meme status i expect premiums to go up very high then eventually drop. Rather due to iv crush from sideways trading or a huge drop. 

Now i realize from my prior experience that managing this trade may be very stressful.  I guess i could wheel it if i get pushed out? Premium is premium?

What are other things i should be aware of or change in my strategy.  I dont mind holding the stock long term based on the AI craze

25,SOUN,These are the stocks on my watchlist (2/15),"  

No positions in any stocks long-term but Amazon/Mag7/general broad market indices. (unless otherwise noted in these tickers)

To clarify since I've been asked: I usually make these watchlists premarket, (or from 6:30 to 7 as time permits), but can be delayed if I'm trading the open. These aren't mean to be taken as gospel: they're just my perspective of where a stock could potentially go. Percentages signify what the stock is trading at when I write up the report and are NOT predictions of stock price EOD. Some of the stocks I post are &lt;$500M market cap and are NOT good long-term investments, but are good candidates to day trade.

**No watchlist tomorrow, will be out of town.**

**SOUN-** Earnings. NVDA discloses new stake (1M shares) in SOUN. This is NOT going to be as explosive as BMR- different stock fundamentals and market cap is 10x higher. Still worth keeping on watchlist though.

94,SOUN,6=22=23 Volume moving tickers,"Trading Thesis: Tracking the float along with daily volume along with company financials helps to narrow down moving tickers
Fundamental and technical analysis is often used to find growth tickers and information about them. Fundamental analysis looks to see whether an investment is overvalued or undervalued based on underlying economic conditions, as well as the finances of the company or other organization that issued a stock or bond. Technical analysis instead looks at patterns in the price of an investment to predict future movements in that investment’s price. 
I look for tickers that are trading at least 2 million in volume a day, with a market-cap of no less than 500 million. 
The shares traded are compared to the average volume to determine how much of the float is used (Or shares traded). That information is compiled with data on how profitable the company is and how much cash do they have compared to what is expected.

Things to consider when finding the plays-

·       If the stock volume has traded 1 million or more in volume premarket, I will use that and calculate a rough estimate on what the stock will trade for the day. 

·       If the ticker looks to be trading more volume than the day before, I will consider it for a long play. If trading less than the movement of the ticker, I would consider a short or put play.  (If all the other factors previously mentioned checks out.)

26,SOUN,"Expected moves today, Powell, SPY, VIX","Futures are lower for a 3rd straight day as the market waits for Fed Chair Powell's testimony in front of Congress. Some of his prepared remarks were released before the bell. The 3 day losing streak hasn't added up to much of a sell-off as of yet. The SPY is lower by about 1.5% since an intra-week high last Thursday. Nor has it affected vol much, the VIX is even lower than it was during that Thursday high in stocks. 

As mentioned alot recently, yes vol is low, but the moves in the market are also very muted. The realized vol in SPY over the past month now sits at 12. Options in SPY are about 11 vol for the upcoming few weeks. In other words, IV is currently reflective of how the market is moving. Therefore option buyers are still having to get direction correct and be very nimble, despite how ""cheap"" vol is. Short-term option trading is basically a battle between implied vol, and realized vol. The mean reversion of IV (buying low IV, selling high IV) typically needs more time to play out. Speaking of that, when vol is this low for this long it's sometimes helpful to begin to look out a few months and see how low IV has been dragged down by what's happening recently. A look at SPY vol out in November and December shows at-the-money vol around 15-16. To put that in perspective, that's both below historical averages for IV, but it's also much lower than the realized vol if SPY over the past year, which is around 20, even with the slow grind of the past few months.

**Chart of the Day:**

SPY vol is just 15 in November

Some of his prepared remarks were released before the bell. The 3 day losing streak hasn't added up to much of a sell-off as of yet. The SPY is lower by about 1.5% since an intra-week high last Thursday. Nor has it affected vol much, the VIX is even lower than it was during that Thursday high in stocks. 

As mentioned alot recently, yes vol is low, but the moves in the market are also very muted. The realized vol in SPY over the past month now sits at 12. Options in SPY are about 11 vol for the upcoming few weeks. In other words, IV is currently reflective of how the market is moving. Therefore option buyers are still having to get direction correct and be very nimble, despite how ""cheap"" vol is. Short-term option trading is basically a battle between implied vol, and realized vol. The mean reversion of IV (buying low IV, selling high IV) typically needs more time to play out. Speaking of that, when vol is this low for this long it's sometimes helpful to begin to look out a few months and see how low IV has been dragged down by what's happening recently. A look at SPY vol out in November and December shows at-the-money vol around 15-16. To put that in perspective, that's both below historical averages for IV, but it's also much lower than the realized vol if SPY over the past year, which is around 20, even with the slow grind of the past few months.

## Trading Thesis - Feast Your Eyes on the Tastiest Crayons 🖍️

Just like Vanellope's candy-coated racecar dashes across Sugar Rush, technical analysis zooms through past prices to predict the sweet spots of today. 🚗💨

My top-secret recipe for predicting winning plays involves blending option open interest with a sprinkle of Delta and Gamma greeks. Presto! We get tantalizing price levels where volatility is juiciest and the market hovers near equilibrium. Talk about a sugar rush! 😋

Sometimes, the underlying price dances around like a sugarplum fairy, reacting to delta neutrality or maximum gamma. My magical trading signals spring from the past reactions to these prices that put you in the fast lane to success. 🏁

To make your wallet sweeter, I whip up plays and target entry prices using a binomial option pricing model. It's like a candy-factory conveyor belt, spewing out profit, direction and increased IV! 🍭

## Notes - The Perfect Recipe for Trading Brain Gains 🧠💡

* If the price has zipped past the entry, beware! It means the market gobbled up the goodies before you took a bite.
* Grab half your winnings when you double, and ride the sugar-high of the rest at your leisure. 🍬
* I'm the careful candy-maker, only risking 1% of my fortune on trades, and going even lighter when I'm less sure of success. 🍫
* These scrumptious trades are based on yesterday's intel, so chew on that when jumping in late. Don't let fresh price moves spoil the confectionery goodness. 🍪

## FAQ - Common Sweet Inquiries 🍩🍬

# [Stock futures fall as traders assess chances of of higher rate hikes: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/08/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures dipped Thursday as traders continue to process comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and await key employment data.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell by 45 points, or 0.1%. S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq-100 futures slipped 0.3% and 0.6%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Those moves come a day after Powell reiterated his warning message to lawmakers that the central bank may raise interest rates higher than previously anticipated. However, he emphasized that no decision has been made yet regarding the March meeting.
*****
&gt; “The market is finally coming to the realization that elevated interest rates are here to stay and the idea of a Fed pivot anytime soon is wishful thinking,” Main Street Research’s chief investment officer James Demmert said Thursday.
*****
&gt; “The global economy is more resilient than many realized, which will make inflation stickier and is extending central bankers’ terminal rate target. Inflation has come down but is nowhere near the Fed’s 2% target, so there is much work to be done given the stubborn strength of the economy and wage inflation,” he added.
*****
&gt; Investors will get more indication on the state of the economy Friday, when the U.S. government releases its monthly jobs report. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect the U.S. economy to have added 225,000 jobs in February.
*****
&gt; On Wednesday, ADP reported that private payrolls increased by 242,000, more than expected. This reaffirmed the strength of the economy, which raised concern that rates could stay higher for longer.
*****
&gt; Investors on Thursday will be looking at the jobless claims report, which is due at 8:30 a.m. ET. Federal Reserve Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr is also scheduled to speak on cryptocurrencies.

# [Stock futures fall as traders assess chances of of higher rate hikes: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/08/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures dipped Thursday as traders continue to process comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and await key employment data.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell by 45 points, or 0.1%. S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq-100 futures slipped 0.3% and 0.6%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Those moves come a day after Powell reiterated his warning message to lawmakers that the central bank may raise interest rates higher than previously anticipated. However, he emphasized that no decision has been made yet regarding the March meeting.
*****
&gt; “The market is finally coming to the realization that elevated interest rates are here to stay and the idea of a Fed pivot anytime soon is wishful thinking,” Main Street Research’s chief investment officer James Demmert said Thursday.
*****
&gt; “The global economy is more resilient than many realized, which will make inflation stickier and is extending central bankers’ terminal rate target. Inflation has come down but is nowhere near the Fed’s 2% target, so there is much work to be done given the stubborn strength of the economy and wage inflation,” he added.
*****
&gt; Investors will get more indication on the state of the economy Friday, when the U.S. government releases its monthly jobs report. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect the U.S. economy to have added 225,000 jobs in February.
*****
&gt; On Wednesday, ADP reported that private payrolls increased by 242,000, more than expected. This reaffirmed the strength of the economy, which raised concern that rates could stay higher for longer.
*****
&gt; Investors on Thursday will be looking at the jobless claims report, which is due at 8:30 a.m. ET. Federal Reserve Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr is also scheduled to speak on cryptocurrencies.

# [Stock futures are flat following a selloff fueled by Powell’s comments: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/07/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures were little changed Wednesday, a day after a selloff spurred by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s comments indicating interest rates may need to go higher for longer.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures ticked higher by 35 points, or 0.1%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures rose marginally.
*****
&gt; The Dow closed nearly 575 points lower on Tuesday. The S&amp;P 500 slid 1.53% to close below the key 4,000 threshold, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.25%. The sharp decline for stocks was accompanied by a spike in bond yields, with the rate on the 2-year Treasury surpassing 5% and touching the highest level since 2007.
*****
&gt; The shakeup in markets came after Fed Chair Powell spoke before the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee. He cautioned lawmakers that the central bank’s terminal rate will likely be higher than previously anticipated due to stubbornly high economic data in recent weeks.
*****
&gt; ″[Powell] is being very, very clear that if you look at what happened over the past year and a half, the call on inflation didn’t pan out,” Morgan Stanley’s global chief economist Seth Carpenter said on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.”
*****
&gt; “I think now Powell is very much on board with the idea that he does not want to get caught flat-footed again, and so opening the door very wide for a 50 basis point hike was exactly what he did,” Carpenter added.
*****
&gt; On Wednesday, investors will be closely watching Powell speak before the House Financial Services Committee. Separately, Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin will also be speaking on the labor market Wednesday morning. January’s job openings and labor turnover data is due, as is the ADP jobs report for February.

# [Stock futures are flat following a selloff fueled by Powell’s comments: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/07/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures were little changed Wednesday, a day after a selloff spurred by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s comments indicating interest rates may need to go higher for longer.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures ticked higher by 35 points, or 0.1%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures rose marginally.
*****
&gt; The Dow closed nearly 575 points lower on Tuesday. The S&amp;P 500 slid 1.53% to close below the key 4,000 threshold, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.25%. The sharp decline for stocks was accompanied by a spike in bond yields, with the rate on the 2-year Treasury surpassing 5% and touching the highest level since 2007.
*****
&gt; The shakeup in markets came after Fed Chair Powell spoke before the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee. He cautioned lawmakers that the central bank’s terminal rate will likely be higher than previously anticipated due to stubbornly high economic data in recent weeks.
*****
&gt; ″[Powell] is being very, very clear that if you look at what happened over the past year and a half, the call on inflation didn’t pan out,” Morgan Stanley’s global chief economist Seth Carpenter said on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.”
*****
&gt; “I think now Powell is very much on board with the idea that he does not want to get caught flat-footed again, and so opening the door very wide for a 50 basis point hike was exactly what he did,” Carpenter added.
*****
&gt; On Wednesday, investors will be closely watching Powell speak before the House Financial Services Committee. Separately, Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin will also be speaking on the labor market Wednesday morning. January’s job openings and labor turnover data is due, as is the ADP jobs report for February.

# [Stock futures inch higher as Wall Street awaits Fed Chair Powell’s comments: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/06/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures traded marginally higher on Tuesday as traders await Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s latest comments on the state of the economy.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures traded flat. S&amp;P 500 futures gained 0.1%, while Nasdaq-100 futures added 0.2%.
*****
&gt; Dick’s Sporting Goods shares popped in premarket trading on a strong holiday quarter. WW International, also known as WeightWatchers, leapt 14% as it shared plans to acquire Sequence, a subscription telehealth platform with a focus on chronic weight management.
*****
&gt; The major averages are coming off a session that featured mild gains. The Dow on Monday advanced 0.1%, along with the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite.
*****
&gt; Stocks were higher to start the day after Goldman Sachs initiated coverage of Apple with a buy rating, lifting both the iPhone maker and the broader market. Apple makes up about 7% of the S&amp;P 500. Other mega-cap tech stocks such as Alphabet and Microsoft also advanced.
*****
&gt; However, the major averages gave up most of those gains following a slight rise in bond yields. Investors have been troubled by moves in the bond market after the 10-year Treasury yield recently topped a key 4% threshold.
*****
&gt; “It really just felt like back to kind of those 2020 days where a handful of the FANG names were doing a lot of the heavy lifting, and to us, that suggests this rally is feeling a bit on its last legs,” BTIG’s Jonathan Krinsky said Monday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell.”
*****
&gt; On deck Tuesday and Wednesday is congressional testimony from Fed Chair Powell, who will give remarks on where he sees the U.S. economy — and what he expects for interest rates to go from here.
*****
&gt; January wholesale inventories data is set to release Tuesday after the opening bell, giving investors insight into the consumer economy. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect a decline of 0.4%, compared to a rise of 0.1% in the prior reading.
*****
&gt; Consumer credit data expected Tuesday afternoon is forecasted to show a rise of $22 billion in January, according to consensus estimates from Dow Jones. That would follow a $11.6 billion increase the prior month.

# [Stock futures inch higher as Wall Street awaits Fed Chair Powell’s comments: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/06/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures traded marginally higher on Tuesday as traders await Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s latest comments on the state of the economy.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures traded flat. S&amp;P 500 futures gained 0.1%, while Nasdaq-100 futures added 0.2%.
*****
&gt; Dick’s Sporting Goods shares popped in premarket trading on a strong holiday quarter. WW International, also known as WeightWatchers, leapt 14% as it shared plans to acquire Sequence, a subscription telehealth platform with a focus on chronic weight management.
*****
&gt; The major averages are coming off a session that featured mild gains. The Dow on Monday advanced 0.1%, along with the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite.
*****
&gt; Stocks were higher to start the day after Goldman Sachs initiated coverage of Apple with a buy rating, lifting both the iPhone maker and the broader market. Apple makes up about 7% of the S&amp;P 500. Other mega-cap tech stocks such as Alphabet and Microsoft also advanced.
*****
&gt; However, the major averages gave up most of those gains following a slight rise in bond yields. Investors have been troubled by moves in the bond market after the 10-year Treasury yield recently topped a key 4% threshold.
*****
&gt; “It really just felt like back to kind of those 2020 days where a handful of the FANG names were doing a lot of the heavy lifting, and to us, that suggests this rally is feeling a bit on its last legs,” BTIG’s Jonathan Krinsky said Monday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell.”
*****
&gt; On deck Tuesday and Wednesday is congressional testimony from Fed Chair Powell, who will give remarks on where he sees the U.S. economy — and what he expects for interest rates to go from here.
*****
&gt; January wholesale inventories data is set to release Tuesday after the opening bell, giving investors insight into the consumer economy. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect a decline of 0.4%, compared to a rise of 0.1% in the prior reading.
*****
&gt; Consumer credit data expected Tuesday afternoon is forecasted to show a rise of $22 billion in January, according to consensus estimates from Dow Jones. That would follow a $11.6 billion increase the prior month.

# [Stock futures are little changed as investors look ahead to Powell comments, jobs data this week](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/05/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)
*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures were flat Monday as Wall Street looked ahead to a week filled with economic data and the latest commentary from the Federal Reserve.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell 43 points, or 0.1%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 hovered around the flatline.
*****
&gt; Traders are coming off a positive week for the major averages. The Dow industrials added 1.75% last week, ending a four-week losing streak. The S&amp;P 500 advanced 1.90%, while the Nasdaq capped the week with a 2.58% pop.
*****
&gt; Those gains come even as the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose above the psychological 4% level at various points last week. An upward move in the 10-year yield raises borrowing costs for consumers and could signal a drop in investor confidence.
*****
&gt; “If you’re afraid of a recession, go get the 10-year Treasury,” Sri-Kumar Global’s Sri Kumar told CNBC on Friday. “Equities are a losing proposition today, and until you see the valuations come down significantly, just don’t trust [Friday’s] rally.”
*****
&gt; Important catalysts this week include congressional testimony Tuesday and Wednesday from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who will guide investors and lawmakers on how the central bank is thinking about inflation and its rate-hiking campaign going forward.
*****
&gt; Traders are also anticipating the February jobs report on Friday, which follows January’s blockbuster report that showed the economy added 517,000 payrolls. Economists polled by Dow Jones are expecting 225,000 jobs added last month.
*****
&gt; On Monday, the latest factory orders data will also be released after the bell. Economists are expecting a decline of 1.8% in January, according to consensus estimates from Dow Jones. That’s compared to a 1.8% gain in the prior reading.

# [Stock futures are little changed as investors look ahead to Powell comments, jobs data this week](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/05/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)
*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures were flat Monday as Wall Street looked ahead to a week filled with economic data and the latest commentary from the Federal Reserve.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell 43 points, or 0.1%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 hovered around the flatline.
*****
&gt; Traders are coming off a positive week for the major averages. The Dow industrials added 1.75% last week, ending a four-week losing streak. The S&amp;P 500 advanced 1.90%, while the Nasdaq capped the week with a 2.58% pop.
*****
&gt; Those gains come even as the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose above the psychological 4% level at various points last week. An upward move in the 10-year yield raises borrowing costs for consumers and could signal a drop in investor confidence.
*****
&gt; “If you’re afraid of a recession, go get the 10-year Treasury,” Sri-Kumar Global’s Sri Kumar told CNBC on Friday. “Equities are a losing proposition today, and until you see the valuations come down significantly, just don’t trust [Friday’s] rally.”
*****
&gt; Important catalysts this week include congressional testimony Tuesday and Wednesday from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who will guide investors and lawmakers on how the central bank is thinking about inflation and its rate-hiking campaign going forward.
*****
&gt; Traders are also anticipating the February jobs report on Friday, which follows January’s blockbuster report that showed the economy added 517,000 payrolls. Economists polled by Dow Jones are expecting 225,000 jobs added last month.
*****
&gt; On Monday, the latest factory orders data will also be released after the bell. Economists are expecting a decline of 1.8% in January, according to consensus estimates from Dow Jones. That’s compared to a 1.8% gain in the prior reading.

# **Stocks close higher Friday, Dow breaks 4-week losing streak as 10-year Treasury yield retreats: Live updates - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/02/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks rose Friday as Treasury yields eased from their recent highs and investors weighed the cumulative impact from Fed hikes already implemented and digested this week’s comments from the central bank.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 387.40 points, or 1.17%, to 33,390.97. The S&amp;P 500 climbed 1.61% to 4,045.64, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.97% to close at 11,689.01.
*****
&gt; The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury note dipped below the 4% threshold. Traders have been watching 4% as the key level on the 10-year that could trigger another down move in stocks. At times this week when the 10-year rate rose above that point, stocks retreated.
*****
&gt; The 10-year Treasury is a benchmark rate that influences mortgages and car loans, so a breakout in the yield could ripple through the economy.
*****
&gt; “The stock market is very sensitive to bond yields at this point and looking for some respite to the recent upward moves in yields,” said Yung-Yu Ma, BMO Wealth Management chief investment strategist. “There’s a nervous anticipation to upcoming data releases for jobs and inflation after the difficult readings last month. The market is unlikely to have sustained traction until data points resume a cooling trend.”
*****
&gt; All of the major averages notched a winning week. The Dow posted a 1.75% gain and snapped a four-week losing streak. The S&amp;P 500 closed up 1.90% on the week and its first positive week in the last four. The Nasdaq ended the week 2.58% higher.
*****
&gt; Market sentiment got a boost Thursday after Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said he thinks the central bank can keep its interest rate hikes to 25 basis points rather than the half-point increase favored by some other officials.
*****
&gt; However, Fed Governor Christopher J. Waller struck a tougher tone in his comments to the Mid-Size Bank Coalition of America, raising the possibility of a higher terminal rate if inflation numbers don’t cool. He referred to January’s big payrolls report, which showed the economy added 517,000 jobs, as well as the latest reading from the consumer price index and personal consumption expenditures reports.
*****
&gt; “If those data reports continue to come in too hot, the policy target range will have to be raised this year even more to ensure that we do not lose the momentum that was in place before the data for January were released,” Waller said.

&gt; # End of Q1 Impacts March Trading

&gt; Julius Caesar failed to heed the famous warning to “beware the Ides of March” but investors have been served well when they have. Stock prices have had a propensity to decline, sometimes rather precipitously, during the latter days of the month.

&gt; Over the recent 21-year period, March has tended to open well with gains accumulating over its first three trading days. A brief bout of weakness follows before all indexes begin moving modestly higher into mid-month through month’s end.

&gt; March packs a rather busy docket. It is the end of the first quarter, which brings with it Triple Witching and an abundance of portfolio maneuvers from The Street. March Triple-Witching Weeks have been quite bullish in recent years. But the week after is the exact opposite,

&gt; In March 2020, DJIA plunged nearly 4012 points (-17.3%) during the week ending on the 20th. Solid late-March gains in 2009 and again in 2020 have improved average second half of March performance, but most bullish days are still in the first half of the month.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/026df8bfaa21b196c548da2ab3f15364/7be12938549fb36e-93/s500x750/1c7bc831987f228e45891f7acd64888d3f3c6608.jpg))**

*****

&gt; # Sentiment Back to Bearish

&gt; The consistency of declines throughout February and to start the month of March has sent sentiment decisively lower. The latest data from the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) showed 23.4% of respondents reported as bullish, up modestly from 21.6% last week but still down significantly from 34.1% two weeks ago. With less than a quarter of respondents reporting as bullish, bullish sentiment continues to sit firmly below its historical average of 37.5% for a record 67 straight weeks.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/030223-AAII-1.png))**

&gt; Meanwhile, bearish sentiment has continued to grind higher reaching 44.8% after three straight weeks of increases and hitting the highest level of the short year so far.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/030223-AAII-2.png))**

&gt; At the start of February, the bull-bear spread ended its record streak of negative readings as bulls finally outnumbered bears. The surge in pessimism in the past couple of weeks, though, has resulted in more negative bull-bear readings.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/030223-AAII-3.png))**

&gt; In addition to sentiment taking a more bearish tone, far fewer respondents are reporting neutral sentiment. After the highest reading in nearly a year last week, only 31.8% couldn't make up their mind this week. That eight percentage point drop from last week was the largest weekly decline since November.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/030223-AAII-4.png))**

&gt; In addition to the AAII survey, other weekly sentiment readings have likewise made a quick reversal back towards negative sentiment. Combining the readings of the AAII survey with the Investors Intelligence survey and the NAAIM Exposure Index, sentiment has gone from the most cheery outlook in over a year down to pessimism right in line with the rest of the past year. In fact, the 1.36 point decline since the high three weeks ago ranks as the seventh largest decline in such a span since the composite begins in 2006.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/030223-AAII-5.png))**

&gt; Since sentiment is a contrarian indicator, the sharp bearish turn across these sentiment indicators 'should' be a signal for positive forward performance. However, that has not exactly been the case historically. In the table below, we show each prior week that the index has fallen at least 1.25 points without having done so in the prior three months. Of the dozen prior instances, performance has been mixed going forward.

&gt; # Home Prices Falling Fast

&gt; Updated data on home prices across the country came out earlier this week when the newest monthly S&amp;P CoreLogic Case Shiller indices were published. This data is lagged by two months, but it gives us a look at where home prices ended the year in 2022.

&gt; Below is a table highlighting the month-over-month (m/m) and year-over-year (y/y) percentage change in home prices across the 20 cities tracked by Case Shiller. It also includes the national and composite 10-city and 20-city readings.

&gt; Home prices fell sharply from November 2022 to December 2022, with the national index down 0.81% and 11 of 20 cities down more than 1% sequentially. New York and Miami saw the smallest m/m declines with drops of less than 0.3%.

&gt; Looking at y/y price changes, while the national index still showed an increase of 5.76% from December 2021 to December 2022, two cities have now seen prices dip into the red on a y/y basis. Seattle home prices fell 1.78% for the full year 2022, while San Francisco prices fell even more at -4.19%. Given the unrelenting pullback in prices over the last six months, we'll see more and more cities dip into the red on a y/y basis over the next few months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/cstable.png))**

&gt; Where home price trends get interesting is looking at the post-COVID action. In the aftermath of lockdowns, government stimulus, and the shift to ""work from home"" in many parts of the labor force, home prices across the country absolutely soared. By mid-2022, the national home price index was up 45% from the level it was at in February 2020 just before COVID hit. Areas on the West Coast and in the Southeast saw prices rise even more, with many cities seeing gains of more than 60% at their peaks.

&gt; Prices finally peaked last summer, however, as rate hikes by the inflation-fighting Fed quickly pushed mortgage rates to levels not seen in decades. Below is a chart showing how much home prices have fallen from their post-COVID peaks seen in mid-2022. The composite indices are only down 4-6% from their highs, but we've seen prices really take a hit out west with cities like San Diego, Seattle, and San Francisco already down double-digit percentage points.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/postcovidpeak.png))**

&gt; Given the pullbacks in home prices over the past six+ months, below is a look at where prices currently stand relative to their pre-COVID levels at the end of February 2020. Notably, San Francisco -- which has seen prices fall the most from their highs -- is currently up the least since COVID hit with a gain of 23%. Other cities where home prices are up less post-COVID than the national indices include Minneapolis, DC, Chicago, and Portland. Where home prices are still up the most is in Florida as prices in Tampa and Miami are still up 60% or more.

&gt; # March 2023 Almanac: Even Better In Pre-Election Years

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/67b40a5f06c53814c71ebdbd8547790b/e4901a4eac61d1e8-26/s500x750/d2d342cf3a3f3a9d32ce968ca73a4e2268fc3f9a.jpg))**

&gt; As part of the Best Six/Eight Months, March has historically been a solid performing month with DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 &amp; 2000 all advancing more than 63% of the time with average gains ranging from 0.7% by NASDAQ to 1.1% by S&amp;P 500.

&gt; Historically a solid performing month, March performs even better in pre-election years. In pre-election years March ranks: 4th best for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, and Russell 1000 (January, April and December are better). Pre-election year Marchs rank #5 for Russell 2000.

&gt; Pre-election year March has been up 14 out of the last 14 for DJIA. Coming into 2019, the Russell 2000 had a perfect, 10-for-10 winning record, but is now 10 and 1 after falling 2.3% that March. Average pre-election year gains range from 1.8% by DJIA to 3.1% from NASDAQ.

&gt; # One of These Indices Is Not Like the Others

&gt; Looking across the major US index ETFs in our Trend Analyzer, one stands out (in a negative way) from all the others. At the moment, the Dow is the only major US index in the red on a year-to-date basis as we close the books on February. Even more notable, is the fact that it's also the only one below its 50-DMA. Not only is it below its 50-day, but it is trading firmly in oversold territory sitting over 1.5 standard deviations below its 50-day. Today that dynamic of Dow underperformance continues as the index is falling another 0.3% as of this writing while the S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq, and Russell 2,000 are all higher.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/02/022823-50-dma-1a.png))**

&gt; In the chart below, we show how far the S&amp;P 500 and Dow are trading (in standard deviations) from their respective 50-DMAs over the past five years. For the most part, the two large-cap indices have tracked one another relatively well in spite of their differences in composition and price calculations. That makes the current situation in which the Dow is oversold without the same applying to the S&amp;P 500 somewhat unusual, albeit not without precedence. While uncommon, there have been periods in which the indices have similarly distanced themselves from one another like most recently in the spring and fall of 2021.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/02/022823-50-dma-1.png))**

&gt; Although there have been other times in which the Dow and S&amp;P's overbought/oversold readings have deviated from one another, the current example is abnormally large. With a gap of 1.66 standard deviations between the two indices' overbought/oversold readings versus their 50-DMA spreads, today's spread ranks in the bottom 1% of all readings since 1952 when the five-day trading week began. Additionally, such low readings have been exceptionally rare in the past 20 years. Outside of June and September of 2021, August 2015 was the last instance of the spread falling this wide with the Dow underperforming. Looking back even further, 2004 was the only other instance of the past 20 years.

&gt; # Tech Relative Strength Still Negative

&gt; Each day in our Sector Snapshot, we provide updated charts of the relative strength lines of each sector versus the S&amp;P 500. Outside of a brief period last summer, Technology, the largest sector in terms of market cap, has seen its relative strength line sit in negative territory for nearly the whole of the past year. In other words, the broader market has outperformed the Tech sector almost every day for a year straight. In the chart below, we show the one-year relative strength line of Tech versus the S&amp;P going back to 1991. After some of the most dramatic underperformance of the past couple of decades, Tech rebounded, and the sector has now only underperformed the broader market by a little less than 3% in the past year. While Tech's relative strength is not as weak as it once was and is closing in on the first positive readings since the mid-summer, today marks the 131st trading day of consecutive negative readings. That is handily the longest streak in nearly a decade and one of only six other times a streak has eclipsed 100 trading days.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/02/022823-Tech-2.png))**

&gt; The current streak has yet to come to a close, but in the chart below, we show the performance of Tech and the S&amp;P 500 following the conclusion of each of those prior streaks of 100 or more days. Overall, performance does hold a positive bias with positive returns a vast majority of the time. That being said, the average size of those gains is not exactly impressive. In the case of Tech, the average and median gains are smaller than the norm across these time periods. One year out is the starkest difference with an average gain of less than 5% compared to what has typically been a gain that sits in the mid-teens. Likewise, the S&amp;P 500 tends to underperform the norm one year later, but short to medium-term performance is stronger than the norm. Six-month returns, in particular, have been impressive with a move higher every time and an average gain that is more than double that of the typical six-month performance since 1991.

# **Stocks close higher Friday, Dow breaks 4-week losing streak as 10-year Treasury yield retreats: Live updates - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/02/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks rose Friday as Treasury yields eased from their recent highs and investors weighed the cumulative impact from Fed hikes already implemented and digested this week’s comments from the central bank.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 387.40 points, or 1.17%, to 33,390.97. The S&amp;P 500 climbed 1.61% to 4,045.64, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.97% to close at 11,689.01.
*****
&gt; The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury note dipped below the 4% threshold. Traders have been watching 4% as the key level on the 10-year that could trigger another down move in stocks. At times this week when the 10-year rate rose above that point, stocks retreated.
*****
&gt; The 10-year Treasury is a benchmark rate that influences mortgages and car loans, so a breakout in the yield could ripple through the economy.
*****
&gt; “The stock market is very sensitive to bond yields at this point and looking for some respite to the recent upward moves in yields,” said Yung-Yu Ma, BMO Wealth Management chief investment strategist. “There’s a nervous anticipation to upcoming data releases for jobs and inflation after the difficult readings last month. The market is unlikely to have sustained traction until data points resume a cooling trend.”
*****
&gt; All of the major averages notched a winning week. The Dow posted a 1.75% gain and snapped a four-week losing streak. The S&amp;P 500 closed up 1.90% on the week and its first positive week in the last four. The Nasdaq ended the week 2.58% higher.
*****
&gt; Market sentiment got a boost Thursday after Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said he thinks the central bank can keep its interest rate hikes to 25 basis points rather than the half-point increase favored by some other officials.
*****
&gt; However, Fed Governor Christopher J. Waller struck a tougher tone in his comments to the Mid-Size Bank Coalition of America, raising the possibility of a higher terminal rate if inflation numbers don’t cool. He referred to January’s big payrolls report, which showed the economy added 517,000 jobs, as well as the latest reading from the consumer price index and personal consumption expenditures reports.
*****
&gt; “If those data reports continue to come in too hot, the policy target range will have to be raised this year even more to ensure that we do not lose the momentum that was in place before the data for January were released,” Waller said.

&gt; # End of Q1 Impacts March Trading

&gt; Julius Caesar failed to heed the famous warning to “beware the Ides of March” but investors have been served well when they have. Stock prices have had a propensity to decline, sometimes rather precipitously, during the latter days of the month.

&gt; Over the recent 21-year period, March has tended to open well with gains accumulating over its first three trading days. A brief bout of weakness follows before all indexes begin moving modestly higher into mid-month through month’s end.

&gt; March packs a rather busy docket. It is the end of the first quarter, which brings with it Triple Witching and an abundance of portfolio maneuvers from The Street. March Triple-Witching Weeks have been quite bullish in recent years. But the week after is the exact opposite,

&gt; In March 2020, DJIA plunged nearly 4012 points (-17.3%) during the week ending on the 20th. Solid late-March gains in 2009 and again in 2020 have improved average second half of March performance, but most bullish days are still in the first half of the month.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/026df8bfaa21b196c548da2ab3f15364/7be12938549fb36e-93/s500x750/1c7bc831987f228e45891f7acd64888d3f3c6608.jpg))**

&gt; # Sentiment Back to Bearish

&gt; The consistency of declines throughout February and to start the month of March has sent sentiment decisively lower. The latest data from the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) showed 23.4% of respondents reported as bullish, up modestly from 21.6% last week but still down significantly from 34.1% two weeks ago. With less than a quarter of respondents reporting as bullish, bullish sentiment continues to sit firmly below its historical average of 37.5% for a record 67 straight weeks.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/030223-AAII-1.png))**

&gt; Meanwhile, bearish sentiment has continued to grind higher reaching 44.8% after three straight weeks of increases and hitting the highest level of the short year so far.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/030223-AAII-2.png))**

&gt; At the start of February, the bull-bear spread ended its record streak of negative readings as bulls finally outnumbered bears. The surge in pessimism in the past couple of weeks, though, has resulted in more negative bull-bear readings.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/030223-AAII-3.png))**

&gt; In addition to sentiment taking a more bearish tone, far fewer respondents are reporting neutral sentiment. After the highest reading in nearly a year last week, only 31.8% couldn't make up their mind this week. That eight percentage point drop from last week was the largest weekly decline since November.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/030223-AAII-4.png))**

&gt; In addition to the AAII survey, other weekly sentiment readings have likewise made a quick reversal back towards negative sentiment. Combining the readings of the AAII survey with the Investors Intelligence survey and the NAAIM Exposure Index, sentiment has gone from the most cheery outlook in over a year down to pessimism right in line with the rest of the past year. In fact, the 1.36 point decline since the high three weeks ago ranks as the seventh largest decline in such a span since the composite begins in 2006.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/030223-AAII-5.png))**

&gt; Since sentiment is a contrarian indicator, the sharp bearish turn across these sentiment indicators 'should' be a signal for positive forward performance. However, that has not exactly been the case historically. In the table below, we show each prior week that the index has fallen at least 1.25 points without having done so in the prior three months. Of the dozen prior instances, performance has been mixed going forward.

&gt; # Home Prices Falling Fast

&gt; Updated data on home prices across the country came out earlier this week when the newest monthly S&amp;P CoreLogic Case Shiller indices were published. This data is lagged by two months, but it gives us a look at where home prices ended the year in 2022.

&gt; Below is a table highlighting the month-over-month (m/m) and year-over-year (y/y) percentage change in home prices across the 20 cities tracked by Case Shiller. It also includes the national and composite 10-city and 20-city readings.

&gt; Home prices fell sharply from November 2022 to December 2022, with the national index down 0.81% and 11 of 20 cities down more than 1% sequentially. New York and Miami saw the smallest m/m declines with drops of less than 0.3%.

&gt; Looking at y/y price changes, while the national index still showed an increase of 5.76% from December 2021 to December 2022, two cities have now seen prices dip into the red on a y/y basis. Seattle home prices fell 1.78% for the full year 2022, while San Francisco prices fell even more at -4.19%. Given the unrelenting pullback in prices over the last six months, we'll see more and more cities dip into the red on a y/y basis over the next few months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/cstable.png))**

&gt; Where home price trends get interesting is looking at the post-COVID action. In the aftermath of lockdowns, government stimulus, and the shift to ""work from home"" in many parts of the labor force, home prices across the country absolutely soared. By mid-2022, the national home price index was up 45% from the level it was at in February 2020 just before COVID hit. Areas on the West Coast and in the Southeast saw prices rise even more, with many cities seeing gains of more than 60% at their peaks.

&gt; Prices finally peaked last summer, however, as rate hikes by the inflation-fighting Fed quickly pushed mortgage rates to levels not seen in decades. Below is a chart showing how much home prices have fallen from their post-COVID peaks seen in mid-2022. The composite indices are only down 4-6% from their highs, but we've seen prices really take a hit out west with cities like San Diego, Seattle, and San Francisco already down double-digit percentage points.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/postcovidpeak.png))**

&gt; Given the pullbacks in home prices over the past six+ months, below is a look at where prices currently stand relative to their pre-COVID levels at the end of February 2020. Notably, San Francisco -- which has seen prices fall the most from their highs -- is currently up the least since COVID hit with a gain of 23%. Other cities where home prices are up less post-COVID than the national indices include Minneapolis, DC, Chicago, and Portland. Where home prices are still up the most is in Florida as prices in Tampa and Miami are still up 60% or more.

&gt; # Tech Relative Strength Still Negative

&gt; Each day in our Sector Snapshot, we provide updated charts of the relative strength lines of each sector versus the S&amp;P 500.

100,SOUN,Red Week Incoming!,"#  SPY Analysis

 A lot of constructive action going on here in the higher time frames of the SPY. On the weekly chart, we can see several things which started to change the tide. We’ve begun to make higher lows on the weekly chart and have set our first higher high in a long time. The week of the 12/19 candle set a new swing pivot low and the week of 1/30 took out that 410 level which we’ve had trouble pushing through since April 2022.

We’ve also got a bit of confluence going with a break of the 200EMA on the daily chart and the weekly downtrend. That’s three checks in our favor from a technical standpoint that look good if we can continue to hold these levels. 

The main thing I’d like to see here from a bit more of a macro view is any future swing low set above 380. I do think it’s possible we pull back below this 410 level as well as 200EMA etc. Any swing low set over 380 however keeps the bull thesis intact and keeps us moving in the right direction.

However, if that scenario were to play out then our next move to support the bull thesis in a strong manner would be a a higher higher over 418 and a firm hold of this 410 level. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kwnjzc7jitha1.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b36f099e6cf07e881b761b65251637aec68f6ee

 

We can see here on a smaller time frame how key this 410 level has been the past year. It was first held back in March 22’ with authority and then saw a rally to 462 which is our current 52 week high. From there it has been macro lower highs and lower lows. Every time we have traded back to 410 we’ve been met with supply. It’s not a perfect line in the sane but you can visually see where it was attempted to hold above and failed 5 times prior. 

Now that we are back over 410 I think there’s a good chance that we see a move back to the downside and this isn’t the magical trend line break everyone must be thinking that ignites a new bull market. 

Any pullback here into the low 390s and at the very most &gt; 380 would be deemed constructive. I’d like to see some sort of move held around 390 - 395 and base there a bit before we make another move back to 410 with our most recent lower high in place to retest at 418. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8zf0f5lmitha1.png?width=1468&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb0012f6fe8a7ee27a9b05491450f133f2999e6c

 

The shorter term trend within the last 3 months is without a doubt up. The trend line on the 4HR chart below is set from the market rally starting in October 2022. From here we see consistent higher highs and higher lows with our only failure being in mid December at the 410 level.

We’ve held higher and grinded back to that level now, not setting a lower high at 410 but assuring we got the liquidity that was set above that 414 high in December.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/huwco15pitha1.png?width=1468&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d7bb905db0206093f8b7ee1cd97747e58aeb14a

 

Viewing the action more closely since we’ve tapped that liquidity at 414 we’ve been visually weaker. On Feb 2nd when pushing to 418 I started getting some texts about the “bull market being back” so taking that as a hint on where the crowd is learning.

Notice the volume surge on our push into the liquidity area as well. Since then we’ve begun setting lower highs and lower lows. With a clear fail under 410 towards the end of this past week.

This has me leaning towards a further pullback sooner rather than later. I think the next move will be down and we will roll over this demand around 403-404 that was formed for the push to 410+. With that being said, if we do roll over and fail that demand zone then 395-400 will more than likely come quickly within a week of failing that zone.

It is possible that we base here for a few days and make a shot at a move higher. If that’s the case, watch closely how price reacts in the 410-415 area. If toppy and is clearly selling this would be a great area to get a short position. 

The real move here that can create a substantial move to the upside is a significant push through 420 on volume squeezing shorts out. The only thing is the probabilities of this given the multi-month rally, February seasonality, and topping signs in the main liquidity zone seem rather low.

### Strongest Sector

The Energy sector remains visually the strongest sector at the moment. Really the only sector in a clear up trend and within striking distance of its ATH. We’re now flagging out here on the weekly chart here and getting tighter. If we see a further market rally this year then this is primed to set new ATHs.

&amp;#x200B;

Furthering this, the financial sector in my opinion looks the most poised for money to flow into if there were to be a new favored sector. Reclaiming its neckline and setting consecutive higher lows. As long as 35.50 holds then could see some inflows. 

&amp;#x200B;

 Looking away from the charts we can see that the Tech, Utilities, and Health Care sectors have reported the least amount of earnings misses so far. 

&amp;#x200B;

### Macro News and Themes

The current overall momentum theme sector-wise has been AI talk. We’ve seen the ticker $AI running and creating momentum in the small cap space forming sympathy plays.

The theme seems to have originated from the overall hype of the ChatGPT launch or relaunch, seeing within a week of numerous shit co’s tagging ChatGPT in their headlines.

Furthering this in the overall markets, we’re in the middle of the Earnings Season. It seems that profits are starting to shrink amid inflation and a rough future outlook on market direction.

At a quick glance, it seems that there a lot of strong earnings gaps but the following days result in profit taking. This could be profit taking as the multi-month rally becomes toppy.

 Also worth noting is the seasonality this time of the year tends to bring which is a bearish tilt.

Lastly, upcoming Economic Data. The calendar this week is pretty busy. The main watch for me is the CPI report. I feel that this will act as a catalyst for our next directional move.

### Big Trades Setting Up

The biggest trade going into the week is the CPI numbers and the directional trade that’s likely to come into the markets afterward. A lot of variables stacking up at the moment that is tilting towards the next move being down so will be interesting to see if CPI is the catalyst to get that done. 

With a busy earnings week coming up, any stocks releasing great reports + guidance are always a notable watch.

As far as momentum names setting up BBAI, AI, and SOUN are still within trend. We already had profit taking days there and temporary tops are in place but wouldn’t be the craziest thing in the world to see another leg higher. I feel if that were the case then it’d be a true hype sector move where we see multiple legs. 

Not really seeing many Large Caps either at the moment. Seems that all the stocks which were on significant runs are now on the backside of their move. Names being CVNA, COIN, NVDA &amp; TSLA.
