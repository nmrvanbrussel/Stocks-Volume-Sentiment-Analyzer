1,AAPL,Eli Lilly becomes the first pharma to hit a 1 trillion dollar market cap on booming weight loss drug demand. LLY is +30% over the past month,"No paywall: [https://www.investors.com/news/technology/eli-lilly-trillion-dollar-club-tech-companies/](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/eli-lilly-trillion-dollar-club-tech-companies/)

&gt;Eli Lilly (LLY) became the first health care company to top $1 trillion in market capitalization on Friday, joining an exclusive club that includes big tech names like Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL) and [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com) (AMZN).

&gt;Shares rose as high at 1,061.17 in early action, tipping Lilly's market cap just north of $1 trillion for the first time. Eli Lilly stock closed 2% higher at 1,059.70, keeping its market cap in the 13-digit club.

&gt;According to CNBC, Lilly is the second non-tech name to reach the $1 trillion club in the U.S., following Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB).

&gt;Eli Lilly Stock's Comeback

&gt;Eli Lilly shares are making an impressive comeback, rising 35% this year after the drugmaker inked a deal with the Trump administration to sell its weight-loss drug, Zepbound, for a lower price on the new direct-to-consumer website, TrumpRx. The deal also includes a provision for Eli Lilly to sell Zepbound and Mounjaro, its diabetes powerhouse, to Medicare at a significant discount.

&gt;Rather than hurt Lilly's top line, experts say the move will expand the market, adding new patients who couldn't otherwise afford the popular drugs.

&gt;""The market penetration of these drugs in weight loss is still fairly low, and in diabetes, where it's higher, it's still low,"" Brad Stewart, an executive with the advisory firm BDO, recently told Investor's Business Daily. ""There's still a tremendous opportunity from growth just purely from additional patients.""

&gt;Lilly Shares Hit A Record High

&gt;Lilly stock has a perfect IBD Digital Composite Rating of 99. The 1-99 score pits a stock's fundamental and technical measures against all other stocks. On this measure, Eli Lilly stock outranks 99% of stocks, regardless of industry group.

&gt;Shares broke out of a lengthy consolidation with a buy point at 972.53. That entry represents the stock's previous record high, dating back to August 2024. Lilly stock has since blown well past that mark. The stock is now about 8% above its entry, north of the buy zone.

&gt;The strength is represented in Eli Lilly stock's 93 Relative Strength Rating, a measure of a stock's 12-month performance relative to all other stocks.

&gt;Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported slowing growth in monthly revenue, highlighting uncertainty over the sustainability of the AI boom even as industry behemoths including Nvidia Corp. chase more chip supplies.

&gt;The company posted a 16.9% rise in sales for October, the slowest pace since February 2024. Analysts on average are expecting sales to increase 16% in the current quarter. TSMC’s American depository receipts were up as much as 3% in pre-market trading.

&gt;Industry executives remain buoyant about AI-driven growth as major tech firms are accelerating investments in data centers. The TSMC revenue gain also just covers just a single month of business, offering investors less insight.

&gt;Investors were jolted last week by a sudden slump in Asia’s technology shares, which served as a stark reminder that the world-beating rally in artificial intelligence and semiconductor stocks may be nearing a short-term crest. Wall Street chief executives have warned of an overdue market correction, with Michael Burry’s Scion Asset Management also disclosing bearish wagers on Nvidia.

&gt;That’s despite massive ample spending plans from leading AI players.

&gt;Meta Platforms Inc., Alphabet Inc., [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com) Inc. and Microsoft Corp. will collectively spend more than $400 billion to fund an AI buildout next year, a 21% hike from 2025, to secure leadership in the race in emerging technologies.

&gt;Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang of Nvidia, which is the primary AI chip supplier to major companies, said on Saturday his business is “growing month by month, stronger and stronger.”

&gt;Huang met TSMC Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei and asked for more chip supplies during his two-day whirlwind trip to Taiwan this time when major chip designers are all chasing limited supplies from the Hsinchu-based company.

&gt;TSMC is also the go-to chipmaker for the Santa Clara, California-based firm’s competitors including Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Qualcomm Inc., and it makes Apple Inc.’s silicon for iPhones and other gadgets.

&gt;Huang’s optimism is shared by his rivals. Qualcomm Chief Executive Officer Cristiano Amon told Bloomberg TV last week that the world is underestimating how big AI will get.

5,AAPL,Abaxx Technologies: Newest Clearing House and Exchange with Massive Upside,"This is gonna be a longish post. Potential for more than a 50x maybe even +100x but that's extremely hopeful. It has digital identity, digital assets, T+0 settlement, digital gold, tokenized stocks, exchange and clearinghouse.

The stock just hit 1 billion USD market cap so I can finally post about it here.

**TLDR:** 10x in 1-2 years, 50x within 5 years.

New high tech globally recognized and licensed clearinghouse/exchange that is integrating their new digital identity with digital title ownership that has legal finality. Basically merging better tech than CRCL ($30 billion MC) with better tech than CME ($95 billion MC) to unlock a 42 trillion dollar industry.

First you have to understand, that commodity clearinghouses and exchanges are worth ALOT of money. Here is all the publicly listed ones. Very few exist. Notice Abaxx at the bottom worth 1 billion.  


|Clearing|Parent Company|Stock Ticker|Market Capitalization (Nov 2025)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|CME Clearing|CME Group Inc.|CME (NASDAQ)|\~$93 billion|
|LCH.Clearnet|London Stock Exchange Group plc (LSEG)|LSEG.L|\~$49 billion|

|Clearstream|Deutsche Börse AG|[DB1.DE](http://DB1.DE)|\~$47 billion|
|Abaxx Clearing|Abaxx Technologies Inc.|ABXX (NEO) / ABXXF (OTCQX)|\~$1 billion|



The problem lately is that the big ones have been ignoring industry requests for physically delivered contracts. Now they just launch financially settled contracts which are mostly products for traders not commodity companies which need physical delivery.

Also you have LBMA that trades metals like nickel. Remember when LBMA reversed nickel trades for a their Chinese trader because he was caught with his pants down?

So industry is ready for another exchange and a clearinghouse that will fix these issues. Many have come to Abaxx for this.

Now in comes Abaxx exchange and clearinghouse. Their focus has been physically delivered that are being requested by industry. They have launched LNG, Carbon, Nickel, Lithium, and Gold. LNG and Gold could easily be worth billions each. The others worth hundreds of millions. This is just what they launched so far. They plan to launch much more like weather derivatives likely to come this year still.

Abaxx LNG physically delivered contract is already set to replace the financially settled JKM LNG contract (which generates over 100+ million in revenue) as it is better in all aspects due to physically delivered nature.

I[n June JKM reported 128,000 lots traded. In November, Abaxx had 9,529 lots traded across its LNG contracts. So already 7.4% of the trading.](https://x.com/James_Duade/status/1984588708444598605) Not a equal comparison month comparison, but just a rough idea. All without US trading firms while Abaxx gets approval to support US clients (CFTC Approval expected after lockdown is over). They are regulated out of Singapore which the US already sees as equivalent, they just need the final sign off. As Abaxx volumes grows, traders will need to trade their LNG out of necessity. As it continues to grow, risk management will require Abaxx LNG physically delivered contracts, again out of necessity.

I suspect Abaxx will overtake JKM in 2026 and make it essentially worthless. Abaxx's LNG contracts alone will likely be worth 5-10 billion USD creating a pretty good safety buffer at a 5x from here.

Abaxx is also piloting tech with Minehub to let traders us LNG shipments on water as collateral in their futures exchange. This will be expanded out to all their futures markets on success and will also allow traders to use their gold as collateral with much better rates.

Their gold futures contract is also gaining traction. They are likely to launch gold spot this month as well with a similar system set up for silver next month. Maybe even this month as well.

For those unaware of the gold markets, New York is the futures market and London is the spot market. Which means traders have to physically ship gold bars in a plane to meet delivery. And the gold bars are different sizes (so need a smelter) and in different legal jurisdictions.

Abaxx Gold market (and soon silver) will have futures and spot take delivery in the same location, same legal jurisdiction and same gold bar sizes which are also smaller and easier to trade. There is significant efficiencies here which will likely act as a liquidity blackhole for all precious metals markets.

**Digital Cheques**

Abaxx has announced the pilot launch of their own digital cheques for money market funds that transfer instantly. (I want to avoid that cursed word stable coin because Abaxx has nothing to do with that industry). But Abaxx's tech is better. It’s completely private with legal finality. For those bullish on Circle/Tokenization, just know that banks and companies are never gonna adopt stablecoins on a public ledger that can be all tracked by your favourite three letter agency or competitors. Don't get be even started on counterparty risk of those products. It is a product for retail only.

Abaxx exchange and clearing house was built from the ground up with this technology integrated into the exchange. Which means they will use it for instant money transfers and instant T+0 settlement. I can’t emphasize enough what T+0 settlement means for liquidity and trading. It also unlocks the ability for LNG traders to collateralize their trades with gold for example. Nothing more annoying than wanting to trade something but you have to wait several business days for funds to clear or pay interest to get immediate access.

The same technology they are also planning to bring to stocks allowing for instant settlement and trading. And if you are paying attention, it’s connected to a regulated clearinghouse and exchange. One of the most regulated customers they will ever have. When they eventually launch a currency trading platform, you can have instant international wire transfers that are routed through a currency exchange to get the current exchange rate and have it instantly settle. None of these $50 wire transfers with awful exchange rates that takes 3 days to arrive in your account.

I would dare to say they are building the entire ecosystem needed to bypass the swift network. Think of it like an Apple ecosystem. You use swift to get into it by wiring money to their custodians ([which Abaxx also launched and is using it for their carbon markets](https://x.com/JoshCrumb/status/1964042716083364164) ), but once inside, you have access to instant money transfers, clearinghouse and exchange, stock markets, commodities, and forex. So Abaxx is building the Apple equivalent for the global financial system.

Abaxx will also be focusing on bringing 42 Trillion worth of MMFs and Gold to the digital world next year while taking 5 basis points ($21 billion revenue potential) to do so yearly as well as some transaction fees. Obviously they won't get everything. But several of their partners and investors manage already trillions of MMF and appear to like the product. [Their investors control +50% of the MMF funds in USA.](https://x.com/JosephTMetcalf/status/1973059584915898697)

**Digital Identity**

Okay so behind all their is their ID++ which is their digital identity. It’s all private and encrypted and you use it with the exchange. The Exchange will perform KYC on you and issue credentials. These credentials you use to sign your trades and money transfers. It’s built in a way that you can grant access to portions of it as needed. If you need to sign up for a platform thats needs to KYC you, you grant access to only a certain portion your digital identity on a limited basis. Then you can revoke their access and no longer have access to your documents so you don’t have to be exposed to data hacks on every platform you sign up on. It is built with all the latest digital identity standards like w3 but it's also self sovereign which means you control your identity and its not issued by a government entity. The end goal being is that governments would issue credentials independently to your id and create a ""chain"" of verified credentials. Universities as well for example would issue your grad certificates so you can verify it instantly if someone ever required. But you retain full control of it.

The point here isn't so much what it does though, but what it unlocks. Abaxx uses this for their clearing activities and is one of their secret sauces that helps them instantly clear their transactions.

**Graded Commodities**

Going back to the exchange, Abaxx will also be launching graded commodities. For example different levels of copper grading based on metadata which allows you track carbon emissions or anything else needed. Currently nothing like it exists and will be done through their Minehub partnership.

It would prevent electric car companies saying their technology is clean while importing cobalt that was mined from forced labour in Africa. With Abaxx you could get premiums on commodities that were mined cleanly and ethically.

Regulations for carbon emissions are also starting to pick up pace. Countries are introducing legislation requiring scope 3 emissions reporting (aka higher up the supply chain). Australia, Brazil, California, Canada, Hong Kong, New Zealand, Singapore, Europe, and USA are all introducing legislation that require commodity supply chain tracking for source of origin, forced labour monitoring, or carbon emissions.

This information is not available on current exchanges making them a black box. Abaxx will launch graded versions of these commodities that include metadata that tracks the commodity through its entire supply chain.

I could go on but I'll stop it here. I am already at \~4x since i have been buying this stock for a while and just averaging in the entire time. I think it could be $100 billion+ company but the reasoning why would require a second more in depth DD. I can do it if there is enough interest. But based what I said already i think $50 billion is a good limit. If I am right, I see no reason to ever sell this company so I will be holding indefinitely. You can only buy stock on CBOE in Canada, OTC in USA (Sorry robinhood users, get literally any other broker), and on Frankfurt exchange as well.

[Cantor just put a price target of $81 CAD on it](https://www.investing.com/news/analyst-ratings/cantor-fitzgerald-initiates-abaxx-technologies-stock-with-overweight-rating-93CH-4318669). So industry backed 2x if you have less risk tolerance and don't quite yet see the vision. That price target only accounts for exchange angle and doesn't account for their tech which is significantly higher. This stock is forward looking and revenues are just now starting to pick up. Hence the recent surge in stock price.

[Here is a in depth video highlighting how it could be worth hundreds of billions. Video is 1hr and 20 min long. ](https://youtu.be/go0bc0K4UdQ?si=LrN3VQdKGw0wwdfW) He runs a family office and he works with the team as sort of a liaison trying to connect sellers with institutions wanting to buy in size so obviously a bit of bias. At the same time though, after having done lots of research myself, you will start to realize that the exchange and clearinghouse (worth tens of billions on its own) is actually just one portion of what they are trying to build. Hence my example of the Apple like ecosystem.

Will answer any questions as best I can.

When they eventually launch a currency trading platform, you can have instant international wire transfers that are routed through a currency exchange to get the current exchange rate and have it instantly settle. None of these $50 wire transfers with awful exchange rates that takes 3 days to arrive in your account.

I would dare to say they are building the entire ecosystem needed to bypass the swift network. Think of it like an Apple ecosystem. You use swift to get into it by wiring money to their custodians ([which Abaxx also launched and is using it for their carbon markets](https://x.com/JoshCrumb/status/1964042716083364164) ), but once inside, you have access to instant money transfers, clearinghouse and exchange, stock markets, commodities, and forex. So Abaxx is building the Apple equivalent for the global financial system.

Abaxx will also be focusing on bringing 42 Trillion worth of MMFs and Gold to the digital world next year while taking 5 basis points ($21 billion revenue potential) to do so yearly as well as some transaction fees. Obviously they won't get everything. But several of their partners and investors manage already trillions of MMF and appear to like the product. [Their investors control +50% of the MMF funds in USA.](https://x.com/JosephTMetcalf/status/1973059584915898697)

**Digital Identity**

Okay so behind all their is their ID++ which is their digital identity. It’s all private and encrypted and you use it with the exchange. The Exchange will perform KYC on you and issue credentials. These credentials you use to sign your trades and money transfers. It’s built in a way that you can grant access to portions of it as needed. If you need to sign up for a platform thats needs to KYC you, you grant access to only a certain portion your digital identity on a limited basis. Then you can revoke their access and no longer have access to your documents so you don’t have to be exposed to data hacks on every platform you sign up on. It is built with all the latest digital identity standards like w3 but it's also self sovereign which means you control your identity and its not issued by a government entity. The end goal being is that governments would issue credentials independently to your id and create a ""chain"" of verified credentials. Universities as well for example would issue your grad certificates so you can verify it instantly if someone ever required. But you retain full control of it.

The point here isn't so much what it does though, but what it unlocks. Abaxx uses this for their clearing activities and is one of their secret sauces that helps them instantly clear their transactions.

**Graded Commodities**

Going back to the exchange, Abaxx will also be launching graded commodities. For example different levels of copper grading based on metadata which allows you track carbon emissions or anything else needed. Currently nothing like it exists and will be done through their Minehub partnership.

It would prevent electric car companies saying their technology is clean while importing cobalt that was mined from forced labour in Africa. With Abaxx you could get premiums on commodities that were mined cleanly and ethically.

Regulations for carbon emissions are also starting to pick up pace. Countries are introducing legislation requiring scope 3 emissions reporting (aka higher up the supply chain). Australia, Brazil, California, Canada, Hong Kong, New Zealand, Singapore, Europe, and USA are all introducing legislation that require commodity supply chain tracking for source of origin, forced labour monitoring, or carbon emissions.

This information is not available on current exchanges making them a black box. Abaxx will launch graded versions of these commodities that include metadata that tracks the commodity through its entire supply chain.

I could go on but I'll stop it here. I am already at \~4x since i have been buying this stock for a while and just averaging in the entire time. I think it could be $100 billion+ company but the reasoning why would require a second more in depth DD. I can do it if there is enough interest. But based what I said already i think $50 billion is a good limit. If I am right, I see no reason to ever sell this company so I will be holding indefinitely. You can only buy stock on CBOE in Canada, OTC in USA (Sorry robinhood users, get literally any other broker), and on Frankfurt exchange as well.

[Cantor just put a price target of $81 CAD on it](https://www.investing.com/news/analyst-ratings/cantor-fitzgerald-initiates-abaxx-technologies-stock-with-overweight-rating-93CH-4318669). So industry backed 2x if you have less risk tolerance and don't quite yet see the vision. That price target only accounts for exchange angle and doesn't account for their tech which is significantly higher. This stock is forward looking and revenues are just now starting to pick up. Hence the recent surge in stock price.

[Here is a in depth video highlighting how it could be worth hundreds of billions. Video is 1hr and 20 min long. ](https://youtu.be/go0bc0K4UdQ?si=LrN3VQdKGw0wwdfW) He runs a family office and he works with the team as sort of a liaison trying to connect sellers with institutions wanting to buy in size so obviously a bit of bias. At the same time though, after having done lots of research myself, you will start to realize that the exchange and clearinghouse (worth tens of billions on its own) is actually just one portion of what they are trying to build. Hence my example of the Apple like ecosystem.

Will answer any questions as best I can.

9,AAPL,Quantum Computing Inc $QUBT fraud,"**Reposted with positions. Mods removed it because it had no positions (I replied with my positions to a comment asking for them).**

My background: I'm a graduate student and researcher in quantum complexity theory. I'm not a hardware engineer, but I do follow developments in quantum hardware closely. Based on my analysis, I have serious concerns that QUBT’s claims may amount to fraud.

[Positions](https://i.imgur.com/cxvZaJa.jpeg). I fully believe that the stock of this [beverage-company-turned-quantum-computing](https://i.imgur.com/Ndz0r8p.png) should go to $0 (or close to it) and it is only a matter of time before it does.

I will split this post into a few parts. First, we will review their fundamentals. Then, we will look into their future claims. Finally, we will review any contracts and future prospects.

**1)** **Fundamentals.** The market cap of QUBT is $3.73 billion and for the three-month period ending June 30, 2025, QUBT reported revenues of $61,000 (yes, you read that right), a decrease from the $183,000 generated in the same quarter of the previous year. They do not have a P/E ratio, as they are unprofitable (you could think that their P/E ratio is high and negative). This means that they have an enterprise value of roughly $3.38 billion which comes almost entirely from their market cap and with a revenue of $263k, their EV/revenue ratio is 12.870. To put it into perspective how extreme that is: 


Company | Enterprise Value/Revenue
-------|------------------------
QUBT | 12870
IONQ | 419
GOOGL | 8
RDDT | 20

If you think RDDT is inflated, then QUBT is roughly 643 more inflated.
Equivalently, RDDT's price would be $137,602 with QUBT's ratio.
This isn't just a premium or hopeium, this is complete detachment from any financial logic or reality.

The company's operational model is a financial black hole. While generating almost no income, its operating expenses nearly doubled year-over-year to $10.2 million for the quarter, resulting in a $10.2 million operating loss. That means the company spent over $167 for every single dollar it made in revenue. The bottom line was a net loss of $36.5 million for the quarter.

QUBT's narrative is that it's a pioneer in one of the most capital-intensive R&amp;D races in human history. Yet, its R&amp;D investment totaled $6.0 million. To compare, [Google and IBM are forming partnerships to pour $150 million into university research alone](https://thequantuminsider.com/2023/05/19/ibm-and-google-join-forces-invest-150-million-in-quantum-computing-research-at-us-and-japanese-universities/), with their internal budgets estimated to be in the billions. How can QUBT possibly compete, let alone innovate, when its R&amp;D budget is a rounding error for its serious competitors?

**2)** **Their future plan.** [This is straight from their presentation.](https://i.imgur.com/p0L9RhX.png) For 2025, they claim ""Early revenues primarily from early adopters."" This is their present reality: microscopic revenues. For 2026-2027, they project ""High-margin revenue from first mover advantage"" and ""Strong pipeline conversion."" These are classic, undefined marketing terms. What constitutes ""high-margin""? 20%? 80%? How much revenue? A million dollars? A hundred million? The lack of any figures makes these claims meaningless. There is no way to measure their performance or hold them accountable. They have no viable plan to get an advantage.
In 2028, the goal is ""Sales Growth =&gt; Market Growth."" This is a generic corporate objective, not a financial forecast. It's a promise to perform well in an undefined future market.

They sell something they call the DIRAC-3, which is an analog quantum annealer. It is not a universal quantum computer capable of running a wide range of algorithms. Its sole function is to find approximate solutions in a a narrow category of optimization problems. In practice, its actual use is almost certainly confined to experimental and research settings. The buyers are not businesses looking to solve their core operational issues, but rather academic institutions or corporate R&amp;D labs that are exploring novel computing architectures. For these niche customers, the DIRAC-3 serves as a piece of laboratory equipment to test theories, publish papers, and perhaps make small claims in quantum-adjacent research. The almost non-existent revenue confirms that it is not being deployed for any meaningful commercial or production-level task.

The primary reason a research group might acquire a DIRAC-3 has little to do with solving a pressing business problem better than a classical computer. Its appeal lies in its novelty and convenience. The machine's use of ""qudits"" and its analog architecture makes it a fun object of academic study at the very best. In essence, someone would want the DIRAC-3 not because it provides a superior solution, but because it is a comparatively cheap tool for exploration and playing around, not a tool for production.

The future prospects for the DIRAC-3 appear exceptionally bleak. It is trapped in a brutally competitive field and it has failed to demonstrate a decisive advantage. To be commercially viable, it must solve a specific, high-value optimization problem significantly faster or cheaper than the highly-refined classical software that has been developed over decades. There is zero evidence that it can do this, and it will never be able to do so. Its potential market is being squeezed from both sides: classical optimization algorithms continue to improve, while the slow but steady progress of true universal quantum computers (i.e. by Google and IBM) threaten to make such intermediate devices obsolete. The DIRAC-3's most probable fate is to become a technological footnote. It is an interesting but ultimately unsuccessful architectural experiment that never found a problem it could solve well enough to justify its own existence in the commercial world.

They make some claims of what they ""will develop"":

First is the Photonic Intelligent Unit (PIU), or ""Reservoir Computer,"" which is being marketed as a revolutionary device for ""compute at the edge"" and Artificial Intelligence. This is straight up misleading and the reality is that reservoir computing is a highly obscure, academic niche even amongst researchers. It has zero commercial adoption. The AI market is not asking for this and it never will, not even in 20 years. AI is built around GPUs and specialized AI chips from NVIDIA, Google, and Apple. The notion that QUBT's niche device, based on a fringe computing model, could make even the smallest dent in this market is laughable. It is a solution in search of a problem, a research gadget being passed off as a commercial AI accelerator. Its only potential customers are a handful of academics, not the enterprises driving the AI revolution. I fully believe they only included the word ""AI"" as a buzzword to attract and scam more investors into their sham of a company.

Next is the Quantum Cyber Module (QCM), which promises ""unconditional security at chip scale"" and is supposedly destined for ""cell phones."" This is pure fantasy. At its core, this device is likely just a Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG), a piece of hardware that has been around for years. While useful for specific cryptographic applications, the market is small, and established competitors like ID Quantique have dominated it for over a decade. The claim of putting this technology into a cell phone is absurd. The cost, size, and marginal benefit over existing cryptographic algorithms make it a non-starter for any mass-market device. It is a commodity component being dressed up in a superhero costume of ""unconditional security"" to attract investors who are fearful of cyber threats but ignorant of the actual technology.

Finally, the company claims to have a ""Quantum Intelligent Sensing Module"" (QISM) focused on LiDAR applications, boasting ""unparalleled detection accuracy."" This is, perhaps, the most ridiculous claim of all (and they have made a lot of crazy claims!). Consider heavily-funded companies like Luminar and Velodyne fighting for razor-thin margins and massive automotive and defense contracts. These companies have invested billions in manufacturing scale, supply chains, and industry partnerships. QUBT has none of this. Their supposed technological edge (single-photon detection) is a known technique with its own significant drawbacks, not a magic bullet. They are entering a market with a lab prototype and a marketing slogan. Their sensing platform has no viable path to commercialization and stands zero chance against the alternatives.

In conclusion, these other ""gadgets"" are not serious products. Each one is a lab-level prototype, carefully branded with the buzzwords of a hot industry (AI, cybersecurity, autonomous vehicles) to create the illusion of a diversified, high-tech portfolio. In reality, none of these products have a credible path to generating meaningful revenue or competing in their respective markets.

**3) Lawsuits and future contracts.** QUBT is now facing multiple securities class-action lawsuits that accuse the company and its leadership of securities fraud. The allegation is that QUBT deliberately misled investors through a series of false statements and material omissions designed to artificially inflate its stock price.

A central point in the lawsuits is the systematic misrepresentation of its relationship with NASA. The company presented itself as a key strategic partner, implying its technology was integral to the space agency's operations. The lawsuits allege this was a calculated falsehood. In reality, the company had only received a few minor Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grants. These are common, low-value awards and do not represent a major strategic partnership. The plaintiffs argue that QCi improperly used the NASA brand to create a false impression of credibility and technological validation. In fact, you would be surprised how easy a company can get one of these contracts. The NASA Phase I grants QCi received were for approximately $125,000 to $150,000 each. It's the financial equivalent of a student receiving a $1,000 university grant to work on a science fair project, and then telling investors they have a major strategic partnership with the university to revolutionize the field.

The legal complaints further allege that the company created a false narrative of commercial readiness. While executives claimed to have market-ready products like the DIRAC-3 and a significant sales pipeline, the company's public financial filings reported negligible revenue. This data is presented as direct evidence that the commercial operations described to investors were a fiction. The lawsuits contend that the company was not a viable business but was merely pretending to be one to support its inflated market valuation.

Finally, the lawsuits claim that QCi made unsupported statements about its technological superiority, including achieving ""quantum advantage,"" without providing the necessary scientific proof. The plaintiffs argue that these were not good-faith claims but were technical jargon used to intentionally mislead investors who could not independently verify their accuracy. These legal actions now pose a direct threat to the company's operational stability, demanding millions in legal fees, consuming management's focus, and causing irreversible damage to its reputation.

**4) My personal note.** The field of quantum computing and its adjacent disciplines is still in its embryonic stage. It is a very active research field with a lot of math to discover, but hardware progress is extremely slow and there are no signs that it will speed up any time soon. 
Any prospect of a profitable, commercial quantum computing business remains decades away. A conservative estimate would place the timeline for consistent profitability at 20 years or more, and even then, it will only be achieved by the organization that makes fundamental breakthroughs in research. That level of discovery will not come from an underfunded startup with a negligible R&amp;D budget; it will almost certainly emerge from major research universities and/or Google and IBM. They possess scientific talent required to solve the hardest problems in science, QUBT does not.

Given this context, the valuations attached to companies like Quantum Computing Inc. are fundamentally absurd. They are not based in any recognizable financial or scientific reality. The claims made by the company's leadership are not merely optimistic; they are so far removed from the current state of the art that no credible expert in the field would support them. This disconnect is so severe that it transcends poor business strategy and enters the realm of potential securities fraud. When a company's public statements and valuation are in such stark opposition to the consensus of the scientific community, it raises serious questions that demand investigation by the appropriate financial authorities to determine if investors were willfully deceived.",730,304,1761402116.0,2025-10-25T14:21:56+00:00,t3_1ofsrr8,"Quantum Computing Inc $QUBT fraud **Reposted with positions.

Consider heavily-funded companies like Luminar and Velodyne fighting for razor-thin margins and massive automotive and defense contracts. These companies have invested billions in manufacturing scale, supply chains, and industry partnerships. QUBT has none of this. Their supposed technological edge (single-photon detection) is a known technique with its own significant drawbacks, not a magic bullet. They are entering a market with a lab prototype and a marketing slogan. Their sensing platform has no viable path to commercialization and stands zero chance against the alternatives.

In conclusion, these other ""gadgets"" are not serious products. Each one is a lab-level prototype, carefully branded with the buzzwords of a hot industry (AI, cybersecurity, autonomous vehicles) to create the illusion of a diversified, high-tech portfolio. In reality, none of these products have a credible path to generating meaningful revenue or competing in their respective markets.

**3) Lawsuits and future contracts.** QUBT is now facing multiple securities class-action lawsuits that accuse the company and its leadership of securities fraud. The allegation is that QUBT deliberately misled investors through a series of false statements and material omissions designed to artificially inflate its stock price.

A central point in the lawsuits is the systematic misrepresentation of its relationship with NASA. The company presented itself as a key strategic partner, implying its technology was integral to the space agency's operations. The lawsuits allege this was a calculated falsehood. In reality, the company had only received a few minor Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grants. These are common, low-value awards and do not represent a major strategic partnership. The plaintiffs argue that QCi improperly used the NASA brand to create a false impression of credibility and technological validation. In fact, you would be surprised how easy a company can get one of these contracts. The NASA Phase I grants QCi received were for approximately $125,000 to $150,000 each. It's the financial equivalent of a student receiving a $1,000 university grant to work on a science fair project, and then telling investors they have a major strategic partnership with the university to revolutionize the field.

The legal complaints further allege that the company created a false narrative of commercial readiness. While executives claimed to have market-ready products like the DIRAC-3 and a significant sales pipeline, the company's public financial filings reported negligible revenue. This data is presented as direct evidence that the commercial operations described to investors were a fiction. The lawsuits contend that the company was not a viable business but was merely pretending to be one to support its inflated market valuation.

Finally, the lawsuits claim that QCi made unsupported statements about its technological superiority, including achieving ""quantum advantage,"" without providing the necessary scientific proof. The plaintiffs argue that these were not good-faith claims but were technical jargon used to intentionally mislead investors who could not independently verify their accuracy. These legal actions now pose a direct threat to the company's operational stability, demanding millions in legal fees, consuming management's focus, and causing irreversible damage to its reputation.

**4) My personal note.** The field of quantum computing and its adjacent disciplines is still in its embryonic stage. It is a very active research field with a lot of math to discover, but hardware progress is extremely slow and there are no signs that it will speed up any time soon. 
Any prospect of a profitable, commercial quantum computing business remains decades away. A conservative estimate would place the timeline for consistent profitability at 20 years or more, and even then, it will only be achieved by the organization that makes fundamental breakthroughs in research. That level of discovery will not come from an underfunded startup with a negligible R&amp;D budget; it will almost certainly emerge from major research universities and/or Google and IBM. They possess scientific talent required to solve the hardest problems in science, QUBT does not.

Given this context, the valuations attached to companies like Quantum Computing Inc. are fundamentally absurd. They are not based in any recognizable financial or scientific reality. The claims made by the company's leadership are not merely optimistic; they are so far removed from the current state of the art that no credible expert in the field would support them. This disconnect is so severe that it transcends poor business strategy and enters the realm of potential securities fraud. When a company's public statements and valuation are in such stark opposition to the consensus of the scientific community, it raises serious questions that demand investigation by the appropriate financial authorities to determine if investors were willfully deceived.",0.04137043654918671,0.7865808606147766,0.17204873263835907,negative,0.7865808606147766,-0.7452104240655899
10,AAPL,Daily GOOGLE GOON SQUAD: $GOOGL$ is the true AI king and it’s about to print,"Fellow Regards and Degenerates,

I'm here to tell you that $GOOGL / $GOOG is the most criminally undervalued stock in mega-cap tech because it’s the undisputed leader in the technologies that define the next century. Forget the short-term noise. This is a deep dive into the strategic moat that others can't even dream of crossing.

**1. Future of Tech**

**Waymo**

Google's Waymo is WAY MORE than a competitor. It's the only fully scaled, commercialized Level 4 self-driving service available to the public. It operates 24/7 robotaxi services in multiple major US cities like Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin and testing in other cities

In San Francisco, its massive surge in volume has already resulted in its market share surpassing Lyft's, making it the city's second-most popular ride-hailing service. It’s the result of a decade-plus of calm, deep-pocketed investment, allowing it to log over 100 million fully autonomous miles and complete over 10 million paid trips. 

The sheer mileage, the complexity of the scaled deployments—which have demonstrated an 80% reduction in injury-causing crashes compared to human drivers—and the fact that they are now expanding internationally to places like Tokyo and London is a moat that no other company has even come close to building. The heck, there is no second competition in autonomous self-driving.

  
**Quantum Leap for Humanity**

The recent quantum discovery by Google, featuring its Quantum Echoes algorithm, is a major step toward making quantum computers a practical, powerful tool. This breakthrough, which demonstrated verifiable quantum advantage on the Willow quantum chip, is set to accelerate scientific discovery across key industries.

Specifically, the ability to perform verifiable quantum advantage means we can now trust a quantum computer to reliably solve real-world physics problems that are computationally infeasible for classical machines.

What Quantum Echoes Will Do

This breakthrough directly accelerates the original promise of quantum computing:

* Design Better Drugs and Cures: The Quantum Echoes algorithm ran 13,000 times faster on Willow than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This technique—which is already being used in a quantum-enhanced version of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) to study molecular structure—will dramatically cut the time it takes to discover and develop new, more effective medicines by providing unprecedented insights into how potential drug compounds interact with disease targets.
* Create Advanced New Materials: The algorithm's power to reveal previously undetectable details about atomic interactions will unlock the discovery and design of novel materials. This is vital for creating the next generation of:
   * High-Performance Batteries (for electric vehicles and energy storage).
   * More Efficient Solar Cells.
   * Lighter, Stronger Polymers for manufacturing and aerospace.

In short, Google's Quantum Echoes is an engineering milestone that moves quantum computing from a theoretical concept to a practical, verifiable machine for solving humanity's hardest scientific problems.

Think of it this way - The average age of a few generations from now will be approximately 100 years. This is truly remarkable.

  
**AI: The Medical Revolution**

AI, particularly from Google DeepMind, is already achieving breakthroughs that save time, money, and lives. This is AI's immediate, profitable impact.

* AlphaFold &amp; Isomorphic Labs: AlphaFold, an AI model from DeepMind, solved the 50-year-old problem of protein folding. This monumental achievement earned Google DeepMind's Demis Hassabis and John Jumper a share of the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry (along with David Baker). In simple terms, proteins are the body's tiny machines. Knowing their 3D shape is the blueprint for creating drugs. AlphaFold can find that blueprint in minutes, a process that used to take years. Isomorphic Labs is now using this and other advanced AI to design new small-molecule drugs from scratch at ""digital speed,"" accelerating drug discovery from years to months.
* AI and Quantum Synergy: This is where the magic happens. AI (the brain) helps guide the ultra-powerful quantum computer (the brawn) by identifying which molecules to focus on and then analyzing the quantum simulation results. This hybrid approach makes breakthroughs possible that would be computationally impossible otherwise. Google is the only company with a dominant lead in *both* technologies.

  
**2. AI Supremacy: The Foundational Architect**

The current AI boom exists because of Google, and its competitive position is strong due to decades of strategic investment focused on making powerful technology affordable enough to scale effectively. By now, it is widely known that the foundational technology for modern AI—the Transformer architecture—was created by Google.

* Models: Leading Across the Modalities Google has established market-leading or top-tier models across text, image, and video.
   * Text &amp; Multimodal: The Gemini family of models sets the pace in multimodal reasoning, handling text, code, audio, and video inputs.
   * Image (Nano Banana/Imagen): The technology powering Nano Banana (Gemini 2.5 Flash Image) excels at enterprise-critical tasks like advanced editing that preserves character/product consistency across iterations—a crucial capability for marketing and design.
   * Video (Veo): Google's cutting-edge video generation models, like Veo, are rapidly advancing the state-of-the-art in creating high-quality, long-form video content.
* Infrastructure: The TPU Efficiency Moat Google designs its own custom AI chips, the Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), which are engineered for peak AI efficiency and low-cost operation. They have spent years perfecting this hardware because a tech needs to be affordable for it to scale and work. This commitment to efficiency is so superior that competitors, including major AI labs, must increasingly rely on the latest generations of Google's custom hardware by coming to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to train and run their own cutting-edge models. This external validation proves that Google's approach is about making large-scale AI economically sensible.

The Vertical Advantage:

Google is the only major company that is competing fiercely and winning or coming close to the top in every critical layer of the AI stack:

1. Infrastructure (TPUs): Competing directly with NVIDIA on highly efficient, specialized AI silicon.
2. Foundation Models (Gemini, Imagen, Veo): Competing with OpenAI/Microsoft and Anthropic on core intelligence.
3. Applications (Nano Banana, AI Overviews): Integrating AI features into products that serve billions of users globally.

This end-to-end control, from the silicon chip to the final consumer application, provides a powerful strategic and economic advantage that is unmatched in the industry.

  
**3. The ChatGPT Myth and Search Dominance**

The idea that chatgpt will kill Google Search is a false narrative. Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Reddit all were supposed to reduce google search queries. They have only grown. This new technology has made it much easier to ask any type or questions in any language. We were previously limited to what we would or could google. Now there are no limits. The more we know, the more questions we have and the more we search. Google search will be just fine.

I think ChatGPT will become another app on the phone where users will go to. I envision it as a personal assistant and less of search. But only time will tell.

Google was and will remain the gateway to the internet. The new AI business will be a net positive for Google by creating a new revenue stream through Google Cloud (GCP) and gemini features and subscriptions to its user base.

**4. The Financial Powerhouse and PE Hypothesis**

The fundamentals confirm this giant is firing on all cylinders.

* Net Income King: Alphabet's Trailing Twelve Months net income ending June 30, 2025, was $115.573 Billion, making it one of the most profitable companies in the world. This was more than MSFT $101.832 billion and APPL $99.280 billion
* Accelerating Triple-Threat Growth: All core segments - Google Cloud, Youtube and Google Search  are growing at double-digit rates.

The core reason Google's Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio is generally lower than many other tech companies is its revenue mix being heavily dominated by consumer advertising.

  
Simply put, investors are willing to pay a higher multiple (PE) for the more predictable, higher-margin, and rapidly growing recurring revenue streams typical of enterprise software and cloud platforms.

My hypothesis is with AI increasingly driving revenue through Google Cloud Platform (GCP), the enterprise segment will become a bigger component of Google's business mix, and hence, the company will earn a higher blended Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio. This is because Enterprise and Cloud businesses are valued more highly, providing predictable, high-margin, recurring subscription revenue (SaaS), a financial profile superior to advertising. As this higher-multiple segment captures a greater share of Google's overall profit, the market will be forced to re-rate $GOOGL with a higher blended multiple, making the current valuation—which is depressed by the ad-centric multiple look like a significant undervaluation and a compelling investment opportunity.

  
TLDR : GOOGL is a generational buy. You're buying the best-in-class *present* (Search/Maps/YouTube), the scaled *near-future* (Waymo/GCP), and the *long-term future* (Quantum/AI Core Tech) at a discount.

12,AAPL,$GRAB 15k YOLO and DD,"DD:

For too long $GRAB has been priced as a “just another” rideshare company. It’s not. 

Grab is a growing ecosystem of mobility, food and parcel delivery, advertising, and financial services. The company is creating a cohesive set of services that draw users in through one or two products they provide, and then those consumers adapt to using the entire system. It reminds me of Apple— a system that consumers adapt to using all the services within it. When you have an IPhone, you are likely to also use Apple Pay, AirPods, Apple Music, and Apple TV. The key of all this is cohesiveness and convenience. Why use multiple different services when you can use those services within one application, where they are all specially tailored to work well together? That’s the beauty of $GRAB. It’s not going to be the next Apple, but it could be the Apple of super apps. 


Its founder-led, has 7B in cash, 2B in debt at a 26B valuation. Their FCF is up 40% this year and they are set to rocket into profitability this year. I expect earnings to be very strong this quarter, between $0.03 and $0.045 EPS. The coming months are looking very bullish for Grab, especially after this recent pullback from highs.  


Here’s the next key part of the GRAB thesis:

Grab’s user base only makes up about 6% of the total SEA population. That’s projected to grow by about 20-40%, but not double or triple in the next few years. I believe that projection is wrong. Part of Grab’s strategic goal is to tap into the rising prosperity of the population of SEA. But the kicker is that they aren’t just taking advantage of this but actually effectuating rising prosperity in Southeast Asia:
Grab’s Financial services arm states they have a mission of serving a large under-banked/un-banked population in SEA through its wallet, payments, embedded finance. Grab offers a banking service and lines of credit to its drivers, who are raised out of poverty by the services Grab provides. 

But how does the emerging market of SEA relate to the price? I believe the growth of SEA is going to be higher than the projected growth of the company, meaning that revenue will exceed expectations:

Rising prosperity and smartphone growth both directly expand Grab’s reach and profitability, obviously. As more Southeast Asians gain smartphones, Grab’s addressable market widens and new users can access rides, deliveries, and digital payments all within the app. Higher disposable income shifts consumers from necessity to convenience: more frequent rides, premium services, and food delivery. With greater digital adoption, people move from cash to GrabPay, strengthening Grab’s financial arm and embedding users deeper in its ecosystem. Each new user increases cross-use of Grab’s services, boosting engagement, data insights, and margins.
Meanwhile, merchants and drivers benefit from these same trends, as rising prosperity lets small businesses and gig workers join Grab’s logistics and finance networks, expanding the company’s footprint into new cities and rural markets.

So why will growth of SEA outstrip GRAB’s growth projections? Because GRAB actually helps EFFECTUATE the rise in banking, prosperity, and upward mobility. Grab accelerates prosperity in Southeast Asia by connecting people, businesses, and finance through its super-app:

It provides steady income to drivers and merchants who once worked informally, digitizing their earnings and making them credit-eligible.

Its GrabPay wallet and financial services help millions of unbanked citizens save, borrow, and insure themselves for the first time. By linking small merchants to online customers, Grab expands local business and creates a huge amount of potential for upward mobility. 

One final thing to address: Many ask, if Grab is so undervalued, why haven’t Institutions stepped in to buy? Why do you think the most successful financial institutions are wrong about $GRAB? 

Here’s the kicker: $GRAB has over 80% INSTITUTIONAL OWNERSHIP. It’s not the institutions who are wrong, it’s RETAIL. While retail is focused elsewhere, the elites of the financial world are scooping up millions of shares. So I’m buying GRAB before it’s too late. This isn’t financial advice, just my own opinion on the stock and I’ve decided to put my money where my mouth is. I plan to add more and more GRAB shares with every paycheck as well. 


POSITIONS:
GRAB 7C for 12/27: this is the main position, I’m planning to exercise these in a few years. I project GRAB will be above 12 by 2028. Value ~$9,000

GRAB 6-7C 11/14: I’m extremely bullish for earnings, and I think the stock could break past the 6.50s again shortly after. This is a high risk play which I wouldn’t recommend to most. 

GRAB 6.5-7.5 11/14: Just a $400 lotto ticket for fun

GRAB 10-12C 1/21/28: I believe this is the best R/R play for options on GRAB. I plan to buy hundreds more as I build an aggressive position on the stock. At .20 average cost, these have the potential to return almost 900% at expiration. 

Thanks for reading everyone!

Here’s the kicker: $GRAB has over 80% INSTITUTIONAL OWNERSHIP. It’s not the institutions who are wrong, it’s RETAIL. While retail is focused elsewhere, the elites of the financial world are scooping up millions of shares. So I’m buying GRAB before it’s too late. This isn’t financial advice, just my own opinion on the stock and I’ve decided to put my money where my mouth is. I plan to add more and more GRAB shares with every paycheck as well. 


POSITIONS:
GRAB 7C for 12/27: this is the main position, I’m planning to exercise these in a few years. I project GRAB will be above 12 by 2028. Value ~$9,000

GRAB 6-7C 11/14: I’m extremely bullish for earnings, and I think the stock could break past the 6.50s again shortly after. This is a high risk play which I wouldn’t recommend to most. 

GRAB 6.5-7.5 11/14: Just a $400 lotto ticket for fun

GRAB 10-12C 1/21/28: I believe this is the best R/R play for options on GRAB. I plan to buy hundreds more as I build an aggressive position on the stock. At .20 average cost, these have the potential to return almost 900% at expiration.

# INTC IS A SLEEPING DRAGON

**TLDR; No tldr, you have to read it and make an educated decision**

# Intro

I've been researching INTC ever since China started taking more interest in supporting the war in Ukraine. With the orange man talking about how he will not aid NATO in EU it got me thinking. Why would he say that? Could they be gearing up for a multi-front war and wouldn't be able to stretch their forces?

I put on my tin foil hat and started digging in. Taiwan is obviously a very important geopolitical player due to their advanced microchip manufacturing. Recall what chaos happened when COVID struck and TSMC fell behind,.. It took several years to recover. So here I am thinking, who is the only microchip manufacturer that can produce a microchip from nothing.

INTC

# 8-10 Months ago - First play, didn't post DD but regret

Before Trumps election I was looking into their fundamentals and I came to a simple conclusion:

* They were **undervalued at &lt; $20**, because book value was approx. $22.5 at the time

I hesitated but eventually bought in when it went up to $20.12. Buying 800 shares. The idea behind the play was simple, INTC is a critical US asset:

* They are a DoD contractor, all the chips in any weapons, computers, gps ... chances are it's Intel.
* They are the only manufacturer that can produce chips from the ground up
* New CEO with a very good track record of turning around dying companies

**Problems INTC faced:**

* A lot of investments into startups, they tried to be like Microsoft but failed miserably
* Very bad middle management and disproportionately big for the company (I even have some insider info from this)
* Innovation was stalling (well except for a few things)

**Advantages of INTC:**

* Servers are still predominantely INTC, although they were losing ground
* TEE dominance, if you need a trusted execution environment - you will use INTCs SGX (and now they're newer one)
* FHE investments - for those who don't know Fully Homomorphic Encryption is the ""holy grail of encryption"", most of FHE schemes are also QUANTUM resistant

# CEO fixed most problems

CEO started doing all the right plays

* Fired a lot of the middle management and made the company lean
* Sold other investments that they had which was good even if it was a loss to generate money
* Started focusing INTC to be engineer-first again

I expected a $60 PT within 3 years on INTC as a very pessimistic/conservative estimate.

# Trump invests, SoftBank invests, NVIDIA

I expected Trump and I did expect some bank funding, what I didn't expect was NVIDIA but it makes sense.

AMD was gaining ground with their GPUs and although NVDA is much better when it comes to:

* Infra, i.e. networking for HPCs
* Software, i.e. cuda
* Results

NVDA knew that it's just a matter of time when AMD catches ground. So how do you fix this issue? You advance your technology or you make sure that you have preferential treatment at the available foundries.

# The new DD, Mystery client unveiling

I was extremely mad, when on one day I forgot to buy my 1 year leaps for $40 CALLS on INTC, because the next day I see that NVDA invests and suddenly the premiums were 3x. But I still bought, and now I'm buying more. This time I plan on writing my DD to explain why.

I've kept on researching and trying to assess if they will gain more ground. Why would NVDA invest? What technology does INTC have that AMD/TSMC does not?

Well as I've investigated I found several exciting pieces of information:

1. The CEO of INTC has invested and is on the board of a Swiss startup that not so long ago demonstrated a new microchip cooling technology this new micro-fluid cooling technology is supplementary to traditional cooling. And here's the kicker... MSFT has interest in this startup as well [https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/innovation/microfluidics-liquid-cooling-ai-chips/](https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/innovation/microfluidics-liquid-cooling-ai-chips/). So why is this impressive? Well for starters it's 3x more effective than traditional cooling (and that's just the start). A lot of datacenters have to waste money not only to power the GPUs themselves, but to also power the cooling. But it has another kicker and I will get to that in the next chapter as it has even BIGGER implications.
2. INTC has technology that sets it apart from TSMC and gives them a year-two head start. This technology is called ""backside power delivery"". To put it briefly, you power it from the back of the wafer instead of the front, where it needs to go through multiple layers of metal -&gt; each layer adds resistance -&gt; voltage drops, heat goes up -&gt; wasted power, more cooling needed -&gt; more wasted power. So again, less power? Less cooling? Two different technologies?
3. Now there are rumors about a potential big client for new AI datacenters and it's rumored that it's MSFT. Well I'm pretty certain it is MSFT -&gt; see the first point. A big client that will manufacture in INTC foundries will mean the foundry will start printing money. Let me clarify for you, NVDA invested and shared tech, but didn't manufacture YET.
4. Why would NVDA share GPU tech with INTC? Well because they figured out that INTC 18A is happening and it's gonna be a bomb with the lower power input needed. Specifically for laptops. Now you're gonna have laptops with Intel and NVDA cramming up the market. People will develop more (think of it as a vendor-lock) for NVDA (CUDA) and the demand for NVDA datacenters will grow. Because it will grow, and TSMC is already filled to the brim with orders, you need to get manufacturing done somewhere else, so why not with INTC CPUs - The tech was already tested for several years anyway and more importantly. It will create a bigger foothold for NVDA GPU datacenters. Remember you have to wait like a year or two before you get a H100.

This means that the NVDA investment was a long term strategic investment.

# Ok so what's the big deal about cooling - why it's so important?

Well one of the main reasons and I'm gonna keep it short here is that if you want to shrink transistors, you need to be able to cool them. The smaller you go, the more they start failing in high heat and the more you have of them the more it heats up. The road to &lt;2nm tech is through improved cooling especially due to things like quantum tunneling. The moment you go to 1nm quantum tunneling is a thing and transistors start leaking energy because electrons behave like waves -&gt; power loss and heat. With advanced cooling you can overcome this.

Here comes a little bit of quantum hype... Have you heard about the Majorana-1 chip? Yes, developed by microsoft. INTC is more than ever setting itself up to become the main goto manufacturer of quantum microchips.

# Foundries are fully operational

Arizona’s Fab 52 is fully operational and set to reach high-volume production using Intel 18A later this year, strengthening U.S. technology and manufacturing leadership. They are already producing 18A chips that they debuted not so long ago and are already being shipped to clients.

# A hidden shark

There was one big client of INTC that was very unhappy with the fact that the chips were overheating, AAPL. There are rumors they are looking into INTC and see how they perform. Additional rumors indicate that they might test them out with ""less flashy"" orders like apple remotes etc.

# Possible manufacturing bottleneck

There is a possibility that INTC will become the new manufacturing bottleneck - such an event would explode INTC's price up.

# PT

These are my estimates and will cause me to reconsider my long term strategy depending on how it goes:

Overly Optimistic: $80+ within a 1 year  
Optimistic: $100+ within 2-3 years.  
Realistic/Pessimistic: $80 in 2 years.

# So why invest now?

Company is back on track, has secured a lot of funding/investments, has strong govermental support and rising tensions with China play into INTCs cards. The company is completely restructured and set to be innovative, they have a strong base and good book value to be ""start-up like"" but with actual ground to stand on.

# Catalysts and what to look out for

Possibly positive catalysts:

* Earning Calls are expected to be very positive. Might also include the reveal of the client, but doubt it. Depending on what they share the price might skyrocket
* Jan26, we will have news about the Arizona FAB 52 and how well it's performing
* Q4 2025, Q2, Q3 2026 earning calls -&gt; These will have the most impact in the upcoming year with Q4 being the biggest.
* Higher tensions in Russian-Ukranian war. China has funded Russia and in return requested paratrooper training. The longer the RU/UA war goes the higher the chance China will decide to go for Taiwan.
* Autumn / April of each year going onwards. This is the window if I'm not mistaken when there aren't high seas in the taiwan strait, making it possible to perform an amphibious landing.

Negative catalysts:

* Jan26, failing production
* Q2-Q3, failing interest in 18A - undelivered promises, overheats etc.
* TSMC moves advance tech on US soil (unlikely, will incentives US to abandon Taiwan)

# What am I doing?

Increasing my position with leaps **before and after earning calls**. As the current earning calls can have the opposite effect given what's been happening lately.

P.S. Sorry for grammar mistakes, I didn't use chatgpt or any other autocorrect to write this.

**DISCLAIMER: This is not financial advice, invest only at your own risk and after doing some additional research into the company. Keep in mind that INTC was very violent and jumpy the last few years. My position is bullish, but market downturn or recession can happen at any moment.**

**EDIT 28.10. pre-market:** I have a reasonable suspicion to believe that AMD might also be the AI client. If that's the case it won't be because of the actual main chip manufacturing but possibly microcontrollers etc.  
I consider this more of a tinfoil conspiracy, given the latest news regarding AMD AI Datacenter, financed by DoE. However if it is truly MSFT then this is even bigger because of their stake in OpenAI [https://x.com/unusual\_whales/status/1983161407802941901?s=46](https://x.com/unusual_whales/status/1983161407802941901?s=46)",46,99,1761239525.0,2025-10-23T17:12:05+00:00,t3_1oe92la,"INTC Is A Sleeping Dragon https://preview.redd.it/cneb9e699wwf1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98cf08539a407513c6ba31936b34601c2b164024

As a redditor of 16 years, I decided to cash in my years of redditing by full porting not only my account but my parents' as well into RDDT after having completely missed the 2024 rally.

I tell him, no, we buy more, and so we did.

Despite all the price target raises to $300, PT reiterates at $300, talks of negotiating a new AI deal with Google, high likelihood of settling with Anthropic in mediation, massive earnings beat, and guidance raise far beyond what the Street was expecting, RDDT continued to sell off far beyond a normal range when the rest of the market was continuing to rip to new ATHs day after day. The reduced ChatGPT citation news then came out of nowhere and dropped RDDT another 15% despite having already corrected 15% from the peak. And over the past few days, RDDT continued on the struggle bus with the market ripping.

Something felt off. And so, I decided to add some *wrinkles* to my smoothe brain.



# 🧠 What My Smoothe Brain Thought Was the 🌈 Bear Case

* **“RDDT was overbought.”** *Sure, the stock had run up a lot (relative strength was high). A cooldown was expected. This might explain a* ***normal*** *correction, but not a 30% crash on high volume. Even the 0 revenue quantum stocks hasn't corrected this much in this rate cutting cycle environment.*
* **Decrease in DAU** on sites like Semrush:
   * *Google eliminated the num=100 parameter which broke search result tracking sites and resulted in web traffic drops across all sites.* [Citizens](https://markets.financialcontent.com/stocks/article/marketminute-2025-10-3-reddit-rebounds-analysts-dismiss-ai-fears-as-data-licensing-and-ad-growth-drive-optimism) *even pointed this out in their report, but still no sustainable bounce.*
* **ChatGPT reduction in citations**:
   * [Sam Altman directly/indirectly owns 8.7% of RDDT](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/29/sam-altmans-reddit-stake-now-worth-over-1-billion-after-earnings-pop.html)*, so a complete reversal of his opinion on reddit seemed unlikely to me, unlike what several headlines and analysts suggested.*
   * *ChatGPT citations alone don't bring that much traffic to reddit and only account for 5% of RDDT's revenue, so another 15% drop seemed too much especially in the context of a* [new deal being negotiated with Google](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/reddit-stock-ai-deal-google-openai/)*.

   * *We all learned in high school not to cite Wikipedia, but we still use it because it's useful. Imagine our teachers' faces when reddit comments were being cited by ChatGPT as primary sources. Just because reddit isn't cited, doesn't mean it's not being used at all.*

This entire selloff just seemed too much for RDDT to drop after such stellar earnings and even stronger guidance in this environment where the [MEME ETF ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meme-stock-resurgence-prompts-return-184355645.html)returned from the grave and ARKK is up 61% YTD. It just didn't make sense.

This was when my smoothe brain formed its first wrinkle. I then remembered there was a non-sense hearing scheduled for 10:00am on Oct. 8 which I ignored the first time around. It sounded like it'd be a meme hearing when I imagined u/spez, Gaben, Discord, and Twitch testifying in front of Congress. I also figured out it wasn't going to happen due to the government shutdown as this was the most non-essential government hearing that I've ever heard of.

Despite all this, RDDT continued to dump 5% and on Oct. 8 right at 10:00am on the day of the originally scheduled hearing when it was clear the hearing was postponed, RDDT bounced. I thought to myself, did we actually bounce because the hearing was canceled. **Then it clicked. My second wrinkle** popped into existence. I downed my Red Bulls and put together this timeline.

# 🤯From Smoothe Brain to Wrinkley Brain

After putting together this timeline and matching it up against the way RDDT has been moving over the past 3 weeks, everything made so much more sense. There were enough examples of global radicalism linked to social media, to the point it spooked bulls.

The smart money took profits and the **🌈** Bears shorted RDDT bigly, betting that u/spez would be crucified at the hearing. At the hearing, **Spez would be in a lose/lose situation** where his only option would be to confirm that reddit does not allow doxxing, bans users who threaten violence, etc. and **agree to do whatever the Congressional circus** demands him to do, otherwise, **they would threaten to remove reddit's** [**Section 230 immunity**](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R46751) which would **result in reddit being liable** as a publisher for what redditors post. **A death sentence ☠️ for reddit and all social media companies**.

This would of course be perceived by redditors as a capitulating on free speech, and I'm sure many redditors would threaten to leave. Spez also can't pull a Zuck and donate to Trump as this would piss off most redditors even more.

The concession I speculate Spez made was by proactively sunsetting of public chats. While I find this feature is helpful at times for subreddits like r/redditstock, I don't use it much personally but I know other redditors love it. What I can see happening is bad actors using it for nefarious purposes. It wouldn't surprise me if there may have been a few ""Antifun"" individuals who abused this community function which resulted in getting this feature disabled for everyone.

In the context of these outbreaks of violence with social media being used by bad actors, I speculate that Sam Altman, an 8.7% shareholder of RDDT and former reddit CEO of 4 days, may have expedited an update to reduce reddit citations given that only a month prior, reddit was frequently cited making up 41% of LLM citations. Or this was pure coincidence but the timing just seemed a bit sus. Either way, Altman wouldn't want to risk being on Trump's shitlist and risk Trump accusing ChatGPT of being woke due to a high citation percentage of reddit. That would risk development of Star Gate.

What I completely disagree with is commentary from some analysts who argued that reddit data and OpenAI's relationship with reddit is any less valuable after this change. Reddit is incredibly valuable for sentiment analysis and for verifying if a product with thousands of 5 star reviews is actually legitimate. Like random ass Chinese bluetooth headphones from Xyrbx with a 4.95 rating and over 3,000 reviews. Reddit sentiment analysis would easily flag that as being fake af.



# 🔬Testing My Theory

If my interpretation of the timeline holds true, I thought that one way to test this is to see how META moved during this time, even though they weren't invited for the hearing. And look, META and RDDT's movement look quite similar. The major risk to all social media companies is if Trump were to threaten the removal of Section 230 immunity . But with the ""Antifun"" terrorist designation, well, that causes an even bigger problem for all social media companies.

AMZN (Twitch/Hassan Piker) and NFLX (streaming service of Money Heist which popularized the song Bella Ciao which was declared to be the anthem of ""Antifun"") also moved similarly to RDDT and META since September. All 4 stocks started to recover yesterday as I believe ""Antifun"" short covering started.

And if there was a lot of fear with civil uprisings, I thought, why not look into opening up a trade in guns and gold if you have govenment topplings happen. Gun stocks are up 30% from September, and GLD is at the moon. So yes, there was a clear systematic trade that bet on all this and those trades are reversing.



# 💎💰🚀The Trade Thesis

The **🌈** Bears positioned for an Oct 8 hearing without realizing that the hearing was postponed due to the government shutdown. After seeing that the ""Antifun"" roundtable didn't trigger a full on collapse below yesterday's support, this signaled that the ""Antifun"" trade bottomed out and the covering started. Options flow yesterday showed a lot of puts being sold and the return of 🐂🐳Bull whales with **$7.5M** in **210 and 220 strike June 2027 calls** which sparked a lot more call buying and confirmation of the bull flag breakout.

There are still a lot more **🌈** Bears who haven't made this ""Antifun"" short connection and still think all of this is related to RDDT being a meme, is no longer useful to AI, and will miss on earnings. They're about to get blown out as **Polymarket puts the shutdown ending after 10/15 at 85% odds**. RDDT earnings is on Oct 30, so there is only a limited window for the hearing to be scheduled before earnings. I actually see **RDDT as a hedge for a prolonged shutdown** as this just delays the upcoming hearing.

With \~16-18% short interest, RDDT's tiny float, and an earnings blackout period coming up, the time is now to give the **🌈** Bears a new gap. With an expected earnings blow out and the hearing having already been priced in, I think we'll break to new ATHs post earnings. I do expect a moderate pullback once the hearing is officially rescheduled but view the hearing as a buy the news event.

After a new ATH and 2 back-to-back rate cuts, this would make RDDT a top contender for S&amp;P 500 inclusion in the December S&amp;P 500 balancing. RDDT was skipped in September despite the 4 consecutive quarters of profit. Just look at how APP and HOOD ripped after the inclusion. Except this would be during the Santa Claus rally and complete index rebalancing in the last trading day of December. 🚀🚀🚀

# 😶‍🌫️Conclusion - Make Money Doing What You Love

There isn't a more wrinkle-brain move than to make millions from my 16 years of redditing. If you've reached the end of this post, ask yourself. What compelled you to read through to the end? Maybe, just maybe, you can add some wrinkles to your brain and make money doing what you love. [BECAUSE I FUCKING LOVE REDDIT. I'M NEVER GETTING OFF OF REDDIT.](https://youtube.com/shorts/E3hy6HGm2wo?si=xNc5_z8Kh2ZOJRec)",861,281,1760099015.0,2025-10-10T12:23:35+00:00,t3_1o2zf8d,"[DD] RDDT $2.3M Full Family Port Yolo - BTFD, Betting The Family Dynasty **TL;DR:** This selloff wasn't based on reduced ChatGPT citations. It was linked to political news (**Charlie Kirk** **RIP** → **Revenge of the 🌈 Bears** → **""Antifun""** (I don't want to end up on the FBI watchlist) **Terrorist Executive Order** → **Congressional hearing postponed** → **🌈 Bears cover before earnings** → **2x Fed rate cuts** → **December S&amp;P 500 inclusion** → **Dynasty**).

As a redditor of 16 years, I decided to cash in my years of redditing by full porting not only my account but my parents' as well into RDDT after having completely missed the 2024 rally. From the peak at $282, I expected a ""moderate"" pullback of 15% but was kicked in the balls with a 30% drawdown, wiping out $1mil in profits. Dad calls me asking me, should we should sell? I tell him, no, we buy more, and so we did.

Despite all the price target raises to $300, PT reiterates at $300, talks of negotiating a new AI deal with Google, high likelihood of settling with Anthropic in mediation, massive earnings beat, and guidance raise far beyond what the Street was expecting, RDDT continued to sell off far beyond a normal range when the rest of the market was continuing to rip to new ATHs day after day. The reduced ChatGPT citation news then came out of nowhere and dropped RDDT another 15% despite having already corrected 15% from the peak. And over the past few days, RDDT continued on the struggle bus with the market ripping.

Something felt off. And so, I decided to add some *wrinkles* to my smoothe brain.

21,AAPL,Apple tables Vision Pro sequel to pursue smart glasses: report,"Apple has tabled its efforts to produce a follow-up to its Vision Pro headset in favor of developing a new line of smart glasses powered by artificial intelligence, according to Bloomberg.

The Cupertino company has moved staff from working on its new, lighter and cheaper Vision Pro to focus on its smart glasses, which would be similar to those offered by Meta Platforms, the report said, citing people close to the issue. Apple engineers are working on at least two types of the smart glasses. One is being crafted to be paired with an iPhone and will lack its own display. This could be revealed as soon as 2026. The other version will contain a display similar to the recently released Meta Ray-Ban Display.

Apple's smart glasses are expected to utilize voice interaction and AI capabilities, the report said. It would also rely on an upgraded Siri, which is projected for a March release at the earliest. They would also feature a much lower price tag than the Vision Pro, which started at $3,499.

22,AAPL,$SNAP – The Only Specs That Matter 🚀,"Alright, listen up smoothbrains. While you apes are busy lighting your grandma’s retirement funds on fire buying quantum vaporware stocks with zero revenue and YOLO’ing into Opendoor like it’s the next Amazon instead of a failing real estate pawn shop, I’m looking at a stock that could 10x if this plays out. Yes, the ghost app you use to send nudes to your ex is actually a once-in-a-decade moon ticket.

[“JPow told my wife this was safe”](https://preview.redd.it/a84d6o9qglsf1.png?width=934&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=374dc3ecc175dde106a5375911dff2da3083c33b)

Now let me explain why your mom’s boyfriend is bullish:

1. **ATH Collapse** – SNAP’s all-time high was \~$80 before Tim Apple slapped them across the face with iOS privacy changes. Ads went limp, Wall Street bailed, and SNAP cratered harder than your mom’s Tinder date. But that’s the reason the stock is sitting at 5-year lows today: **the decline was external, not because the company is fundamentally trash**.
2. **Spectacles = The Real AR Play** – SNAP has been grinding on AR spectacles for a decade. While Zuckbot embarrassed himself with his laugh-track VR demo, SNAP dropped a prototype that actually looks **usable**. Their consumer “Specs” are dropping in 2026, lighter and cheaper than the dev versions. They even built **Snap OS**, a full-blown platform optimized for AR, but you wouldn’t know that because you were too busy watching anime lolis instead of reading investor decks and paying attention to product demos.
3. **8 Billion Daily AR Lenses vs Google’s 14 Billion Searches** – On mobile alone, SNAP’s AR lenses are used **8 billion times a day**. Let me say that again: **8 BILLION WITH a ""B""**. Google search does \~14 billion daily. That means people are snapping AR dogs and anime filters like crazy at HALF THE SCALE OF GOOGLE SEARCH. When Specs launch, SNAP controls **both the hardware and the software**. That means unrestricted ad targeting, a user experience way better than the janky mobile AR crap, and here’s the kicker: they demoed **collaborative AR** between Specs users and mobile users. Imagine shoving ads in both realities at once. That’s a money printer even Papa Powell would respect.

I’m early into this play. Specs aren’t out until 2026, but the market is asleep at the wheel. SNAP’s been buying back stock in 2025, cutting costs with layoffs (10% in 2025), and getting their comp structure under control. They’re quietly setting the stage for the next wave while you guys YOLO weekly SPY puts like brain-damaged chimps.

Now, I’ll keep it real with you:

* Competition exists. But except for Meta, **Google and Apple don’t have social platforms** to tie AR into. Meta is bleeding billions on legless VR Sims. Apple’s Vision Pro flop shows that having the social layer is critical.
* Stock comp was a headwind, but layoffs and buybacks are stabilizing things.
* User growth is slowing but that’s true for all social media platforms. SNAP has 900 million monthly active users. The key is jumping onto the next big thing that feeds into revenue.
* CEO Evan Spiegel has majority voting rights. Which means if he wakes up one day and decides to turn the ghost into a furry NFT, we’re screwed. Expect some WSB level decisions at times.

**Bottom line:** SNAP is sitting near its 5-year low, the market has priced in zero upside, and the next catalyst (Specs) is massive. From here, this can only go up. Not financial advice. I am jacked to the tits.

33,AAPL,Duolingo DD," Dear, Ladies, gentleman and degenerate market regards

I’ve been doing a deep dive into one particular public company called Duolingo. You might be saying “wtf the language learning app?”. Yes correct, that app with the green owl. A company can be selling dog food for all I care, but if the numbers and the narrative are good, I'm buying. That being said, Duolingo ($DUOL) is slowly presenting an amazing opportunity as the stock price continues to fall. Opportunities like this is how life changing wealth is made. When everyone is betting on the downfall, you take the other side of that trade and bet against them all. The risk to reward ratio on this is too good to ignore.

Would also like to mention, if you’re an ape who has been buying into the hype of palantir with a disgusting 600 PE ratio, so high that you might as well buy your local pizza shop thats makes 100k a year for 50 million, then duolingo should not be a problem for you to take a chance on.

**The Narrative**

The bubble has officially popped on Duolingo due to rising fears of competitors entering the market. The two main competitors as of right now are OPENAI, and the tech giant GOOGLE. People are discovering through OpenAi that you can create your own language learning game and are rumoring that people will no longer need duolingo. Google had also announced that they will be entering the language learning app space with google translator utilizing ai for live language conversion. Duolingo did also damage their PR by announcing they would be utilizing AI as well, which the public did not take lightly as they misunderstood it for replacing their employees with AI. Users also had reason to believe that AI will create poor quality content in comparison to having humans manually make the courses which may be true; however, if other companies are in the race utilizing AI for language learning, then Duolingo must compete. Those 3 narratives were enough to pop the bubble of duolingo as it has fallen from $542 to $282 as of today. Can the stock fall further? Yes it can, but it's one of those scenarios where you want it to.

The P/E ratio of Duolingo was over 300 at its peak on May 15th 2025. Yes the company was way overvalued at the time for a growth company, (a fair valuation for growth companies range between (40-80) however the company is consistently beating earnings expectations and their free cash flow continues to rise higher and higher. Today that P/E ratio has dropped to 122 and its price to sales ratio has dropped to 15:1. Yes those numbers still do seem high, but 

as their free cash flow continues to rise, that P/E ratio will drop into fair valuations. Understand that this company is growing on average 40% year over year. For those who don't understand, markets are always forward looking. The institutions and retail investors who are buying into this company are betting on the fact that the over valuation numbers will drop as they consistently report good earnings, revenue and forward guidance.

**The Bull Thesis**

So before being able to predict the future, you first need to look into the past where history doesn't always repeat itself, but it sure does rhyme. Take a look at the success of Netflix. Even when Amazon, Apple, Disney and Google (youtube) entered the space of video streaming, people thought Netflix would be in serious trouble. In 2011, Amazon announced that they would offer Amazon prime video for free with their subscription; while at the same time Netflix decided to increase their prices by 60%. 

Customers were furious and Netflix lost over 800 000 subscribers in 1 quarter. This resulted in their Free cash flow dropping from 59 million in quarter 2 of 2011, to 15 million in quarter 3 of 2011. Eventually their free cash flow did fall into the negatives and recovered in 2013 (you can see how the stock follows that on the charts).

**The Moat**

There is no moat. Just branding. “How is this bullish?” Well lets think, what’s Spotify's moat? What about Netflix? Literally just branding is the moat, so people who think duolingo’s demise is due to a lack of a business moat are delusional. It’s like saying in the year 2000, “why would anyone buy into amazon when anyone can make a website and sell books?” fucking regards. 

**User Experience**

When you look at music streaming services, spotify ($SPOT) was the first to the game publicly. Eventually, Apple, Google (youtube), Amazon and about 20 other music streaming platforms nobody gives a fuck about had entered the game. Yet to this day, spotify is what’s most popular among them all taking 36% of the music streaming market. Why? User experience is the answer. The spotify platform itself is what carries them and separates them from the rest for both artists and customers. 

**The Brand**

The infamous green owl logo is famous across the world. Duolingo is a world wide icon for language learning. When people hear that “ding\* sound completing a duolingo game, everyone knows instantly that it's duolingo. When people ask about learning another language, they instantly point people in the direction of duolingo. It's literally the rank #13 app on the app store for apple and on the front page of “essential apps.”

	When people talk to each other about music they ask “what's you’re spotify?” Nobody asks whats your “apple music, amazon music or youtube music”

	When your wife’s boyfriend is asking her to come over and watch a movie, he says “netflix and chill” NOT “amazon prime, disney, or apple tv and chill?” the fuck?

I'm listing these examples, because they all have a subscription business model just like duolingo. That being said, duolingo’s subscription model is actually better than theirs.

**Business Model**

Ad revenue and subscriptions, that's it. People pay a yearly subscription for their ability to learn new languages which has been proven to be more effective and enjoyable than any other method through gamification. You got kids who are using this damn app in school, recommended by their teachers and you have parents buying it for their kids. Lets not forget that this company is now going to expand out of just language learning as they have included learning subjects like music, math and chess. 

Wait? Chess? Wtf? 

Yes that's exactly what I'm thinking, but if you look beyond that, Duolingo is expanding to hit the whole education market. Why pay for chess lessons from elsewhere when you can get it on duolingo with 100+ additional learning courses. Ideally, duolingo is expanding into a whole education platform, more directed towards the youth for everything. I wouldn't be surprised if they included courses like science, finance, health etc…

	They have utilized AI in addition to help the teachers/course makers create new courses at a very accelerated pace. Their first 100 courses took them 12 years. Now with AI, they are generating 153 new courses in 1 year.

	There is NO FRICTION.

* No governments/regulations trying to stop this
* No maintenance on their assets (courses)
* No real competition in user experience

All they have to do is create a great product (a course), add it into their catalog of other courses that comes with the subscription. The more they add, the more incentive there is to go with duolingo instead of buying learning programs elsewhere.

**The Bear Thesis**

Go fuck yourself?

On a serious note, looking at Google live translation app which they offer for free; it does seem to be very reliable, but strictly for translating. They claim to be offering language learning practice tools on their google translate app which would be free. Not to mention, there are already over 1 billion downloads of google translate. Comparing it to Duolingo, yes both of them are free, however; google has not announced whether they would  put a pay wall behind learning/using their practice tool. However what google is missing in comparison to Duolingo secret formula of success would be gamification. 

If the companies continues to show slower growth, or continues to show a decline in active user for the few quarters; well then, we’re fucked. But as of right now, the decline in free cash flow from last quarter to this isn’t ""catastrophic,"" but rather a typical overreaction to the narrative. 

**External Risks**

Rising interest rates. Lets be real, trump is calling for lower interest rates but obviously Jerome Powell doesn't want to follow through with it. In the long term event that they can’t afford to lower rates but rather might  increase rates; the broad market does face the risk of a downturn just like in 2022-2023, which of course would most likely add more downward pressure to the stock and market as a whole.

Another external risk that may present itself is a massive bull market in gold, and extreme volatility in government bond markets, more specifically the 10 year yield bonds. For those who don't understand, a massive bull market in gold has always signaled warning signs that something is about to break in the financial system, because gold has always been considered the safe haven asset. Extreme volatility in bond markets signal panic when the yields spread too far apart from the benchmark rate of the federal reserve, which stands at 4.25 as of right now.

Free cash flow = cash from operations - capital expenditures.

Notice how their free cash flow keeps on rising? Notice how free cash flow has dropped in Q2 compared to Q1 of 2025? That small decline in free cash flow, paired with the narrative of the company's demise in the future has resulted in a crash from $542 to $282. Let me tell you right now, if this company reports an increase in free cash flow in the next few earnings calls; Not only can the narrative change from negative to positive, this stock can very well turn around and go bullish very fast.

|Free cash flow margin|30.1%|34.2%|\~4 pts|

The stock price of Duolingo hovering at $270 is basically assuming the company’s growth over the next 5 years would only be at about 25%. If you take a look at the numbers above, the only thing that's under 25% are the monthly active users. The Company is projecting on its forward guidance about 35% YoY growth; which means the stock price is falling towards undervalued territory. The company has been growing at about 45% annually over the past 5 years, so yes a 35% growth on forward guidance does signal a decline in growth. But if you want to take the contrarian approach to the company, believing that AI will accelerate the growth of the company and Google means fuck all; this would be an amazing buying opportunity. 

P.S -This is not financial advice, I'm not a financial advisor. This is just my opinion on my projections of this company's stock price. If you buy high, panic, then sell low, too bad, sucks for you. Would recommend buying and holding the stock as we don't know how long this negative narrative will play out. (maybe **WRITING** covered calls OTM for a passive income) If you're a regard and you choose to gamble your life savings **Buying** OTM call options, good luck.

",64,67,1758299992.0,2025-09-19T16:39:52+00:00,t3_1nl8km0,"Duolingo DD  Dear, Ladies, gentleman and degenerate market regards

I’ve been doing a deep dive into one particular public company called Duolingo. You might be saying “wtf the language learning app?”. Yes correct, that app with the green owl. A company can be selling dog food for all I care, but if the numbers and the narrative are good, I'm buying. That being said, Duolingo ($DUOL) is slowly presenting an amazing opportunity as the stock price continues to fall. Opportunities like this is how life changing wealth is made. When everyone is betting on the downfall, you take the other side of that trade and bet against them all. The risk to reward ratio on this is too good to ignore.

Would also like to mention, if you’re an ape who has been buying into the hype of palantir with a disgusting 600 PE ratio, so high that you might as well buy your local pizza shop thats makes 100k a year for 50 million, then duolingo should not be a problem for you to take a chance on.

**The Narrative**

The bubble has officially popped on Duolingo due to rising fears of competitors entering the market. The two main competitors as of right now are OPENAI, and the tech giant GOOGLE.

Yes it can, but it's one of those scenarios where you want it to.

The P/E ratio of Duolingo was over 300 at its peak on May 15th 2025. Yes the company was way overvalued at the time for a growth company, (a fair valuation for growth companies range between (40-80) however the company is consistently beating earnings expectations and their free cash flow continues to rise higher and higher. Today that P/E ratio has dropped to 122 and its price to sales ratio has dropped to 15:1. Yes those numbers still do seem high, but 

as their free cash flow continues to rise, that P/E ratio will drop into fair valuations. Understand that this company is growing on average 40% year over year. For those who don't understand, markets are always forward looking. The institutions and retail investors who are buying into this company are betting on the fact that the over valuation numbers will drop as they consistently report good earnings, revenue and forward guidance.

**POSITION: 75% OF MY PORT.**

# THE CORE

* **SEARCH &amp; ADS (NOT A MONOPOLY KEK).**  This is the free-money printer.
* **THE WAR CHEST (CASH AND BUYBACKS)** They're sitting on **$100B+ IN CASH** making billions in interest. AND they're pumping their own stock with a **$70B BUYBACK** program.

# THE HYPER-GROWTH

* **GEMINI: #1 APP ON THE APPLE STORE.** Their model is already the best. Rumor is **Gemini 3.0 is going to eat even more ass**. They have the best photo editing, best video generation, and just bought windsurf. They are winning the AI race right now, and it's not even close. GPT5 worse than Gemini pro v2.5 lmaoooo.  Flash cost nothing and gemini will always offer this for free
   * ""**Transformers was one of research leadership. They gave the blueprint to the entire world in June 2017, and within 12-18 months, the entire AI industry, including Google itself, was building on it.**""
* **TPUs.** This is the hardware *literally built for LLMs* (which is half the stock market now).  They can start selling the shovels in a 20-trillion-dollar gold rush.
   * ""Google was using its own large-scale, custom AI hardware for two full years before its main competitor""
* **AI INCREASING MARGIN**  They're plugging this LLMS *directly into the ad engine* and this means higher margins on their main money-printer. They're using AI to make the printer go *faster*.
* **CLOUD** \- GCP is growing at **30%+ YOY** and is ripping market share straight from AWS and Azure. This is the growth engine.

# THE MOAT

* **YOUTUBE.** This is video, streaming, TV, *everything*. It's the most-watched platform in the world, and Shorts is knee-capping TikTok BY ORACLE

40,AAPL,$CRWV DD - CoreWeave is Low Balling Their Year End Guide by 22%-40% while $NBIS Has their Microsoft Deal Already Max Priced for 2025,"Contracts are nice but there is a major caveat -- How much can you actually scale to realize those revenues. Now, I am fully disclosing upfront that I expect NBIS to run a lot higher from here. I may be wrong but that's what I expect and that's my bet.

Still, Nebius trades at a premium when it comes to CoreWeave based on core cloud revenues. The price to annual recurring revenue is quite telling.

**Cloud revenue ratio**

* Metric | Q2 CRWV | Q2 NBIS | Ratio
* Cloud rev | $1.213B | $105.1M | \~11.5–12×

**Run-rate valuation (apples-to-apples)**

* Company | Market cap (we’re using: CRWV $48B; NBIS $22.9B) | ARR (cloud) | P/ARR
* CRWV | 48B | \~$4.85B | \~9.9×
* NBIS | 22.9B | \~$0.43B | \~53×

To be fair, post IPO lock-up there has been selling by insiders for CoreWeave that have had their share for a very long time. The disparity of the P/ARR is most likely due to that and not the debt financing. Sure people rail on that because they have nothing better to due but I assure you when the selling stops this stock will pop. Selling as of now is a momentum killer for CoreWeave.

With that being said, there is a reality and to me that reality is grounded by one fact alone. How much MegaWatts of power can you stand-up by end-of-year. Then to normalize that we can take current Q2 known revenues and apply them to what we know as being current standing powered shells or MW's.

It doesn't matter what the contracts are that are put into the backlog the game here is what can you actually bring online in terms of actively running powered shells. Literally the contracts are written this way. You don't come online-no pay, no delivered throughput of GPU'S - you don't get paid. If it's bad enough you can lose the entire contract.

Now, I am not totally sure what Nebius's current standing powered shell capacity is in terms of MW's but I am estimating somewhere between 40 - 55 current MW's. Remember the NJ Vineland rollout, which Microsoft just contracted to, is for that facility. If someone knows of another one please let me know. As of now, it's phase 1 2025 \~100 MW and phase 2 2026 \~100 MW although it is said can expand up to 300-MW and perhaps there will be great motivation for this. After all, Mark Zuckerberg did say he was putting up GPU tent cities.

The last thing before we get into graphs and figures. You'll begin to question the Microsoft contract for Nebius and how they will actually be able to achieve that without perhaps rolling into capacity handovers to CoreWeave or others just to buy them more time perhaps. Meaning, $17 billion can't possibly be a revenue for Nebius recognized in their quarters for probably 3 years or more.

This would be the major analyst question on upcoming Nebius calls that I want to hear the answer too. 100,200,300 MW isn't going to bring in more than what you are kind of guiding to on the top end of 2026 at 200 MW \~$500 - $700 M quarterly revenues by end of 2026. Surely that is not coming anywhere close in 2025. The contract is through 2031 but if they want to realize more of that revenue now then they are going to have to hurry and build and procure power as fast as humanly possible.

Again, this is a bit of an advantage for CoreWeave because they have so many data centers up and running and so many more coming online even in this year.

**NBIS NJ Vineland rollout and corresponding MSFT contract**

* Phase | Year | MW | Notes
* Phase 1 | 2025 | \~100 | contracted

So now that we have a normalized Revenue per MW or R / MW now we can analyze our second graph in earnest. For the Year-End-2025 this is where each company would be for their respective MegaWatt online completions.

Simply, CoreWeave is expected / guided to bring online &gt; 900 MW of total power active YE'25 and Nebius is expected to bring on \~100 MW of total power active YE'25.

**YE’25 MW &amp; implied Q4 cloud revenue**

* Company | YE MW target | Low/Mid/High $/MW | Implied Q4 rev
* (CRWV: &gt;900 MW; NBIS: \~100 MW)

https://preview.redd.it/ddmwt45o4cof1.png?width=2856&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=969a0198016c211b09af93d70da0a04a7dd3888b

Now what's interesting here is that one has guided to the top and one has low balled to the bottom.

If you use the $1.91 - $2.63M for Nebius you would assume on 100 MW of year-end power they would be at a Q4 revenue projection of $.19B - $.263B and their corresponding guide is $.225-$.275B per quarter. That is right in line and a little higher even for the maxed out scale of 100 MW by ye'25.

On the other hand, CoreWeave has a 22%(top)-40%(bottom) upside on their current ranged guide. So if we're tracking that's a massive whisper number that if they meaningfully bring more than 900 MW online we could see some pretty wild beats on the earnings heading into 2026.

* **CoreWeave:** Our implied **Q4 ≈ $2.32B**/qtr vs. guidance: **Q3 $1.26–$1.30B** and FY’25 **$5.15–$5.35B**, which implies **Q4 need ≈ $1.66–$1.90B**. So our figure is **\~22–40% above** the guidance-implied Q4.
* **Nebius:** Our implied **Q4 ≈ $0.19–$0.26B**/qtr vs. YE’25 **ARR guidance $0.9–$1.1B** (**≈$0.225–$0.275B per quarter**). So our figure is **within or just below** their guided band.

Visually this is what CoreWeave's surprise guides may yield.

https://preview.redd.it/9ieydcgq4cof1.png?width=2223&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=36683ef74b32c8604fe94c57a2a3057eb79a9362

Look at the comparison between both CoreWeave and NBIS in terms of where they are guiding per predicted active powered capabilities by year-end.

To illustrate the point here are two Q4 predictive sensitivity guides based on increases/decreases in R / MW.

CoreWeave could whisper out to a major upside because they're MW projection for revenue is coming in lowballed. Red is the current guide and black squares are the reasonably expected guide with powered shells coming online.

https://preview.redd.it/pztqi2nt4cof1.png?width=2001&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9a9bba8db0c4a99e3b749b21c7c4de473d1b6c1

For Nebius because they've guided so high you only can see an effective top end of their guide range.

https://preview.redd.it/mdnstgcw4cof1.png?width=2001&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2aa3212d3e485cd3f396d68d13aca4fb9a2a1a04

With all that said, and again with the caveat of CoreWeave is post IPO selling. How is the P/ARR not more normalized. At some point they either all go to \~10 or one raises and the other recedes. The sky is blue and the sun is white; yeah I know.

BUT can CoreWeave not have the luxury of a little more leeway to their P/ARR once the selling stops?

Here is what would happen if you averaged the too P/ARR's based on a stock price of $100 which is close to where they are today. Effectively, if CoreWeave had half of the P/ARR today this would give a multiple of x 3.34 on the stock price while reducing NBIS's share price by 1/3.

https://preview.redd.it/ugoj5opy4cof1.png?width=4132&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db3f116ec66411ca98debacca0496f03f41dd0d1

This is as of today what the stock price would be if CoreWeave had even close to what NBIS's P/ARR was. Overtime I expect they both settle into a P/ARR and then a P/E of about 15 - 25 if they are still aggressively growing.

If you have anything to add or corrections I will update the model forecasting.

This is not financial advice or advisor.

So now that we have a normalized Revenue per MW or R / MW now we can analyze our second graph in earnest. For the Year-End-2025 this is where each company would be for their respective MegaWatt online completions.

Simply, CoreWeave is expected / guided to bring online &gt; 900 MW of total power active YE'25 and Nebius is expected to bring on \~100 MW of total power active YE'25.

**YE’25 MW &amp; implied Q4 cloud revenue**

* Company | YE MW target | Low/Mid/High $/MW | Implied Q4 rev
* (CRWV: &gt;900 MW; NBIS: \~100 MW)

https://preview.redd.it/ddmwt45o4cof1.png?width=2856&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=969a0198016c211b09af93d70da0a04a7dd3888b

Now what's interesting here is that one has guided to the top and one has low balled to the bottom.

If you use the $1.91 - $2.63M for Nebius you would assume on 100 MW of year-end power they would be at a Q4 revenue projection of $.19B - $.263B and their corresponding guide is $.225-$.275B per quarter. That is right in line and a little higher even for the maxed out scale of 100 MW by ye'25.

On the other hand, CoreWeave has a 22%(top)-40%(bottom) upside on their current ranged guide. So if we're tracking that's a massive whisper number that if they meaningfully bring more than 900 MW online we could see some pretty wild beats on the earnings heading into 2026.

* **CoreWeave:** Our implied **Q4 ≈ $2.32B**/qtr vs. guidance: **Q3 $1.26–$1.30B** and FY’25 **$5.15–$5.35B**, which implies **Q4 need ≈ $1.66–$1.90B**. So our figure is **\~22–40% above** the guidance-implied Q4.
* **Nebius:** Our implied **Q4 ≈ $0.19–$0.26B**/qtr vs. YE’25 **ARR guidance $0.9–$1.1B** (**≈$0.225–$0.275B per quarter**). So our figure is **within or just below** their guided band.

Visually this is what CoreWeave's surprise guides may yield.

Look at the comparison between both CoreWeave and NBIS in terms of where they are guiding per predicted active powered capabilities by year-end.

To illustrate the point here are two Q4 predictive sensitivity guides based on increases/decreases in R / MW.

CoreWeave could whisper out to a major upside because they're MW projection for revenue is coming in lowballed. Red is the current guide and black squares are the reasonably expected guide with powered shells coming online.

https://preview.redd.it/pztqi2nt4cof1.png?width=2001&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9a9bba8db0c4a99e3b749b21c7c4de473d1b6c1

For Nebius because they've guided so high you only can see an effective top end of their guide range.

https://preview.redd.it/mdnstgcw4cof1.png?width=2001&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2aa3212d3e485cd3f396d68d13aca4fb9a2a1a04

With all that said, and again with the caveat of CoreWeave is post IPO selling. How is the P/ARR not more normalized. At some point they either all go to \~10 or one raises and the other recedes. The sky is blue and the sun is white; yeah I know.

BUT can CoreWeave not have the luxury of a little more leeway to their P/ARR once the selling stops?

Here is what would happen if you averaged the too P/ARR's based on a stock price of $100 which is close to where they are today. Effectively, if CoreWeave had half of the P/ARR today this would give a multiple of x 3.34 on the stock price while reducing NBIS's share price by 1/3.

https://preview.redd.it/ugoj5opy4cof1.png?width=4132&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db3f116ec66411ca98debacca0496f03f41dd0d1

This is as of today what the stock price would be if CoreWeave had even close to what NBIS's P/ARR was. Overtime I expect they both settle into a P/ARR and then a P/E of about 15 - 25 if they are still aggressively growing.

If you have anything to add or corrections I will update the model forecasting.

43,AAPL,Snap (SNAP): Acquisition Target or Dead Money?,"So Snap’s stock has been in free fall — down over 90% from the $80 peak in 2021, now sitting around $7. At the same time, the company still has ~469M daily active users, mostly Gen Z, who treat it like an operating system for their social life (AR lenses, Bitmoji, Maps, AI assistant, etc).

Here’s the case for why people think Snap is a buyout candidate:
	•	Valuation: Trading at one of the lowest price-to-sales multiples in social media. Dirt cheap compared to Meta, Pinterest, or TikTok’s implied value.
	•	User Base: Half a billion DAUs is nothing to sneeze at. Extremely sticky with younger demographics.
	•	Strategic Fit: Big tech (Google, Amazon, Apple, Disney, Netflix, etc) could bolt this onto their ecosystem. Rumors of Alphabet interest pre-IPO have floated before.
	•	Market Sentiment: Polls show a lot of retail/institutional investors believe Snap gets bought out in the next 1–2 years.

But here’s the catch:
	•	Founder Control: Evan Spiegel &amp; Bobby Murphy still hold ~96% of the voting power. If they don’t want to sell, it doesn’t matter how attractive the numbers look.
	•	Current Strategy: Snap’s been on offense, buying up smaller apps like Saturn (popular in U.S. high schools). That’s not what you do if you’re prepping for a sale.
	•	Execution Risk: Advertising headwinds, competition from TikTok/Instagram, and weak monetization continue to crush the stock.

TL;DR: On paper, Snap looks like one of the most attractive acquisition targets in tech cheap, highly engaged user base, potential fit for multiple buyers. But with founder control and ongoing internal growth moves, it’s far from a guaranteed outcome. If anything, it’s a speculative play on either a turnaround or someone eventually forcing their hand.

46,AAPL,"VKTX – Short Interest Sky High, Fundamentals Even Higher","I think I've found one of the most mispriced stocks right now in the market - VKTX. This is a 3bn pharma company. Their lotto ticket is the oral weight loss pill VK2735. 

1. High short interest 

The short interest is 27% and days to cover is entire week. This is like lighting a fire near a barrel of gas. If WSB really gets a hold of this stock as it has some of the other names in the past, it will become one that we look back on. 

2. Superior oral weight loss drug

It took 13 weeks for VK2735 to produce the same results as what took for Eli Lilly's drug Orfoglipron to do in 70ish weeks. That's insane when you think about it. Lilly's trial was a phase 3, whereas VKTX's was a phase 2 trial. VKTX will be moving to phase 3 next and they'll showcase even further weight loss with a full trial.

We don't have data (not released) from LLY of what the weight loss % was for their drug at 13 weeks. I suspect they wouldn't want to share that anyway - it wouldnt help them, and might only hurt them. Just putting that out there so that we are doing apples to apples comparisons. 


3. Massively underestimated and underrated

Eli Lilly today gained 30bn market cap after announcing they will proceed to seek approval for orfoglipron. That is 10x the market cap of VKTX. That's if VKTX announced they are ready to seek approval of their drug, they would shoot up from $25 to $250 per share price. 

Many top analysts have them at $80-120 price target. Raymond James, Jeffries, Oppenheimer all have $120+ price targets with BUY ratings. Morgan Stanley has them at $102. 

4. Side effects misunderstood / overreaction 

The reason they dropped recently is because there was a high rate of drop outs in the phase 2 trial. However, if you remember, this was a 13 week trial with fast titration. As a pharmacist, this class of medication is notorious for nausea if not titrated slowly. Their next phase of trial they will adjust these parameters and do a longer study. 

5. Buyout target

There are companies out there who want a piece of the pie of weight loss drugs because we are starting to realize that weight loss solves a whole host of other problems - liver, kidney, cardiovascular, and so on. Every day there is a new study published on these drugs that makes LLY jump or NVO jump. 

VKTX is considered one of the top buyout targets at the moment in the pharma space. They can easily clear a share price of $100 at least if announced a buyout. 

Top analysts from JP Morgan and Goldman sachs and others project the glp market to be a 50-100billion market by 2030. Even a third player to LLY and NVO can enjoy a big share of the pie without even having to outcompete them. 

6. With vktx oral pill, you can potentially achieve a rapid weight loss on the high doses and then switch to a lower maintenance dose, without even requiring injections. You can't do that with the competitor pills.

51,AAPL,I have strong belief that grandma's intel investment would have made sense if Grandma lived a bit longer and timed the market better.,":

EDIT : Forgot to mention that options are dirt cheap.  
EDIT 2 : Just to make it clear, the title is about that guy who invested a ridiculous amount of grandmas inheritance money  into Intel and lost like 10% instantly.

I'd like to start this post by saying I used to trade forex using supply/demand and Wyckoff strategy.  
Some of the reasons why I say I used to trade forex are your usual revenge trading, dropping strategy rules just to open a trade due to being impatient etc.  
All those mental challenges coupled with high leverage never turns out well.  
One thing I took out of that experience was definitely a strategy or two that I realised are worth gold while looking at stock price charts.  
Recently I managed to catch Roblox on a run up based on supply/demand strategy and I made couple of thousand % using options.  
All that being said,I believe I have the next big play.  
I want to start by saying that there are few reasons why I believe this is a high conviction play.

I base my opinion on technical and fundamental analysis.

Technical one goes as follows:

The higher time frame, the higher the conviction seems to be the case for the strategies I'm using  
I see a pattern of ""Wyckoff"" in particular : Accumulation being formed on the highest timeframe I've seen so far.  
I don't want to go too deep into what Wyckoff is: There is plenty of info here [https://www.wyckoffanalytics.com/wyckoff-method/](https://www.wyckoffanalytics.com/wyckoff-method/)  
You can briefly get the idea from the picture.  
Highly skilled traders can have a win rate using Wyckoff of upto 70% which is just crazy.

Fundamental :

There are few reasons as to why I believe Intel is going to see some green days;  
First being interest rates coming down as projected by few investment banks.  
Second being that Intel is being crushed by competitors and have unsuccessfully been playing catch-up game with them.  
The next chip ( Panther Lake) launch window is just around the corner (Late 2025 to early 2026).

Intel is trying to compete with TSMC by offering foundry services on its advanced 18A and 14A nodes.

If a major customer (e.g., Apple, Qualcomm, or even NVIDIA) commits to Intel Foundry, the stock could re-rate sharply

Japans SoftBank Group invested 2 billion into Intel.  
US Government is exploring an option of investing 2.2billion aswell.

I believe that Intel will reach 50 dollars no later then their 1st quarter 2026 earnings.

I'm going full Diamond Hands with this idea by buying these options.

Wish me luck because this pulling through would earn me part of the money I would buy my first property with.

I'd like to start this post by saying I used to trade forex using supply/demand and Wyckoff strategy.  
Some of the reasons why I say I used to trade forex are your usual revenge trading, dropping strategy rules just to open a trade due to being impatient etc.  
All those mental challenges coupled with high leverage never turns out well.  
One thing I took out of that experience was definitely a strategy or two that I realised are worth gold while looking at stock price charts.  
Recently I managed to catch Roblox on a run up based on supply/demand strategy and I made couple of thousand % using options.  
All that being said,I believe I have the next big play.  
I want to start by saying that there are few reasons why I believe this is a high conviction play.

I base my opinion on technical and fundamental analysis.

Technical one goes as follows:

The higher time frame, the higher the conviction seems to be the case for the strategies I'm using  
I see a pattern of ""Wyckoff"" in particular : Accumulation being formed on the highest timeframe I've seen so far.  
I don't want to go too deep into what Wyckoff is: There is plenty of info here [https://www.wyckoffanalytics.com/wyckoff-method/](https://www.wyckoffanalytics.com/wyckoff-method/)  
You can briefly get the idea from the picture.  
Highly skilled traders can have a win rate using Wyckoff of upto 70% which is just crazy.

Fundamental :

There are few reasons as to why I believe Intel is going to see some green days;  
First being interest rates coming down as projected by few investment banks.  
Second being that Intel is being crushed by competitors and have unsuccessfully been playing catch-up game with them.  
The next chip ( Panther Lake) launch window is just around the corner (Late 2025 to early 2026).

Intel is trying to compete with TSMC by offering foundry services on its advanced 18A and 14A nodes.

If a major customer (e.g., Apple, Qualcomm, or even NVIDIA) commits to Intel Foundry, the stock could re-rate sharply

Japans SoftBank Group invested 2 billion into Intel.  
US Government is exploring an option of investing 2.2billion aswell.

I believe that Intel will reach 50 dollars no later then their 1st quarter 2026 earnings.

I'm going full Diamond Hands with this idea by buying these options.

Wish me luck because this pulling through would earn me part of the money I would buy my first property with.

Not a financial advice.

52,AAPL,"Applied Materials drops 14%, worst drop since 2020, after weak forecast and China trade concerns","No paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/applied-materials-tumbles-china-woes-103649551.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/applied-materials-tumbles-china-woes-103649551.html)

(Bloomberg) -- Applied Materials Inc. suffered the worst single-day stock decline in five years after giving a disappointing sales and profit forecast, renewing concerns that the US trade dispute with China is weighing on demand.

Revenue will be approximately $6.7 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter, the company said in a statement Thursday. Analysts had estimated $7.32 billion on average. Profit will be about $2.11 a share, excluding some items, compared with a projection of $2.38.

Applied Materials, the largest American producer of chipmaking gear, is seeing less demand from customers in China, Chief Executive Officer Gary Dickerson said in an interview. It also faces delays in approval for exporting technology to that country, he said. Moreover, large customers are putting off some purchases in the face of prolonged negotiations around tariffs and other economic issues.

“It just creates a level of uncertainty,” Dickerson said.

The outlook sent shares of Applied Materials down 14% on Friday, the most since the early days of the pandemic in March 2020. They had been up 16% this year heading into the report.

In the third quarter, which ended July 27, revenue rose 7.7% to $7.3 billion. Analysts had anticipated $7.21 billion on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Profit was $2.48 a share, compared with an estimate of $2.36.

Applied Materials’ customer ranks include some of the biggest names in the chip industry, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Samsung Electronics Co. and Intel Corp. Those manufacturers order gear well ahead of starting production, making Applied Materials’ forecasts a barometer for future demand.

The company said last week that it would participate in an Apple Inc. plan to boost manufacturing in the US by spending more than $200 million on a facility in Arizona. Applied Materials will also sell equipment to Texas Instruments Inc.’s US factories to support Apple products.

“Applied Materials’ decision to be a core member of Apple’s ‘American Manufacturing Program,’ a drive to increase factory production within the US, could strengthen its position as a key supplier of chipmaking tools for advanced semiconductors used in iPhones,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Masahiro Wakasugi said in a note.

“The new administration is very focused on increasing semiconductor supply in the United States,” Dickerson said on Thursday. “We’re very positive.”

In July, rival Lam Research Corp. said revenue for the quarter ending in December would ease from the current-quarter levels, with Chinese customers potentially scaling back after a spending spree.

In a further sign of US-China tensions, Applied Materials was recently sued by Beijing E-Town Semiconductor Technology Co. over what that company characterized as trade secret theft.

Still, Dickerson said the long-term demand outlook for computing power remains strong. Customers in China had significantly ramped up buying in recent years, and are now just digesting those purchases, he said.",167,30,1755309938.0,2025-08-16T02:05:38+00:00,t3_1mrhn9m,"Applied Materials drops 14%, worst drop since 2020, after weak forecast and China trade concerns No paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/applied-materials-tumbles-china-woes-103649551.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/applied-materials-tumbles-china-woes-103649551.html)

54,AAPL,Going big on $GOOGL - Web and Ai giant!,"My positions: 1920 shares of $GOOGL. Kept on buying up so don't know what the average price is but around 190s.

Why: $GOOGL $GOOG is arguably one of the best AI companies out there. Google deepmind ( led by demis hasabis) is on par with openai and probably more better. Talent rich, cash rich, growing at scale and expanding.

Moonshots: 
1)Everyone talks about how search will die because of chatGPT etc. No! Earnings for the last 3 quarters have proved re-acceleration in search at almost 11% YoY.

2) YouTube now the most watched form of content. Almost all TV have it and YouTube shorts does 200b of views! Yotube is growing like crazy and content on it is proving to be better then most tv. The new generation will have also grown up on yotube and many have yotube subscription which is also a direct competitor of Spotify- you get free yotube music.

3) GCP - Google cloud. Growing like crazy. Now at $55b run rate. Sundar said they signed more $1B+ deal in the CURRENT quarter, then all of 2024!!! Examples include Salesforce, oracle, OpenAi ( yes them) for compute and GCP. They are growing rapidly due to TPU being super cheap and and cost effective. Constant reinvestment and growth will see them end up with a 100b business in cloud by 2028!!!

4) Gemini - google own LLm. On my benchmarks, this is one of the best models out there. This is being integrated into Google search view Ai overviews + Google ai mode search ( only india and usa have it) try it out. Not only that, they have the best video generation model and world models with Veo 3 &amp; genie 3. Gemini is becoming an enterprise software that many companies are embedding alongside cloud and GCP.

5) stabel growth segments - Google networks are not talked about. Android, play store, Google pixel,  watch and ear phone are in total $50b+ in annual revenue. The upcoming catalyst for this is Pixel 10 release with Google AI embedded in the phone. Google have also entered into the world of VR glasses that will be the most cost effective one. This will be in partnership with eye brand gentle monster who provide hardware for Google software. This will beat Apple ai vision pro and upcoming meta glasses on price point alone.

6) investment - Google are constantly investing into other business and themselves. They have just announced a $9b investment for data centres in Oklahoma. This is in addition to $25b for data centes in usa. They have also announced $6b projection near completion in India- a multi billion industry. They have given all kids in college free google tools and gemini pro to the value of $1B, and have projects going for google fiber for underwater sea cable networks. Rapid expansion across all vertices. They are investing into ai for drug discovery which had began human trials for cancer cures (isomorpic labs) and have constant investments into waymo - which is set to launch outside of USA and begin operations in Japan very soon. A stand alone valuation of waymo is around $150b.

Risk: The doj wants to break up google. They think it's a monopoly. The ruling is due anytime now. Given how unrealistic a break up is likely and could destroy google I don't see it happening. Even the prez of usa himself said he doesn't want them broken up,  he has said google is a innovative American company in tech conference a few weeks ago. I expect some remedial actions out of this which will life alot of risks from google.

Valuation: this is currently trading at cheapest valuation of 20x PE. OR 17x FWD P/E. The next mag 7 close go this is $meta at 29 PE.
A re rating could send $GOOGL on an nvida like run all the way to $280.

57,AAPL,$3M on Unity - My DD for U,"**Position**     

3000 call options for January 2026 with a 30 USD strike price; you can also see in my previous postings that I hadn’t sold when we were at almost $40 and then when it went all the way down, I added to my Unity position. 

  
**Disclaimer**

This isn’t financial advice. This is all just for your entertainment.

**TLDR of the TLDR**

Unity can do an AppLovin stock move if Unity’s new AI-Powered ad Platform Vector succeeds. So far, Vector has “far exceeded our expectations” according to the CEO Bromberg 1 week ago. My 1 year price target is $200. That would represent around half of AppLovin’s current market cap; their main competitor in the ad space. Unity powers 70% of mobile games with their engine (Unity software is on 2.5 billion devices - you read that right, read it again and maybe one more time. This also includes the China market… ), but until Vector they haven’t really capitalized on this potential moat. In the short-term gamma squeezes and even a short squeeze (9.28% shorted) are possible because various whales are buying OTM call options en masse and up to 88.26% of Unity is institutionally held and most positions have been made when the stock was over $100 (according to Fintel) which creates illiquidity as institutions likely won’t want to sell a turn-around stock in a bull market when they are still in the minus. In other words, if you bet on Unity, you are riding together with the whales. And if you think gaming has a future and ads will play a role, especially on mobile phones and VR (60% of VR games are made with Unity), and you are still here, you might as well read my intro and the TLDR. 

  
[https://images.fintel.io/us-u-so.png](https://images.fintel.io/us-u-so.png) 

  
**About me**

I went from 27k to 5M+ in less than 2 years (see my previous posts on WSB), but I also lost 180k back in the SPAC days and had to start again from scratch. This taught me that I should only invest in undervalued  companies that have some sort of actual moat. Previously I went with long-term calls into PLTR at around $8 and then into SOFI at around $7 (which btw at that time people also argued were overvalued). Unity is my third and only play. The rest I have in cash. My life hasn’t changed much (only my parents know and 2 friends), but whatever happens, I’ll be able to create an animal shelter for homeless dogs and other animals. 

**TLDR**

Unity is a turn-around, it has almost 0 interest from the retail community (try yourself and search on YouTube or X if anything received lots of interactions in the recent 1-2 years. This is good, because we are so early that no popular finfluencer is covering it), it’s actually even hated among retail because of Unity’s previous management and its runtime fee non-sense. Since their new CEO Bromberg took over 15 months ago, Unity not only reversed the runtime fee decisions, but also double beat on their earnings each time. Last week they did it again and analysts all upgraded Unity stock based on the most recent quarter. Still the stock is beaten down when you look at the 5 year chart (Unity used to trade above $200). I am not a technical trader, but I like beaten down stocks that are in the accumulation zone for years while the underlying company double beats each quarter and keeps growing. I like it even more when we are now witnessing the first great results of an AI product that hasn’t even started yet - Vector. It reminds me of when Palantir introduced their AIP bootcamps, their game changer. Ok, I tricked you. The TLDR of the TLDR and this TLDR are actually just an introduction. You might as well read the rest now. At least try to read the next sentence and see if it gets you hooked for more. 

**AppLovin, Unity’s main competitor**

AppLovin (Ticker APP - check out what their stock did in the last 12 months as inspiration) tried to buy Unity in 2022 for $58.85 per share and Unity rejected because they much rather wanted to compete with AppLovin in ads since Unity has the better moat (they provide the engine on which the games run). Based on some rumors they tried buying them a second time last year. However often AppLovin really tried to buy Unity, I am relieved that I could still invest in Unity. 

**Secret whale(s)**

In the background there’s an investor or multiple investors that have been putting $40M+ in the last few weeks on Unity OTM call options. Whoever that is, they got balls of steel as they are riding all ups and downs like a madman and keep accumulating. Yesterday alone around $10M was added to this Friday’s options chain. If Unity holds above $37.50 until Friday, we might see a gamma squeeze. Also, with up to 90% institutional ownership, where the majority is way underwater, thus likely not selling (which makes the stock illiquid) and Unity being almost 10% shorted, we might see a short squeeze. It’s not my main investment thesis, but definitely fun to watch this unfold. It’s still a big if, so don’t bet on it.      

**Unity and AppLovin experts**

If you don’t believe me because I am just claiming to be a wizard and can’t even write wizard, make sure to invest 3 hours of your time to watch 2 podcasts of the GameMakers (one is from Apr 8, 2025 and the other one is from June 10th, 2025; you can find it on YT) and watch how they are slowly changing their opinion full of skepticism towards Unity’s new Vector platform to seeing some potential opportunity for Unity to then 5 days ago Josh Chandley, Co-Founder at WildCard (mobile) Games, posting this:

Not surprisingly as the biggest engine provider in the world Unity is partnered with Apple, Google, Microsoft, Nintendo, Meta (for the Oculus) and Sony (for the PlayStation), but also with Tencent to help developers bring more games to China. They are also partnered with lots of other companies, even multiple car manufacturers (Mercedes-Benz, Toyota etc.) to create 3D models.

**Macro cycle**

We never know what Trump is up to and if we will get the next recession this year, next year or with the next president. But what we know is that we are at all-time-highs. Typically in all-time-highs the more speculative and smaller cap stocks go up. Unity fundamentally isn’t a highly speculative stock, but it is perceived as one. So, even if you think that we will soon have a recession, Unity might as well go up in the short-term. For the intermediate term in case of a recession, millions of people losing their jobs would cause what? 4 years ago when people lost their jobs and were at home they were playing (mobile) games and many programmers also created games. This was the time when Unity stock was above $200. And now with generative AI it will be even easier to create new mobile games. Unity is still the best game engine for new developers. In short, I am not too worried about Unity even if a recession hits anytime soon.  

**Unity red flag:**

Yes, I am honest here. There’s also something critical about Unity. I am fine with stock-based-compensation. That’s normal for such companies to keep talent and attract more talent. But when I read through Glassdoor reviews, Unity employees emphasize the great work-life-balance… Sorry, but if any Unity employees read this: AppLovin has eaten your breakfast, lunch and dinner in the last few years. True, you previously had really bad management. But now with your CEO Bromberg and Vector you have a real chance to eat their dessert. That’s the best food anyway. So, in the next 9-12 months keep pushing like never before to get it! I believe in unity. You have been waiting for this long enough.   ",1340,342,1755099148.0,2025-08-13T15:32:28+00:00,t3_1mp7nya,"$3M on Unity - My DD for U **Position**     

3000 call options for January 2026 with a 30 USD strike price; you can also see in my previous postings that I hadn’t sold when we were at almost $40 and then when it went all the way down, I added to my Unity position. 

  
**Disclaimer**

This isn’t financial advice. This is all just for your entertainment.

**TLDR of the TLDR**

Unity can do an AppLovin stock move if Unity’s new AI-Powered ad Platform Vector succeeds. So far, Vector has “far exceeded our expectations” according to the CEO Bromberg 1 week ago. My 1 year price target is $200. That would represent around half of AppLovin’s current market cap; their main competitor in the ad space. Unity powers 70% of mobile games with their engine (Unity software is on 2.5 billion devices - you read that right, read it again and maybe one more time. This also includes the China market… ), but until Vector they haven’t really capitalized on this potential moat. In the short-term gamma squeezes and even a short squeeze (9.28% shorted) are possible because various whales are buying OTM call options en masse and up to 88.26% of Unity is institutionally held and most positions have been made when the stock was over $100 (according to Fintel) which creates illiquidity as institutions likely won’t want to sell a turn-around stock in a bull market when they are still in the minus. In other words, if you bet on Unity, you are riding together with the whales. And if you think gaming has a future and ads will play a role, especially on mobile phones and VR (60% of VR games are made with Unity), and you are still here, you might as well read my intro and the TLDR.

**About me**

I went from 27k to 5M+ in less than 2 years (see my previous posts on WSB), but I also lost 180k back in the SPAC days and had to start again from scratch. This taught me that I should only invest in undervalued  companies that have some sort of actual moat. Previously I went with long-term calls into PLTR at around $8 and then into SOFI at around $7 (which btw at that time people also argued were overvalued). Unity is my third and only play. The rest I have in cash. My life hasn’t changed much (only my parents know and 2 friends), but whatever happens, I’ll be able to create an animal shelter for homeless dogs and other animals. 

**TLDR**

Unity is a turn-around, it has almost 0 interest from the retail community (try yourself and search on YouTube or X if anything received lots of interactions in the recent 1-2 years. This is good, because we are so early that no popular finfluencer is covering it), it’s actually even hated among retail because of Unity’s previous management and its runtime fee non-sense. Since their new CEO Bromberg took over 15 months ago, Unity not only reversed the runtime fee decisions, but also double beat on their earnings each time. Last week they did it again and analysts all upgraded Unity stock based on the most recent quarter. Still the stock is beaten down when you look at the 5 year chart (Unity used to trade above $200). I am not a technical trader, but I like beaten down stocks that are in the accumulation zone for years while the underlying company double beats each quarter and keeps growing. I like it even more when we are now witnessing the first great results of an AI product that hasn’t even started yet - Vector. It reminds me of when Palantir introduced their AIP bootcamps, their game changer. Ok, I tricked you. The TLDR of the TLDR and this TLDR are actually just an introduction. You might as well read the rest now. At least try to read the next sentence and see if it gets you hooked for more. 

**AppLovin, Unity’s main competitor**

AppLovin (Ticker APP - check out what their stock did in the last 12 months as inspiration) tried to buy Unity in 2022 for $58.85 per share and Unity rejected because they much rather wanted to compete with AppLovin in ads since Unity has the better moat (they provide the engine on which the games run). Based on some rumors they tried buying them a second time last year. However often AppLovin really tried to buy Unity, I am relieved that I could still invest in Unity. 

**Secret whale(s)**

In the background there’s an investor or multiple investors that have been putting $40M+ in the last few weeks on Unity OTM call options. Whoever that is, they got balls of steel as they are riding all ups and downs like a madman and keep accumulating. Yesterday alone around $10M was added to this Friday’s options chain. If Unity holds above $37.50 until Friday, we might see a gamma squeeze. Also, with up to 90% institutional ownership, where the majority is way underwater, thus likely not selling (which makes the stock illiquid) and Unity being almost 10% shorted, we might see a short squeeze. It’s not my main investment thesis, but definitely fun to watch this unfold. It’s still a big if, so don’t bet on it.      

**Unity and AppLovin experts**

If you don’t believe me because I am just claiming to be a wizard and can’t even write wizard, make sure to invest 3 hours of your time to watch 2 podcasts of the GameMakers (one is from Apr 8, 2025 and the other one is from June 10th, 2025; you can find it on YT) and watch how they are slowly changing their opinion full of skepticism towards Unity’s new Vector platform to seeing some potential opportunity for Unity to then 5 days ago Josh Chandley, Co-Founder at WildCard (mobile) Games, posting this:

Was out in the Grand Tetons dodging bears and overpriced bison burgers this week when I saw a local Wyoming news story on Ramaco Resources $METC. They just opened the Brook Mine on July 11 2025. First new rare earth mine in the US in over 70 years

CEO was on the news talking about how their rare earth deposit is easier to access than $MP. Said the material is in softer ground and they’re going to do processing onsite instead of shipping it overseas

He even compared it directly to $MP which already has deals with Apple and the DOD. That’s the kind of narrative that made $MP rip. And now the Pentagon is sniffing around Wyoming too

Meanwhile $METC is a coal company that already has strong cash flow. They’re not some cash burning startup hoping to maybe dig a hole. They’re mining now and using profits to fund this rare earth pivot

Stock is around $22 with a market cap just over $1B so it barely qualifies for WSB. It popped \~30 percent on the mine news but hasn’t gone full rocket mode yet. Low float. High volatility. RSI is hitting 96 levels right now

If this turns into even half of what $MP did it could run hard. Especially if they land a supply deal or anything that smells like national security. We’re in a tariff world and the US wants its own supply chain

**TLDR**

76,AAPL,Google’s AI Awakening: Earnings Bull Case,"# Beyond the AI hype, YouTube's dominance and a transforming Search business create a powerful, and potentially undervalued, growth story.

As Nvidia Corp. solidifies its position as a $4 trillion titan on the back of the AI hardware boom, a compelling debate is intensifying on Wall Street over what some see as a glaring valuation gap: Alphabet Inc., the parent company of Google.

While shares of the search giant have performed well, they have lagged the explosive, triple-digit gains of the companies building the ""picks and shovels"" of the AI revolution. This has led to a growing belief among some investors that Google, with its deeply integrated ""full stack"" of AI assets, is on the cusp of a significant re-rating. They are betting that the company’s upcoming second-quarter earnings report on July 23 will be the primary catalyst, forcing the market to shift its focus from the cost of Google's AI ambitions to the reality of its profits.

“For years, AI was a massive cost center for Google. The question for the second half of 2025 is whether it can become a massive profit center,” says one technology strategist. “Next week’s report is the first real test of that thesis.”

# The Unseen Competitor Winning the Streaming Wars

While investors have been fixated on Google's AI story, the recent earnings report from Netflix provided an inadvertent, and powerful, bull case for one of Google’s most valuable assets: YouTube.

Netflix’s management noted the intense competition for viewer engagement, and recent Nielsen data tells the story. In May, YouTube commanded 12.5% of all U.S. television screen time, significantly ahead of Netflix’s 7.5%. This data confirms that YouTube is not just a mobile video app, but the dominant media platform in the modern living room.

Financially, the scale is staggering. YouTube’s advertising revenue alone, at over $34 billion annually, is nearly the size of Netflix’s entire global enterprise. When combined with an estimated $19 billion in subscription revenue from YouTube Premium and YouTube TV, a hypothetical standalone “YouTube Inc.” would be a media behemoth with over $53 billion in annual sales, far outpacing its rivals.

“Netflix’s earnings call was inadvertently the best bull case for YouTube we’ve seen all year,” noted one portfolio manager. “It confirmed who truly owns the living room, and that value has yet to be fully unlocked in Alphabet’s stock price.”

# The Bear Case Reimagined: Search as an AI Utility

A persistent fear among investors has been that AI chatbots would cannibalize Google’s core Search business, which remains its primary source of profit. A contrarian view is now emerging, however, that AI will not be a threat, but rather Search's greatest accelerator.

This thesis posits that as Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI agents become more prevalent, they will need constant access to the live, indexed web to provide up-to-date, reliable information. The most efficient and trusted source for that data is Google's Search index.

Under this model, the biggest new customers for Google Search may not be humans, but other AIs. This could transform the Search business from a consumer-facing advertising platform into a foundational “Search as a Service” utility for the entire AI economy, monetized through high-margin, programmatic API access.

“The fear was that the search box would die,” says a tech strategist. “The reality may be that the underlying Search index becomes the foundational data layer for the entire AI ecosystem—a far more valuable position.”

# The Path to $3 Trillion

For Google to close the valuation gap with its peers, investors believe the market must recognize the value of its interconnected empire. A ""sum-of-the-parts"" analysis reveals immense potential: a dominant media company in YouTube, a profitable and growing Cloud business, and a portfolio of high-risk, high-reward ""Other Bets"" like the autonomous driving unit, Waymo.

The ultimate validation of its AI leadership could come from a partnership with its biggest rival. Persistent rumors of Apple integrating Google's Gemini into iOS for advanced AI tasks draw a direct parallel to the estimated $20 billion annual deal Google pays Apple for its search default status. Such a deal would instantly cement Gemini's position as the indispensable intelligence layer for the mobile world.

The narrative for the past year has rightfully celebrated the companies building the infrastructure for AI. The bull case for Google is a bet that the focus is about to shift to the companies that can most effectively monetize it. Investors will be watching closely on July 23rd for the answer.

  
**TL;DR:**

* **Google is likely undervalued.** The market has rewarded AI hardware companies like Nvidia but hasn't yet priced in Google's ability to profit from its ""full-stack"" AI ecosystem. The July 23rd earnings report is the key catalyst to prove this.
* **YouTube is quietly winning the streaming wars.** It has more viewing time than Netflix, making it a dominant media empire whose massive value is not fully reflected in Google's stock price.
* **The ""AI is a threat to Search"" narrative is likely wrong.** The opposite is more probable: AI agents will become massive new customers, using the Google Search index as the essential data layer for the entire AI economy, creating a new, high-margin business.
* **For the first time, real revenue from AI subscriptions (Gemini, Veo) will be reported.** This shifts the story from ""AI is an expense"" to ""AI is a profit engine.""
* **A potential multi-billion dollar deal for Apple to use Gemini** (similar to their current Search deal) is a massive, often overlooked catalyst that would cement Google's AI supremacy.

I try to scale out of the position over the course of 2-10 trading days. I'm happy with 20%-50% gains and am fine with leaving money on the table.

Rating: **OVERWEIGHT** | Price Target: $120 (216% upside within 12 months) | Risk: **MEDIUM-HIGH**


**INVESTMENT THESIS SUMMARY**

We identify a high-probability convergence scenario whereby Apple Inc. announces a strategic nuclear partnership with NuScale Power within the next 1-45 days. Our analysis indicates this represents one of the most compelling asymmetric risk/reward opportunities in the current market, driven by simultaneous insider trading blackouts, regulatory catalysts, and Trump administration nuclear policy alignment.

Key Investment Highlights:

	•	Regulatory Moat: NuScale remains the only SMR with full Nuclear Regulatory Commission design certification
	•	Political Tailwinds: Trump’s May 23 executive orders create explicit framework for hyperscaler nuclear partnerships
	•	Corporate Necessity: Apple’s $500B AI infrastructure investment requires reliable baseload power
	•	Timing Convergence: 44-day Apple insider blackout + 27-day NuScale blackout suggests imminent announcement


**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

The convergence of corporate necessity (Apple’s AI energy demands), regulatory positioning (NuScale’s certification advantage), and political framework (Trump’s nuclear renaissance agenda) creates what we believe to be a generational investment opportunity. Our 30-day analysis reveals multiple validation points that have exponentially strengthened since thesis inception.

Base Case Scenario (70% probability): Apple-NuScale partnership announcement drives 200-300% appreciation

Bull Case Scenario (25% probability): Broader nuclear renaissance positioning drives 400-500% appreciation

Bear Case Scenario (5% probability): No partnership with any major player materializes, limited downside given current valuation ($20-$25/share)


**CONVERGENCE ANALYSIS**

Corporate Strategic Alignment
Apple’s AI Infrastructure Imperative: The company’s February $500B investment commitment includes data center expansion across nine states, requiring significant baseload power. Unlike hyperscaler peers (Meta, Microsoft, Google) who have secured nuclear partnerships, Apple represents the largest unpartnered AI infrastructure player.
NuScale’s Competitive Positioning: As the only NRC-certified SMR provider with manufacturing capabilities (12 modules in production via Doosan partnership), NuScale possesses an unassailable regulatory moat that becomes increasingly valuable as hyperscaler nuclear demand accelerates.

Political Economy Framework
Trump’s nuclear executive orders create unprecedented policy support for private-sector nuclear partnerships, particularly those supporting AI infrastructure. The administration’s goal of 400 GW nuclear capacity by 2050 requires massive private investment, making high-profile corporate partnerships politically essential for demonstrating market viability.

Insider Trading Pattern Analysis
The simultaneous 44-day Apple blackout (unprecedented duration) and 27-day NuScale blackout (beginning immediately post-Nuclear Regulatory Commission approval) represents statistically anomalous corporate behavior consistent with major strategic transaction negotiations.


**FINANCIAL MODELING &amp; VALUATION**

Revenue Impact Analysis

	•	Single Apple Partnership: $2-5B annual contract value over 20 years
	•	Market Validation Effect: Additional hyperscaler partnerships following Apple announcement
	•	Manufacturing Scale: Doosan partnership capable of 20+ modules annually (as of deal signing in 2023)

Ownership Structure Validation (from 2024 10-K)

	•	Fluor Corporation (47%): Military-industrial complex alignment provides execution credibility
	•	Japan NuScale Innovation (7%): International strategic validation
	•	Management Quality: CEO John Hopkins’ U.S. Chamber of Commerce positioning demonstrates policy navigation capabilities


**RISK/REWARD ASSESSMENT**

Asymmetric Setup Characteristics

	•	Multiple Success Pathways: Partnership, acquisition, or broader nuclear adoption all drive appreciation
	•	Limited Downside: Current valuation reflects minimal nuclear renaissance expectations
	•	Leveraged Exposure: SMR sector concentration amplifies any positive catalysts

Catalyst Timeline

	•	Immediate (1-45 days): Partnership announcement probability
	•	Medium-term (2-12 months): Nuclear renaissance policy implementation
	•	Long-term (2-5 years): Commercial deployment and revenue generation


**INVESTMENT COMMITTEE Q&amp;A**

Q: Dependency on corporate execution - what if Apple/NuScale partnership doesn’t materialize?

Response: This concern misunderstands the anthropological drivers at play. Tim Cook’s psychology operates on legacy positioning - he will not allow Apple to fall behind in the infrastructure arms race that defines AI leadership. Hopkins, as a Chamber of Commerce-embedded operator, understands that first-mover partnerships with Apple create market validation that benefits NuScale regardless of subsequent deal flow.
The convergence isn’t dependent on corporate whim - it’s driven by structural necessity. Apple needs nuclear, NuScale has the only certified solution, and Trump’s framework removes regulatory barriers. Even if this specific partnership fails, the thesis benefits from multiple pathways: government acquisition, other hyperscaler partnerships, or broader nuclear adoption all drive similar outcomes.

Q: Political risk - what if Trump’s priorities shift away from nuclear?

Response: Trump’s ego architecture makes nuclear reversal psychologically impossible. He’s publicly committed to “American energy dominance” and 400 GW nuclear capacity - reversing course would contradict his core political identity. More importantly, Hopkins understands the political machine through his Chamber positioning. The nuclear renaissance isn’t just Trump policy - it’s bipartisan infrastructure necessity driven by AI competition with China.
Nuclear power represents Trump’s ability to simultaneously claim “America First” energy independence and technological superiority. These are core psychological drivers that don’t shift with news cycles. The framework is locked in place by Trump’s legacy needs.

Q: Regulatory timing risk - Nuclear Regulatory Commission approval doesn’t guarantee deployment certainty

Response: This assumes static regulatory environment, which misreads the political moment. Trump’s executive orders explicitly direct agencies to expedite nuclear deployment and establish categorical NEPA exclusions. Hopkins’ background suggests he’s positioned for regulatory navigation - not regulatory compliance gambling.
The May 29 Nuclear Regulatory Commission approval timing (immediately before insider blackouts) suggests coordination between regulatory completion and commercial announcement. This isn’t speculative - it’s orchestrated regulatory theater designed to create deployment certainty. The political framework eliminates traditional regulatory uncertainty.

Q: Market efficiency - if this is obvious, why isn’t it already priced in?

Response: Market efficiency assumes perfect information distribution, which fails with multi-dimensional convergence analysis. The pattern requires simultaneously tracking: insider trading behavior, regulatory timelines, political anthropology, and corporate strategic necessities. Most analysts operate in single-factor frameworks.
Additionally, the 30-day research depth required to identify this convergence exceeds typical institutional attention spans. Market makers have micro-timing advantages but lack macro-convergence pattern recognition. The information is public, but the interpretive sophistication required creates genuine asymmetry.
The psychological timing also matters - announcing before July 4 maximizes political impact while minimizing opposition organization time. This level of strategic timing analysis exceeds normal market efficiency assumptions.
This convergence represents genuine analytical edge, not market inefficiency exploitation.


RECOMMENDATION

OVERWEIGHT rating with 3-5% portfolio allocation for aggressive growth mandates. The combination of regulatory positioning, political tailwinds, and corporate necessity creates exceptional asymmetric opportunity with institutional-quality risk management potential.

***TECHNICAL ANALYSIS VALIDATION/CONVERGENCE***

Ascending Triangle Formation

The target security exhibits a textbook ascending triangle pattern with compelling technical characteristics that independently validate our fundamental catalyst timeline.

Pattern Structure:

	•	Horizontal resistance: Consistent rejection at $45.31 level over multiple tests since early June
	•	Rising support trendline: Higher lows pattern from $29.45 base indicating systematic accumulation behavior
	•	Volume compression: Decreasing volatility range suggesting institutional positioning ahead of known catalyst
	•	Apex convergence: Pattern completion anticipated within 3-6 trading days

Institutional Significance:

The ascending triangle represents more than technical pattern recognition - it demonstrates institutional anticipation of our identified catalyst events. The rising support trendline indicates smart money accumulation at progressively higher prices, suggesting advance knowledge of pending announcements. Volume analysis reveals institutional-size block trading concentrated at key support levels, consistent with strategic positioning rather than retail speculation.

Catalyst Alignment Validation:

The technical pattern convergence timing provides independent confirmation of our fundamental analysis. The 3-6 day apex timing aligns precisely with:

	•	Trump’s July 4th symbolic opportunity window
	•	Apple’s 44-day insider blackout approaching natural conclusion
	•	Political necessity for immediate manufacturing narrative wins

This convergence represents what technical analysts call “smart money confirmation” - when institutional behavior validates fundamental thesis timing through observable market mechanics.
Breakout Probability Assessment:
Ascending triangles historically resolve upward in 70-80% of cases, with breakout magnitude typically correlating to pattern duration and volume compression intensity. The current formation demonstrates:

	•	4-week consolidation period: Extended enough to absorb selling pressure
	•	Multiple resistance tests: Each rejection followed by higher low formation
	•	Volume contraction: Institutional accumulation without retail distribution

Price Target Methodology:

Technical analysis provides multiple target frameworks:

	•	Initial breakout objective: $60+ (33% above $45.31 resistance, representing gap-fill to prior highs)
	•	Measured move calculation: $75-85 (pattern height of ~$16 projected from breakout point)
	•	Fundamental convergence target: $120 (enterprise value analysis of strategic partnership implications)

The technical setup suggests the initial breakout could reach $60-65 within days of catalyst announcement, with fundamental revaluation driving appreciation toward the $120 enterprise value target over subsequent quarters.

Information Asymmetry Evidence:

Perhaps most significantly, the ascending triangle formation demonstrates market anticipation of our identified catalysts. The pattern suggests institutional players possess advance knowledge of pending announcements, creating the exact information asymmetry that generates exceptional investment returns. The technical behavior validates our insider blackout analysis and political timing thesis through independent market confirmation.
This technical validation transforms our fundamental analysis from theoretical possibility into market-confirmed probability, with institutional positioning behavior providing real-time verification of our catalyst timeline accuracy.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

This convergence represents genuine analytical edge, not market inefficiency exploitation.


RECOMMENDATION

OVERWEIGHT rating with 3-5% portfolio allocation for aggressive growth mandates. The combination of regulatory positioning, political tailwinds, and corporate necessity creates exceptional asymmetric opportunity with institutional-quality risk management potential.

Price Target: $120 (12-month horizon)
Catalyst Timeline: 1-45 days for initial validation
Analyst: (redacted) | Publication Date: June 26, 2025


***TECHNICAL ANALYSIS VALIDATION/CONVERGENCE***

Ascending Triangle Formation

The target security exhibits a textbook ascending triangle pattern with compelling technical characteristics that independently validate our fundamental catalyst timeline.

Pattern Structure:

	•	Horizontal resistance: Consistent rejection at $45.31 level over multiple tests since early June
	•	Rising support trendline: Higher lows pattern from $29.45 base indicating systematic accumulation behavior
	•	Volume compression: Decreasing volatility range suggesting institutional positioning ahead of known catalyst
	•	Apex convergence: Pattern completion anticipated within 3-6 trading days

Institutional Significance:

The ascending triangle represents more than technical pattern recognition - it demonstrates institutional anticipation of our identified catalyst events. The rising support trendline indicates smart money accumulation at progressively higher prices, suggesting advance knowledge of pending announcements. Volume analysis reveals institutional-size block trading concentrated at key support levels, consistent with strategic positioning rather than retail speculation.

Catalyst Alignment Validation:

The technical pattern convergence timing provides independent confirmation of our fundamental analysis. The 3-6 day apex timing aligns precisely with:

	•	Trump’s July 4th symbolic opportunity window
	•	Apple’s 44-day insider blackout approaching natural conclusion
	•	Political necessity for immediate manufacturing narrative wins

This convergence represents what technical analysts call “smart money confirmation” - when institutional behavior validates fundamental thesis timing through observable market mechanics.
Breakout Probability Assessment:
Ascending triangles historically resolve upward in 70-80% of cases, with breakout magnitude typically correlating to pattern duration and volume compression intensity. The current formation demonstrates:

	•	4-week consolidation period: Extended enough to absorb selling pressure
	•	Multiple resistance tests: Each rejection followed by higher low formation
	•	Volume contraction: Institutional accumulation without retail distribution

Price Target Methodology:

Technical analysis provides multiple target frameworks:

	•	Initial breakout objective: $60+ (33% above $45.31 resistance, representing gap-fill to prior highs)
	•	Measured move calculation: $75-85 (pattern height of ~$16 projected from breakout point)
	•	Fundamental convergence target: $120 (enterprise value analysis of strategic partnership implications)

The technical setup suggests the initial breakout could reach $60-65 within days of catalyst announcement, with fundamental revaluation driving appreciation toward the $120 enterprise value target over subsequent quarters.

Information Asymmetry Evidence:

Perhaps most significantly, the ascending triangle formation demonstrates market anticipation of our identified catalysts. The pattern suggests institutional players possess advance knowledge of pending announcements, creating the exact information asymmetry that generates exceptional investment returns. The technical behavior validates our insider blackout analysis and political timing thesis through independent market confirmation.
This technical validation transforms our fundamental analysis from theoretical possibility into market-confirmed probability, with institutional positioning behavior providing real-time verification of our catalyst timeline accuracy.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

94,AAPL,Apple delays Siri AI upgrade to Spring 2026,"Apple Inc. has set an internal release target of spring 2026 for its delayed upgrade of Siri, marking a key step in its artificial intelligence turnaround effort. 

The company’s Siri team is aiming to bring the revamped voice assistant to market as part of an iOS 26.4 software update, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The long-promised changes will allow Siri to tap into consumers’ personal data and on-screen activities in order to better fulfill queries.

Apple’s “.4” updates — known as “E” on the company’s internal software development schedule — are typically released in March. That was the case with iOS 18.4 this year and iOS 17.4 in 2024. But an exact date hasn’t been set internally for the software, beyond a spring time frame, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the work is private. 

Apple, in response to a request for comment, said it hasn’t announced exact timing for the new Siri features. It reiterated earlier statements that the upgrades are planned for the “coming year.”

The timeline could still shift depending on whether new snags emerge. If the next several weeks of development work proves promising, the company could consider giving a preview of the features when it launches the next iPhones in the fall, one of the people said, though no final decisions have been made.

The upgrade has been a long time coming. Apple originally introduced the next-generation Siri features at its Worldwide Developers Conference in June of last year. The idea was to modernize the voice assistant — first introduced in 2011 — which hasn’t kept pace with chatbots and other AI tools.

The technology in the works also includes a system called App Intents that allows Siri to more precisely control applications and in-app actions across Apple devices.

If the latest release timing sticks, Apple will have gone nearly two years between announcing the new Siri and delivering it to customers. It’s been an especially high-profile delay because the capabilities were part of the iPhone 16 marketing last year — despite the new Siri not being close to ready. 

Within Apple, the original goal was to have the Siri features ready in the fall of 2024, alongside the new iPhone. The target then shifted to spring 2025. The company had privately expected a rollout as part of iOS 18.4, before moving the target again to May with iOS 18.5.

101,AAPL,why GOOGL (Alphabet) is a great buy right now,"With WWDC and the Robotaxi event next week, I'd like to discuss Google and its parent company Alphabet, they have been in trouble for a while now regarding some bullshit anti-trust cases, and I want to tell you why its pure FUD.  Google has really caught up with the rest of the Mag 7 giants in their AI advancements if you haven't noticed.  They have been doing AI machine learning since 2001.  Bard was unimpressive, but that was only little over a year ago.  The speed at which they have been making new advancements is almost hard to track (even across other LLM's).

Have you tried Gemini?  VEO 3 costs 250/m and people are loving it. (the rev. from that will be great as well) and the new AI mode for search seems to finally have been embraced and I think they can actually leverage AI to better serve people the right business ads / referrals.  ***Either way they are monetizing AI***\*...\*

Regarding all the FUD, I dont believe the judge can make them sell chrome, EU case is just stupid, the whole thing is about them having monopoly on search and ads...  well there is Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo, Perplexity, Meta / Instagram business Ads, etc..  they have no monopoly anymore if there was one...

I dont believe the cases will result in anything materially bad for the stock but nobody can be sure, so that is why I want to dig into the Fundmental and Technical Analysis.

# ----------- Fundamentals -----------

Alphabet is a massive conglomerate with many subsidiaries.  Lets talk about how they are competing and kicking ass in so many different industries.

\-

**AI:**  

*VEO 3, AI Mode, Gemini, DeepMind* \- Competing with GPT pro, Microsoft, etc.  (note VEO 3 is still the only model that does text to video PLUS audio.  I think they leveraged youtube for it.

**Data Centers / Internet Provider:**

\-----*Google Cloud, TPU's, Google Fiber* \-Competing with many, but their TPU's are very good for AI data centers, and google Fiber competes with internet / service providers like AT&amp;T / Comcast / T-Mobile, etc..

**Quantum Computing:**

\------Competing with Microsoft, IBM, Rigetti, etc.

**Smart Phones:**

\------*Android, Pixel Phone* (with Gemini that kicks Siri's ass) - competing with Apple big-time

**Streaming / Ads:**

\------*Youtube &amp; Google Ads* \- Competing with Meta and Netflix

**Smart Home / Wearables:**

\------*Nest, Fitbit,* &amp; ***XR Glasses*** \- Competing with Amazon, Apple's announced glasses and their 'watch', Microsoft, etc.

**Autonomous Driving / UAV Delivery:**

\------***Waymo, Wing*** \- Competing with Tesla (been kicking their ass on it for a while now), GM, and yes, Amazon Air delivery.  *They also just announced another partnership with Walmart to bring more drones to over 100 stores for deliveries!*

**AI in Healthcare / Biotech:**

\------*Verily, &amp; Calico* \- working on aging / genetics and ai in healthcare.

\-*and probably a few others i've missed..*.  but the scope of their work is clear.

\-

When you buy GOOGL you are buying the entirety of Alphabets investments.  And they are so well positioned from a fundamental and financial perspective as seen in this group of charts.  They make double nearly double the revenue of Nvidia...

[Google makes more revenue than the rest of the Mag 7, nearly double Nvidia's earnings!  the only exception of Apple which could be in jeopardy too if they dont continue to innovate.](https://preview.redd.it/i61ok3bywl5f1.png?width=1183&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab383da02f61b9d5fdc7bb71ce2bde6c7d453ac2)

\-

Yet oddly, Google has the lowest P/E (price to earnings) ratio than the rest of the Mag 7!  That seems off if you ask me.  I believe they can take plenty of market share back in the future based on these 2 figures.

I know there are a lot of lines and colors, dont be scared.  The indicators I use are patterns combined with price action, fib levels, TTM squeeze, RSI and some other factors such as price gaps.

\- With RSI, above/below the 50 line tells you if momentum is bullish or bearish.  All the higher timeframes are above that 50 line indicating a potential bullish reversal.

\- With TTM it makes it easier to visualize these momentum shifts.  Right now my focus is on that Weekly chart on the bottom right - higher time frames are usually more important and it appears to be on the verge of a weekly breakout.  Now with a stock like this it could take months to reach that earnings Gap and make a new all time high.  When or If this happens depends on a lot of factors, but I am only focusing on the chart.

\- The Fibonacci Retracements I mostly use for the 50% line to determine if the price has had a change of trend.  Right now the price is attempting a breakout above this retracement and if it can break over 175 then there is plenty of room up.

\- Ive also illustrated some patterns and concepts on the chart.  Inverted Head and Shoulders, Trendline Break, Higher Highs and Higher Lows, potentially an even larger inverted H&amp;S on the daily chart to the top right.

Ok so what does this technical analysis mumbo jumbo mean?  Its hard to say because of Trump, Tarrifs, Deals, Interest Rates, Bonds, Geopolitics, the fact that the market has already just about reached all time highs and this is lagging...  it is concerning.  It could also just be setting up for a massive (bearish) head and shoulders as you might notice on the bottom right weekly chart.

But with WWDC, RoboTaxi, and several trump deals supposedly taking place next week, we could be setup for some bullish continuation if these tech events impress.  Either way, Long Term I believe Google / Alphabet stock will get back to 200.

From a technical and fundamental perspective they are in great shape.  I would even bet that if the market pulls back, that institutions may rotate their Mag 7 holdings into the laggards such as this and Amazon.

While they are aggressively competing with so many different companies and industries, their earnings are expected to continue to grow and as you saw earlier, they earn double what Nvidia earns... Pelosi still has calls, and lets face it, you still use some kind of google product in your life whether its youtube, your android based phone, ai / gemini research, waymo, etc...  I believe Google is well positioned to be a winner this year in AI and many of its subsidiary company products.

\--------------

# TLDR:

**Alphabet is a great Bet !**

I currently am selling put credit spreads on GOOGL, and have several 180 calls for 7/18 that I only plan to hold through next week before I re-enter as there is going to be a lot going on next week for the markets.  Their earnings are on 7/22 I believe, so August may be a better strike date.  Shares or LEAPS (calls dated atleast for 2026) are also a good idea IMO, you can sell calls against them to hedge when there are large spikes.

**Anyway, I am highly regarded** ***and this is not financial advice,*** but I am very bullish on Google long term.  Its not an easy one to trade if you like short dated options, you need patience, but the chart, the p/e ratios, the incredible amount of subsidiaries competing with more than other Mag 7 companies makes this thing a highly undervalued growth &amp; value stock.

Google has really caught up with the rest of the Mag 7 giants in their AI advancements if you haven't noticed.  They have been doing AI machine learning since 2001.  Bard was unimpressive, but that was only little over a year ago.  The speed at which they have been making new advancements is almost hard to track (even across other LLM's).

Have you tried Gemini?  VEO 3 costs 250/m and people are loving it. (the rev. from that will be great as well) and the new AI mode for search seems to finally have been embraced and I think they can actually leverage AI to better serve people the right business ads / referrals.  ***Either way they are monetizing AI***\*...\*

Regarding all the FUD, I dont believe the judge can make them sell chrome, EU case is just stupid, the whole thing is about them having monopoly on search and ads...  well there is Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo, Perplexity, Meta / Instagram business Ads, etc..  they have no monopoly anymore if there was one...

I dont believe the cases will result in anything materially bad for the stock but nobody can be sure, so that is why I want to dig into the Fundmental and Technical Analysis.

# ----------- Fundamentals -----------

Alphabet is a massive conglomerate with many subsidiaries.  Lets talk about how they are competing and kicking ass in so many different industries.

\-

**AI:**  

*VEO 3, AI Mode, Gemini, DeepMind* \- Competing with GPT pro, Microsoft, etc.  (note VEO 3 is still the only model that does text to video PLUS audio.  I think they leveraged youtube for it.

**Data Centers / Internet Provider:**

\-----*Google Cloud, TPU's, Google Fiber* \-Competing with many, but their TPU's are very good for AI data centers, and google Fiber competes with internet / service providers like AT&amp;T / Comcast / T-Mobile, etc..

**Quantum Computing:**

\------Competing with Microsoft, IBM, Rigetti, etc.

**Smart Phones:**

\------*Android, Pixel Phone* (with Gemini that kicks Siri's ass) - competing with Apple big-time

**Streaming / Ads:**

\------*Youtube &amp; Google Ads* \- Competing with Meta and Netflix

**Smart Home / Wearables:**

\------*Nest, Fitbit,* &amp; ***XR Glasses*** \- Competing with Amazon, Apple's announced glasses and their 'watch', Microsoft, etc.

**Autonomous Driving / UAV Delivery:**

\------***Waymo, Wing*** \- Competing with Tesla (been kicking their ass on it for a while now), GM, and yes, Amazon Air delivery.  *They also just announced another partnership with Walmart to bring more drones to over 100 stores for deliveries!*

**AI in Healthcare / Biotech:**

\------*Verily, &amp; Calico* \- working on aging / genetics and ai in healthcare.

\-*and probably a few others i've missed..*.  but the scope of their work is clear.

\-

When you buy GOOGL you are buying the entirety of Alphabets investments.  And they are so well positioned from a fundamental and financial perspective as seen in this group of charts.  They make double nearly double the revenue of Nvidia...

[Google makes more revenue than the rest of the Mag 7, nearly double Nvidia's earnings!  the only exception of Apple which could be in jeopardy too if they dont continue to innovate.](https://preview.redd.it/i61ok3bywl5f1.png?width=1183&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab383da02f61b9d5fdc7bb71ce2bde6c7d453ac2)

\-

Yet oddly, Google has the lowest P/E (price to earnings) ratio than the rest of the Mag 7!  That seems off if you ask me.  I believe they can take plenty of market share back in the future based on these 2 figures.

I am a senior level IC at a FAANG and deal with AI regularly and I only buy stocks in things I deal with and understand.

I looked into this when my wife came home with the wrong type of thumb drive for her stupid Macbook (a Sandisk that requires a USB - thank you Apple for removing those fucking ports on everything). Was curious if this was a company I could short and then learned what they were doing. Now I think this is a sleeper pick that nobody's really paying attention to.

**Product deep dive:**

* NVIDIA certified Sandisk’s Gen5 eSSDs for datacenter use. Certification means they're officially in the vendor chain for AI servers.
* Additionally, they've also built something called High Bandwidth Flash (HBF) which is a new memory architecture built for massive memory capacity and throughput (important for AI). Nobody else is making this and it's developed in-house (one of the main reasons I bought).
* Sandisk is shipping one of the most power-efficient flash technologies available right now, BiCS8.
* Cloud sales—12% of Sandisk’s total output went to AWS/GCP/Azure this quarter, up from 8% a year ago. My employer is one of these and our AI spend is essentially a blank check. It's kind of an arms race right now.
* AI spend isn't going to stop. I work in a part of a FAANG where we're seeing complete transformation plans to overhaul our customer-facing service into an AI-heavy experience. Yes a lot of companies are bleeding money on this but a lot aren't. I see the sales numbers and the internal productivity boost we've gotten is insane.

**Brand shift:**

Yes they do still make consumer stuff. But IGAF about thumb drives sold at Walmart. What they are building gives them a seat at the table for large AI-related deals.

**Earnings TLDR:**

* Revenue: $1.7B
* Adjusted free cash flow: $220M
* Cash on hand: $1.5B
* Forecast: demand strengthening through year-end
* Gross margin took a hit (22.7%), but they’re working on it through pricing and cost controls

This was their first full quarter as a standalone company after separating from Western Digital. Still early.

**Other areas they’re moving into:**

* **EV**: Flash tech being used for autonomous driving, just nominated Ford Supplier of the Year. NOTE: I am not an EV person and haven't really gone down this rabbit hole. I'm just looking into the AI side.
* **Gaming**: Their new SSDs are winning “Best Of” awards
* **Content creation**: Rolled out pro-grade memory cards and high-performance portable SSDs

**Risks:**

* Gross margins were down this quarter—mostly due to pricing pressure and the usual NAND volatility
* Consumer segment is still soft
* Goodwill impairment made GAAP numbers ugly (-$1.8B), though this was non-cash and tied to the separation
* This is absolutely a lotto play.
* Thin options liquidity. I just got shares.

The next closest gain for an S&amp;P 500 company in that time period is a 540% pop for Vistra Corp ([VST](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VST)).Nvidia has established itself as the key provider of chips needed to operate AI systems. Now at the epicenter of an AI arms race, Nvidia has established itself as[ a cornerstone of the recent bull market](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/live/stock-market-today-tech-leads-stocks-higher-as-nvidia-surges-to-record-high-175727614.html) in stocks as the company's sales and profits have skyrocketed over the past several years.

Ahead of the [company's next quarterly earnings release on May 28](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-to-report-q1-earnings-as-middle-east-deals-export-control-reprieve-boost-stock-122728218.html), we broke down some of the most eye-popping charts that show how Nvidia became one of the most-followed stocks in the market.There's perhaps no clearer way to see how Nvidia ran away from the competition in the AI boom than looking at the company's market capitalization against its peers. Back when ChatGPT launched, Nvidia had a market cap of just over $400 billion. It's now over $3.3 trillion. Over that same time period, chip competitor Intel's ([INTC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/INTC)) market cap has actually decreased, while Advanced Micro Devices' ([AMD](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMD)) market cap has increased incrementally from $125 billion to $177 billion.Nvidia's rise proved to be at the center of a new technological boom. Combined with Nvidia, the rise in dominance of six other companies — Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)), Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL), [GOOG](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG)), Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)), Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)), Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)), and Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)) — formed what would come to be known as the [""Magnificent Seven.""](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/one-chart-shows-how-the-magnificent-7-have-dominated-the-stock-market-in-2023-203250125.html)

The group began the AI boom with a combined market cap just shy of $7 billion. Now, two and a half years later, the Big Tech group's market cap is worth over $16.8 trillion. The seven companies have grown from about 22% of the S&amp;P 500's market cap in November 2022 to 32% of the index's market cap today.Given the outsized weighting in the S&amp;P 500, large swings in shares of Nvidia have become a feature of how even broad market investors are thinking about the direction of stocks. In June 2024,[ three Wall Street strategists boosted their year-end S&amp;P 500 targets](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-enthusiasm-prompts-3-wall-street-banks-to-raise-stock-market-forecasts-100027154.html), citing better-than-expected consistent performance among key AI players.

As of May 19, the Magnificent Seven have accounted for about 52% of the S&amp;P 500's gain since Nov. 30, 2022. Nvidia alone has contributed 17.21%, by far the most among the group, with the next closest stock, Microsoft, which has added about 8.8%.Nvidia's stock hasn't been rising from just hype. The company's quarterly financial metrics have soared. In the quarter ChatGPT launched, Nvidia posted revenue of $6.3 billion. Two years later, it would post revenue of $35.3 billion. That's a 460% increase in sales in two years. As seen in the chart below, the main source of growth for Nvidia has been its data center revenue segment, which includes the sales of its AI chips.

From the company's fourth quarter of 2023 to its final quarter of its 2025 reporting period, data center revenue grew almost 900%.

Nvidia's data center revenue particularly stands out when considering its rise against peers in the industry. In the final quarter of 2024, Nvidia notched a record $35.58 billion in just data center revenue, up from $3.62 billion in the final quarter of 2022.

In comparison, Alphabet's data center revenue increased to $11.96 billion, ending 2024 up from $7.32 billion in the final quarter of 2022.

Combined with Nvidia, the rise in dominance of six other companies — Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)), Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL), [GOOG](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG)), Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)), Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)), Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)), and Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)) — formed what would come to be known as the [""Magnificent Seven.""](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/one-chart-shows-how-the-magnificent-7-have-dominated-the-stock-market-in-2023-203250125.html)

The group began the AI boom with a combined market cap just shy of $7 billion. Now, two and a half years later, the Big Tech group's market cap is worth over $16.8 trillion. The seven companies have grown from about 22% of the S&amp;P 500's market cap in November 2022 to 32% of the index's market cap today.Given the outsized weighting in the S&amp;P 500, large swings in shares of Nvidia have become a feature of how even broad market investors are thinking about the direction of stocks. In June 2024,[ three Wall Street strategists boosted their year-end S&amp;P 500 targets](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-enthusiasm-prompts-3-wall-street-banks-to-raise-stock-market-forecasts-100027154.html), citing better-than-expected consistent performance among key AI players.

As of May 19, the Magnificent Seven have accounted for about 52% of the S&amp;P 500's gain since Nov. 30, 2022. Nvidia alone has contributed 17.21%, by far the most among the group, with the next closest stock, Microsoft, which has added about 8.8%.Nvidia's stock hasn't been rising from just hype. The company's quarterly financial metrics have soared. In the quarter ChatGPT launched, Nvidia posted revenue of $6.3 billion. Two years later, it would post revenue of $35.3 billion. That's a 460% increase in sales in two years. As seen in the chart below, the main source of growth for Nvidia has been its data center revenue segment, which includes the sales of its AI chips.

From the company's fourth quarter of 2023 to its final quarter of its 2025 reporting period, data center revenue grew almost 900%.

Nvidia's data center revenue particularly stands out when considering its rise against peers in the industry. In the final quarter of 2024, Nvidia notched a record $35.58 billion in just data center revenue, up from $3.62 billion in the final quarter of 2022.

In comparison, Alphabet's data center revenue increased to $11.96 billion, ending 2024 up from $7.32 billion in the final quarter of 2022.

What Happened?

Shares of quantum computing company IonQ (NYSE:IONQ) jumped 36.3% in the afternoon session after renewed enthusiasm for quantum computing following the sharp pullback in the first quarter of the year.

While specific news for the day wasn't immediately apparent to have caused a major surge, the company has had a series of positive announcements, including strong Q1 2025 earnings that beat analyst estimates.

Earlier in the week, the company announced a collaboration with Swedish company Einride to develop quantum solutions for fleet routing, logistics optimization, and supply chain solutions. This would also extend to Einride's autonomous and electric fleet operations worldwide, two of the fast evolving tech markets, which hold a lot of opportunities and growth potential.

Adding to the optimism, the company's CEO reiterated its ambitious mission to become the 'Nvidia of quantum computing' in an interview with Barron's.

The shares closed the day at $45.88, up 36.9% from previous close.

What The Market Is Telling Us

IonQ’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 105 moves greater than 5% over the last year. But moves this big are rare even for IonQ and indicate this news significantly impacted the market’s perception of the business.

The previous big move we wrote about was about 1 month ago when the stock gained 7.9% on the news that investor sentiment improved on renewed optimism that the US-China trade conflict might be nearing a resolution. According to reports, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reinforced this positive outlook by describing the trade war as ""unsustainable,"" and emphasized that a potential agreement between the two economic powers ""was possible."" His comments signaled to markets that both sides might be motivated to seek common ground, raising expectations for reduced tariffs and more stability across markets.

IonQ is up 4.4% since the beginning of the year, but at $45.01 per share, it is still trading 11.9% below its 52-week high of $51.07 from January 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of IonQ’s shares at the IPO in January 2021 would now be looking at an investment worth $4,168.

Today’s young investors likely haven’t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy.

109,AAPL,Unpopular opinion on DWAVE(QBTS),"So here is the deal guys, I have been doing some research into D-Wave and here is what I would like to share with the entire community.

Let me start with the very basic and something everyone knows already( I hope) they are in the quantum industry, currently there are 6000+ devoting they time in some sort of quantum research, of those 6000, “only”  513 are pure-play ,  D-Wave is part of the later, so 1/513.

….Yes its a crowded space.

First lets talk about the fundamentals (in the end its all about that anyway)

Last year they made 8M of revenue and spend 75M, so they lost almost 70M in 2024. Simple maths so far right. In terms of Price/earnings (the famous P/E)  is non, zero, nada, and thats ok for a new company, specially in the early stages. Right?

Wrong they exist since 1999, yes you hear that right, 25+ years and since they started operations they were never profitable. 25 years old company. …Let that sink in.

Now some red flags are becoming clear, but hey lets calm down, 1 ratio is not enough to give the big picture, one must have a “helicopter view”.

2024 Price to Book (P/B)=35.22 For comparison the average price for a Nasdaq100 company is 4.56.  And yes the most valued companies in the world (Apple/Googles…etc) are almost 8 times cheaper than D-Wave. And they (Apple,microsoft…et al)are not the cheapest stock to own by any means.

Ok so P/E and P/B are screaming red flags, lets have a look at EV/Revenue as a better metric since it takes into consideration debt and cash on hand, and not only Market Cap.

2024 EV/Revenue is a whopping…wait for it…241 2024  D-Wave EV/Revenue=241, you guys have any idea of how hard this? Again, for comparison the average Nasdaq 100 company sits at just 6.84 Crazy right?…

But wait there more… 2024 Price to sales (P/S)=154  this basically means that for $1 they get in revenue they need to spend $154+ For comparison, the average Nasdaq100 company sits at 2.85.

Let me get this straight:  D-Wave is 75 x expensive that the most valuable companies in the world (and again, those companies are not cheap to own)

Am sorry to be repetitive, but I have to say it again: D-Wave is 75x more EXPENSIVE than the MOST VALUABLE COMPANIES in the WORLD.

U guys know how much dilution occur last year? 260M, 266,595,867 if u wanna be precise.

They are laughing at us retailers while cashing millions and providing for their families, and you guys allow that to happen by buying a laughing stock.

It’s a JOKE!!!!

Yes, revenue increased 500% in last Q, they sold a single computer for 13M and they did not disclose how long it take them to build(wondering why?). Allow me to explain why, on average it takes 3-5 years, lets be optimistic here and assume the best scenario, lets say they made it in 2 years, world record (and remember if they did that, they would be bragging on the media).

The second important question would be, how much it cost them? Well they did not disclose as always. Well, if u take again the best case scenario, and imagine that they build in the last 2 years, it cost 79.3M(2023) + 75.6M (2024) thats the amount they lost in the last 2 years, but this includes everything (COGS: Cost of Good sold, General and Administrative Expenses, R&amp;D,Selling &amp; Marketing)

By the way, you know what they spend those 155M of expenses ending 2024 and 2023? Its all salaries, 85% to be more precise.

35% its all for administration and high management salaries, 25% for the research and development team salaries 15% was just for PPE and the last 10% was on marketing.

In other words they spend more on high management than in R&amp;D. You know how CRAZYY this is?

And one more thing…

“Because of our scale, the great partnerships we have with our suppliers and productivity that we continue to drive in our business, we intend to generally maintain our current pricing levels across our portfolio,” McPhail told CNBC in an interview.

More than half of what the company sells comes from the U.S., he said.

130,AAPL,Stephen Miran's idea about tariffs is not black and white as he says...(my thoughts),"I've read the paper 2 times to really get his points across. I think the paper is a MUST READ not because there is a lot to learn from it, but because you should be prepared what the admin thinks, so get prepared.

I want to discuss one idea from the paper, even though many topics are worth discussing:

He says tariffs are usually paid by the exporting nation (companies in that nation) only if currency is offset by the same percentage as the tariff. Example:

1 - Imported good price is $10 pre trariff -&gt;

2 - Dollar value is up 10%, so that same good now costs $9 -&gt;

3 - Tariff added of 10% for that good now makes it $9.9 (we call it same price basically)

So his point is that tariffs can be offset this way, so consumer pays basically the same price but $1 goes to the treasury, thus exporting nation (company) basically paid the tariff and U.S. gets additional revenue.

I think this is kind of misleading for the reason: Mathematically what he says is true, but **burden is still shared by the consumer and the exporting nation in this case**, not only by exporting nation. Consumer is still ""robbed"" of the opportunity to buy the good for $9 and capitalize from dollar valuation, instead he pays same price and not getting any benefit from it. I understand that possibly this revenue from tariffs will bring some of the taxes down (yet to see?), but not to the point that you would be compensated and still pay $9 for the same product.

He often gives the same example in interviews (there are couple of them) where he compares a house sale. If for example tax of real estate is up by 10%, the seller also ups the value for +10% but buyer does not want to buy, the seller has to sell the house for the original price thus he burdens the cost of the tax because of inelasticity. I think this example is comparing apples to oranges because buyer does not share burden in this case, so he makes a trick that it is the same with tariffs, when in reality consumer is still ""robbed"" of opportunity in the first case, and not in this case.

Now, the next point he makes is that inelasticity makes exporting nation pay the tariff because they don't have anywhere else to sell the product. Even after exporting company squeeze maximum margin just to stay in the market, part of the cost is still shared with the consumer, because consumer would never fully capitalize from squeezing margins even if price is now lower than it previously was.

Final thought, I think it is in the spectrum of who burdens the cost by how much.

Reposting in hopes of re-sparking the discussion on this-- obviously with Trump pausing all tariffs except for China and the dip being bought, it looks like what I said would happen happened.**

**However, phase 2 is just beginning.**

DISCLAIMER: I THINK THEIR PLANS ARE 100% DISTILLED ORGANIC REGARDIUM. HOWEVER, THESE PLANS EXIST; IT ISN'T JUST THE DEATH THROES OF A DEMENTED OLD MAN. IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THEIR GOALS AND HOW THEY WANT TO ACHIEVE THEM, SO YOU DON'T GET WIPED OUT BY A SINGULAR MANIAC'S AMBITIONS.

  
“I believe very strongly in tariffs. America is being ripped off. We’re a debtor nation, and we have to tax, we have to tariff, we have to protect this country.”

\--Donald Trump, 1988



[Transshipment](https://china.ucsd.edu/_files/02072025-brief-identify-tariff-evasion-web.pdf) is how China bypasses US trade restrictions-- the idea is simple, just ship to an intermediate country in southeast Asia or Mexico before shipping to the United States. Since the entire goal is to evade detection, it's impossible to get direct numbers on how much Chinese originating volume comes into the U.S. in this manner, but it's estimated to be at the very least tens of billions of dollars in goods per year.

This has also been [top-of-mind from Trump's current administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/02/industry-lawmakers-applaud-president-trumps-section-232-tariffs/), with realizations that the 2018 trade war did not go to the extent of their real goals because of ""loopholes"" and negotiation failures. So, this time around, the goal is the same-- a trade war with China, but the entire world has become collateral damage.

Their goals behind the trade war with China hasn't drastically changed from 2018:

* [Coward Nutlick has repeatedly hinted that ""deindustrialization is a national security risk"".](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transcript-commerce-secretary-howard-lutnick-on-face-the-nation-with-margaret-brennan-april-6-2025/) In layman's terms, if a war ever broke out, [China would be able to pump out missiles and weapons at a faster pace.](https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA787225532&amp;sid=sitemap&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;p=AONE&amp;sw=w&amp;userGroupName=anon%7E3a357c28&amp;aty=open-web-entry) Peter Navarro has said that ""every time you buy a good made in China, you are financing their navy in the Taiwan strait."" His book Death by China (2011) also details how we are dependent on their supply chains for medical supplies, electronics, and weapons.
* Miran, senior economic advisor to Trump: [trade deficits are economic dependence.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/04/cea-chairman-steve-miran-hudson-institute-event-remarks/) True at face value, but the dependency goes both ways. As with the fundamental theory of trading and competitive advantage goes, both sides win. U.S. industry is built off the back of Chinese supply and labor, and the Chinese have become wealthy off of the largest consumer market in the world.

So, the plan that would somewhat explain their intentions behind tariffing the world is to get other countries to come to the table, fence-off Chinese transshipping, and/or strike deals that cut off Chinese suppliers to third party countries as well. This would explain why they imposed tariffs on penguin-inhabited islands such as [Heard and McDonald Island](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/apr/04/revealed-how-trump-tariffs-slugged-norfolk-island-and-uninhabited-heard-and-mcdonald-islands)\-- closing off loopholes. They want to hurt China while hurting ourselves, but think that we can withstand the pain more than they can. It's unclear as to whether they're right, or if this game is even worth playing, but it's definitely *a plan, even if it's a bad one,* which is better for the market than having no narrative or confidence.

What does this mean in the short term? Trump has no intention to keep unjustifiably high tariffs on everyone else *besides China.* As deals are struck, either side capitulates, it becomes clear that ""liberation day"" was just a second attempt at 2018 U.S. vs. China, which, to investors, is at least preferable to U.S. vs. The World (for seemingly no reason). With a narrative to cling onto and a return to (relative) normalcy, the markets can go up in the short term because of a universal instinct to ""buy the dip."" The markets no longer have reason to freefall panic that a literal maniac is driving the world economy to ruin; he at least has a plan, if not a half-baked one.

**\^ this was posted on 2025-04-08 2:12PM ET.**

**""TRUMP HAS NO INTENTION TO KEEP UNJUSTIFIABLY HIGH TARIFFS ON EVERYONE ELSE BESIDES CHINA"" --me**

**""THE MARKETS CAN GO UP IN THE SHORT TERM BECAUSE OF A UNIVERSAL INSTINCT TO BUY THE DIP"" --me**

**""TO INVESTORS, U.S. VS. CHINA IS PREFERABLE TO U.S. VS. THE WORLD"" --me**

However, as the initial panic subsides, the ramifications of ""reducing the trade deficit with China"" will set in. Numbers like earnings, inflation, consumer spending, and GDP growth will bleed. Eventually unemployment, defaults, and bankruptcies will follow, putting the Fed in an unwinnable situation. The private sector won't want to build US factories, find alternative trading partners (who will take the opportunity to increase prices), and ""reindustrialize"" because the Republicans could simply lose in a few years, and the policy is reversed. Imagine spending billions in U.S., factories paying 5x in wages, only for these cheap overseas pathways to open up again. There needs to be private sector *confidence* that these policies are set in stone, which is why Trump has continually attempted to affirm that they are. But they aren't. Cost-push inflation is going to rile the peasants in the U.S. once again to chop off the heads of the incumbents, and Republicans are projected to lose bigly in 2026 and 2028.

tl;dr: Since the goal is to ""Reduce the trade deficit with China,"" this will directly eat into profit margins of U.S. companies and the spending power of the working class, at a failed attempt to reindustrialize America. China may be hurt as well; but in this future, it may be at a cost of a popping AI bubble and a new U.S. depression.

**UPDATE AFTER TRUMP HAS PAUSED ALL TARIFFS EXCEPT FOR CHINA**

I think this is a bit of corroboration to my original theory that global tariffs was an attempt to strong-arm the rest of the world into U.S.'s side against China. If you were to get my opinion on whether this was the most intelligent or reasonable way to do it, I obviously have an endless amount of things to say. But my opinion doesn't matter; this post is simply trying to discern their ambitions, and how they will try to achieve them. Understanding the incentives behind this chaos is of supreme importance to best navigate it.

Who are these people that Trump has surrounded himself with? Navarro, Miran, Lighthizer, Kudlow, Barr, Bannon, Mnuchin, Rubio, Waltz, Helberg, Bolton, Pottinger, Wray...

Navarro refused to comply with a Jan. 6 subpoena, in 2023 was sentenced to 4 months in prison. He also promoted Lab Leak conspiracies and has had a long history of questionable policy advocacy, solely focused on how China is ""ripping off the world."" Trump's rhetoric on China, trade deficits, and tariffs is almost ripped straight from Navarro's various books. Lighthizer and Miran have long advocated for using high tariffs as a coercive weapon, and have had histories of downplaying the effects of retaliation on domestic industries. Some of these anti-China allies are truly focused on national security with legitimate concerns over IP theft and Chinese rapid militarization.

Are these people the originators of Trump's ideology, or did Trump select the fringe, controversial figures in economics and defense that corroborated with his worldview? It's unclear, but no matter how this unified political stance came to be, the conclusion is simple:

**Trump's administration believes that national security vs. China is the critical goal that potentially supercedes the Stock Market, domestic industrial stability, inflation, and the buying power of the average American. They are willing to destroy access to Chinese supply chains to force America to ""decouple"" with China.** **They don't care about Apple, Tesla, the S&amp;P 500, etc; for one, Trump thinks that the Fed will eventually do ZIRP and infinite QE to pump the stocks once more, and that slashing 50% off of Apple is worth it as long as they find other suppliers or build domestic supply chains.**

**He believes in ""short term pain,"" however, in a year or a few years, U.S. capital dominance will survive, after purging the ""dependency"" on China.**

Simply put:

AAPL, TSLA, WMT, NKE, BBY, QCOM, INTC 2026 PUTS.

However, in the short term, stocks will continue to pump as the ""apocalypse cancelled; buy the dip"" reflex continues over the rest of the week.

*TLDR : LONG the Apparel/Footwear sector. Particularly: Vans, Nike, Adidas, Puma, Lululemon, Calvin Klein, Crocs, Decker you name it.*

Few points on why I'm extremely bullish on the apparel sector as of today:

1. On talks of the reshoring of jobs, SWEATSHOPS are the last thing they would want. Someone correct me if I missed it, but I haven't heard anyone from the White House talk about bringing back the textile industry. It’s all semiconductors, autos, steel—high-tech or heavy industry. Apparel/footwear likely will end up getting a very light tariff or even a pass after Vietnam bends the knee and buy BOEING jets and treasuries.
2. Bessent’s already hinted these tariffs are the ceiling, not the floor—negotiations will bring them down. **Vietnam's Deputy Prime Minister is scheduled to talk to Bessent today**. And later-on executives from Boeing/Apple etc. Apparel/footwear’s taken a HUGE hit because Vietnam’s because these companies spent CAPEX to build manufacturing there to dodge those China tariffs. This broad based 40% tariff will end up causing US companies to pay their share.
3. On inventories, Levi’s CEO said two days ago guided next quarter’s gross margin steady. Why? Summer inventory’s are currently already in the US. **Most apparel companies have a 2-4 month lead-time before they have to reorder from Vietnam, Cambodia, or Bangladesh**. If negotiations wrap up in the coming 3-4 weeks, it’s back to business—no disruption.
4. Bond Yields Screwed the Macros. US 10-Year jumped from 3.9% to 4.4% in two days—probably smoked a few macro funds. Trump has repeatedly talked about lowing the 10Y and China retaliating isn't helping. The expedites the negotiations, it has to happen NOW or someone has to fold soon --- either the FED, US, China or the economy.
5. And the cherry on top of all is the tariffs spooked consumers into panic buying. Next quarter’s YoY numbers will look juicy. All predicated that Vietnam bend's the knee, which I bet they will for most things.

There's other things like 2026 Nov Mid-terms election (which Trump wants to declare massive victory), and massive tax-cuts and deregulation to be bullish about, but i'll leave it for another day when it comes.

Downside:  
A natural calamity totally wipes humanity out, and we return back to the ocean, reuniting with nature. At least you could claim you had the balls to buy the DIP.

This broad based 40% tariff will end up causing US companies to pay their share.
3. On inventories, Levi’s CEO said two days ago guided next quarter’s gross margin steady. Why? Summer inventory’s are currently already in the US. **Most apparel companies have a 2-4 month lead-time before they have to reorder from Vietnam, Cambodia, or Bangladesh**. If negotiations wrap up in the coming 3-4 weeks, it’s back to business—no disruption.
4. Bond Yields Screwed the Macros. US 10-Year jumped from 3.9% to 4.4% in two days—probably smoked a few macro funds. Trump has repeatedly talked about lowing the 10Y and China retaliating isn't helping. The expedites the negotiations, it has to happen NOW or someone has to fold soon --- either the FED, US, China or the economy.
5. And the cherry on top of all is the tariffs spooked consumers into panic buying. Next quarter’s YoY numbers will look juicy. All predicated that Vietnam bend's the knee, which I bet they will for most things.

There's other things like 2026 Nov Mid-terms election (which Trump wants to declare massive victory), and massive tax-cuts and deregulation to be bullish about, but i'll leave it for another day when it comes.

Downside:  
A natural calamity totally wipes humanity out, and we return back to the ocean, reuniting with nature. At least you could claim you had the balls to buy the DIP.

I didn't get to post my DD with my YOLO because I failed a ban bet. Also I forgot to put it in the post.

Last week’s gold event: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdFjAhDP3sM&amp;ab\_channel=Robinhood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdFjAhDP3sM&amp;ab_channel=Robinhood)

TLDR: IMO Robinhood is the best stock on the market right now with a great business model and the best team and has the most upside potential, even during a market downturn.

They had 1.5 million gold subscribers at $5/month last year. Now MORE THAN DOUBLED TO 3.2 MILLION.

Robinhood has the potential to become the next trillion-dollar company. Everyone is always looking for the next stock that will have NVDA or TSLA-like growth and I have good reason to believe that Robinhood is the one. Literally a 30-bagger since they’re at $37 billion, which is NOTHING. For example, about $1 trillion flew out of Nvidia in like a month and Robinhood only needs around $55 billion more to reach $100/share. They actually have a good business model leading the great leap forward in transforming finance with a CEO that is already mainstream. Man is on CNBC last week: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpoKCzJVrU0&amp;ab\_channel=CNBCTelevision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpoKCzJVrU0&amp;ab_channel=CNBCTelevision)

They are going to smash earnings again IMO. Been taking money hand over fist. They already smashed earnings last quarter.

I’d say that inclusion into the S&amp;P 500 is on the horizon. They just missed it last quarter but I see no reason why they can’t be in this quarter with a lot of stocks tanking. And we all know what happened when TSLA was put into the S&amp;P 500 with a similarly well-known CEO known as the Elongated Muskrat. ROCKET EMOJI.

Robinhood is overhauling everything with their services, including the use of AI. That’s right. The AI buzzword. They cap their fees at $250/year for investment advisor systems.

Cash delivery? Bruh I’m never going to an ATM again: [https://robinhood.com/us/en/banking/](https://robinhood.com/us/en/banking/)

They have 12 partner banks so FDIC insurance is $2.5 million with them instead of $250,000: [https://robinhood.com/us/en/gold/](https://robinhood.com/us/en/gold/)

Robinhood is now VENMO/Apple Pay. You can send money to people instantly: [https://robinhood.com/us/en/banking/](https://robinhood.com/us/en/banking/)

Robinhood makes money on everything. Options, crypto, and now even straight-up gambling with prediction markets. Even in a terrible market they still make money on fees and subscriptions.

I don't really care about any litigation involving prediction markets and I don't think anyone else does either. Gambling always wins.

IRA contribution and 401k transfer match is literally a money magnet.

People will live their entire financial lives through Robinhood. They have high-yield interest rates on uninvested cash and have a debit card. Kind of like how people use WeChat for everything.

They also have a credit card with 3% cash back on EVERYTHING (best on the market from what I’ve seen) = more money.

Great Wealth Transfer putting trillions of dollars in Millennials and Gen Z hands, going straight to RH for gambling, and especially on this sub.

Robinhood is honestly like a 7x leveraged SPY imo. Every time SPY is up 1% Robinhood is up 7%, and vice versa with the same chart pattern. SPY really only needs to go to 570 for HOOD to go to $50 from $42. $50 by the end of the week bc we will get the clarity from the big dude tomorrow.

Easy to use platform.

I am also predicting we have a face-ripping rally on liberation day because no one gives a fuck about tariffs. This is all about selling the rumor and buying the news so we all have certainty. JPOW also speaks Friday so my boy is going to pump it up.

148,AAPL,Apple is reportedly losing $1 billion a year on its streaming service as churn levels increase,"Apple's (AAPL) streaming platform is losing a reported $1 billion a year as the company faces stiff competition and a more choosy consumer.

According to a report in the Information, Apple — which just shed around $700 billion as a result of Wall Street's latest tech rout — has consistently spent over $5 billion annually to beef up its content slate since launching in 2019. That number, though, dramatically decreased to just about $500 million last year, the report said.

Apple did not immediately respond to Yahoo Finance's request for comment.

The update comes as many media giants have pulled back on spending in favor of profitability. More streaming platforms are cracking down on password sharers and have also bundled their respective offerings to prevent churn, or users abandoning their subscription plans.

Last year, Apple partnered with Netflix (NFLX) and Comcast's Peacock (CMCSA) to launch a new bundle dubbed StreamSaver, exclusively available to Comcast broadband internet service customers for a cost of $15 a month. The monthly price of a solo Apple TV+ subscription currently sits at $9.99, although users can bundle Apple's streaming service with other Apple-related products like Apple Arcade and Apple News+.

It's unclear whether the recent bundles are helping.

According to data compiled by subscription analytics platform Antenna, Apple's streaming service had the highest churn percentage of all the major streaming platforms, with the exclusion of Starz, with 7% of users churning out of the service during the month of February, compared to just 2% of users for Netflix and 4% of users for Disney+.

Notably, Apple has adopted a strategy different from that of its competitors. For one, its content slate is more limited, although it does boast highly acclaimed titles, including award-winning series like ""Severance,"" ""Shrinking,"" and ""Ted Lasso."" It was also the first streaming platform to take home an Oscar win for best picture (thanks to ""Coda"").

In total, Apple TV+ productions have earned more than 2,500 nominations and 538 wins, CEO Tim Cook said on the company's January earnings call.

Apple TV+ does not release subscriber figures, although analysts have pegged total users at anywhere from 30 million to 40 million. Compared to Netflix, which boasts over 300 million subscribers thanks to its substantial global presence, Apple TV+ does not have high penetration in emerging markets, which have become increasingly important drivers as streaming hits peak saturation levels in the US and Canada.

""Apple's streaming service never set out to be No. 1,"" Santosh Rao, head of research at Manhattan Venture Partners, previously told Yahoo Finance. ""Apple is good at the game that they play, but it's not a mass appeal game. They want to be the creative storytellers. They're more focused.""

In January, Apple reported first quarter earnings that showed all-time highs for services revenue, which includes sales from businesses like Apple TV+, along with the App Store and Apple Music. Revenue for the division climbed to $26.34 billion for the period, compared to $23.12 billion in the prior year.",1323,218,1742494342.0,2025-03-20T18:12:22+00:00,t3_1jfvft3,"Apple is reportedly losing $1 billion a year on its streaming service as churn levels increase Apple's (AAPL) streaming platform is losing a reported $1 billion a year as the company faces stiff competition and a more choosy consumer.

""Apple's streaming service never set out to be No. 1,"" Santosh Rao, head of research at Manhattan Venture Partners, previously told Yahoo Finance. ""Apple is good at the game that they play, but it's not a mass appeal game. They want to be the creative storytellers. They're more focused.""

In January, Apple reported first quarter earnings that showed all-time highs for services revenue, which includes sales from businesses like Apple TV+, along with the App Store and Apple Music. Revenue for the division climbed to $26.34 billion for the period, compared to $23.12 billion in the prior year.",0.06515736132860184,0.8732711672782898,0.061571501195430756,negative,0.8732711672782898,-0.808113805949688

151,AAPL,AI trade simply out of juice or starting to deflate?,"The S&amp;P 500 has had a stellar run for the past couple of years, adding roughly $19T from the ChatGPT moment (Nov '22) to the DeepSeek event (Jan '25). I ran some back of the envelope calculations and, by my estimate, at least half of that is AI-driven!

By AI-driven, I’m referring to two key contributors:

1. First, the ""picks and shovels"" plays in AI data centers, which contributed $4.5 trillion (24% of the S&amp;P's gains), with NVDA leading the charge, accounting for 69% (nice) of this group's gains. While in my table I’ve focused on some of the major players in this space, it's likely I've left out many others, meaning these figures almost certainly underestimate the full impact.
2. Second, the rest of the Magnificent 7, which have benefited in various ways from the AI narrative, added an additional $5.2 trillion (27% of the S&amp;P's gains).

Now, the big question is: Is the AI trade simply losing some juice, or are we witnessing the start of a full-blown reversal? Since the DeepSeek event, these names have collectively shed $1.3 trillion, suggesting the latter might not be easily dismissed.

What does this mean for the S&amp;P going forward? The rest of the pack will have to pick up the slack if we are to see some gains this year, and that is without even considering the big R word.

Edit: figured out how to add the image.

156,AAPL,HIDDEN BEHEMOTH V2: NIO,"Hey guys!

Back at it with another DD.  Going to keep it short as many can’t read complete sentences.  Nailed the last few DDs so hopefully I am right again this time.   I only post when I see a big opportunity.

The stock in play is **NIO**, the Chinese Premium EV Brand.  Yes I know, some of you are already thinking, Chinese stocks no thanks but hear me out.     To start, I moved to China for work and own a NIO ES7 and I am a firm believer. 

**Pros:**  

\-          New addressable markets with two new brands.  FIREFLY (low end consumer), On V0 (middle class consumer)  

\-          ON V0 is a game changer because the current model L60 and future models are priced for the mass market.   \*\*They even have access to NIO’s battery swapping stations!!!\*\*  This is huge because right now there is no brand that currently offers battery swapping.   

\-          Battery Swapping technology is what differentiate NIO from their competitors because it takes 5 minutes to change a battery and you are on your way.   They just completed 1 million swaps during the two weeks from Chinese New Year.  The reason why Tesla abandoned the tech is because infrastructure isn’t there/too expensive, but I can tell you it works and it works flawlessly.

\-          Owns/operate the most battery charging stations in China and along highways, the Shanghai charging/swapping operations are about to turn profitable.   Many EV companies use their charging stations as well.

\-          Priced cheaply compared to all other EV Brands, yes because they are not selling as much but be greedy when others are fearful

\-          US politics is a mess right now and in the near future, with DOGE and Trump creating a lot of uncertainties, I believe funds will move back to China as China is very proactive in getting investments back and is actually publicly protecting/enhancing their tech industry instead of beating them down like few yrs ago(check out Chinese equities)

\-          Their CEO mentioned that NIO is seeking to achieve profitability in the last quarter of 2025!!

\-          They will never go bankrupt as it is backed by the government, Tencent, Abu-Dhabi’s CYVN Holdings , so there is essentially zero risk of bankruptcy

**Cons:**

\-          Low sales numbers relative to all other brands but I firmly believe this will change as more people recognize the utility of battery swaps

\-          Lots of competition in Chinese EV market, but if they break through the mass market, there will be a huge upside

\-          They still have very low sales outside China, so it is less vulnerable to tariff compared to other manufacturers, although they are expanding in Europe and have plans for Middle East.

\-          Hemorrhaging cash but they aim to be profitable year end

 

Everything is coming together for this company.   While other Chinese EV stocks went up a lot already like Xpeng and LI.   They are just amazing cars, period.  Don’t look at outdated review from youtube comparing apples to oranges.  They are great cars.  I firmly because the risk/reward for this is amazing.   Losing 30% of your investment for have a potential for few baggers sounds absolutely amazing to me.   It is absolutely no brainer, just look at my last DD for Palantir, I am still holding it and at a 8 bagger as of today.   I put my money where my mouth is.  No options for me because of the high volatility right now.   

Position is 260,000 shares @ 4.63

Sorry for the long post. Good luck everyone!!

158,AAPL,This sector you've never touched is a 10-bagger. [DD],"I want to focus a sector that receives no love: Mining.

Trading at decade-lows with little investor interest, mining stocks today are like tech stocks in 2001. I'm going to show you how they have all the elements of a 10-bagger play, and how you should take advantage of the upcoming bull run

**PART 1: Qualities of a 10-Bagger**

Without overcomplicating things, a 10-bagger stock or industry can be summarized with these elements:

1. Left For Dead Prices - Prices that don't reflect the baked in value or potential growth of the company, especially compared to historic averages, since prices are typically mean-reverting.
2. Little Investor Participation - Trades that aren't crowded out by investors, muting potential future gains.
3. Ridiculous Potential - Massive margins of safety and explosive potential upside that lead to companies consistently growing their top line.

**PART 2: A Tale of Two Sectors**

https://preview.redd.it/a5aslgqpajje1.jpg?width=1341&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5045ac70d14bd4b629332bac9984ad0c845b1829

You've been a regard for investing in mining over the past \~30 years. The index rose over \~5x, and you're flat. Any active manager in Mining stocks has either been fired or full-ported into Apple at this point.

It's even more stark when you compare to tech. Over the past 30 years, the tech sector delivered \~5,000% return, dwarfing the broader market’s \~1,874%.

Investors have crowded the trade, leading to a situation where you nearly can't avoid exposure to the richly valued tech names:

https://preview.redd.it/47riv3obbjje1.jpg?width=1389&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e31b8099d02c792cbb737a2f9ee17374f99ef163

Safe to say miners aren't included in any meaningful allocation in today's indexes.

But do they have the potential to 10x from here?

**PART 3: Left for Dead Prices**

The most compelling case for a 10-bagger is being cheap. Buying Apple at 10-15 PE in the 2010's is retrospectively a no-brainer. It gives you an incredible margin of safety if you're buying growth for value prices.

Miners are cyclical companies deeply exposed to the price of the ores they mine. Whether it's copper, silver, gold, or rare metals, miners generally scale with the price of their underlying commodity.

https://preview.redd.it/670ubnytljje1.png?width=969&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=685e17313d2d2d33bed2d39c3733183eced31cba

For gold miners, this hasn't been the case. Despite gold roaring to highs around $2900 an ounce, the average gold miner is down over the past 20 years.

Many of these miners produce gold for less then $1000 an ounce and have been reinvesting their income into future production. Let's take a look under the hood at B2Gold $BTG

|B2Gold|Metrics|
|:-|:-|
|Total Assets|4,788,737K|
|Total Liabilities|1,599,657K|
|Book Value|\~3.2B|
|Market Cap|3.3B|
|TTM Operating Income|600Mln|
|5yr Avg Operating Income|672Mln|
|P/B|\~1X|
|P/OI|\~5X|

Wow. You're getting the company at book value today, and at a 20% income yield. It seems like it's deep value, so what are the growth prospects?

|B2Gold Company Expectations|Gold Ounces|
|:-|:-|
|2024|800K|
|2025|1Mln|
|2026|1.2Mln|

So what does this look like as far as their sales expectations? Let's see the price of gold:

Compared to the company's reported all-in-sustaining-cost of producing gold at $1,200 an ounce, the company generates about \~$1700 an ounce in cash at today's prices. Who said you needed to be a tech stock to get 50%+ margins?

So, let's take a look at their 2026 projected gold ounces produced vs. some potential prices of gold. Assuming 1.2Mln ounces produced in 2026, here is their operating income:

|Cost of Production / Gold Price|$2000|$2500|$3000|$4000|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|$1200\*|$960Mln|$1560Mln|$2160Mln|**$3360Mln**|
|$1400|$720Mln|$1320Mln|$1920Mln|$3120Mln|
|$1600|**$480Mln**|$1080Mln|$1680Mln|$2880Mln|

The company reports an AISC of $1200, but I've extrapolated this to 1,400 and 1,600 to account for worst case scenarios. Today's gold price is near $3000, but I've shown more bearish moves to $2000 an ounce to show worst case scenarios.

If you price in a 30% increase in costs and a 30% decline in gold price, the company is still trading at only **\~6X** their projected operating income.

So, an incredible margin of safety in the bear case scenario. What about a bull case scenario where costs remain the same but gold increases another 30% from here in 2026? The company will earn **3.3B** in operating income, which is the entire market capitalization. **You are potentially buying this company for 1 Forward P/E.**

The vast majority of junior gold miners have very similar fundamentals and future growth prospects. The entire industry is priced as if gold is falling +50% from here.

Similar miners are in the same boat. You don't have to look at gold. Let's take mega miner BHP Group $BHP for a ride. You're getting the company today for 5X 5 year average operating income as well, at 2X book value. Of course upside is more limited with a larger company, but the mineral diversification in BHP means that you benefit from price increases over many minerals.

**PART 4: Little Investor Participation**

Tell me this, when's the last time you saw someone shilling mining stocks on WSB? When's the last time a mining stock IPO'd on robinhood, or your friend showed you his mining tendies? There's basically zero investor interest left in the sector. It's tarnished by ESG, political risk, and just not being ""sexy"".

If you were an active manager following mining over the past 20 years, you lost your job. Why would anyone keep the regard that failed to beat the market for 20+ years?

https://preview.redd.it/2hl2u5drpjje1.png?width=1040&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=859518764be92fb4e04cfe5721935682f6d11d2b

The mining index has plummeted in comparison to its historic market participation. The pessimism is a clear setup for a multi-bagger contrarian play.

**PART 5: Ridiculous Potential**

I've already outlined an example miner for you to see the kinds of valuations present in the sector, but  the Junior Miner Index ($GDXJ) is filled to the brim with similar companies. When you look at a mining  industry's 20 year history on google, the chart looks like shit. But have they ever outperformed?

Mining stocks have generally been counter-cyclical: When markets fizzle out, they find their time to boom.

They surged in the Depression, mooned in the 70s inflation crisis:

Specifically, they are counter-cyclical with Tech, and boomed during the last tech cycle wash in 2000:

And of course, the prices of the ores they're pulling out of the ground are expected to rise as well. Inflation is ripping the price of gold and looks to stop no time soon.

Steel and iron used for building is ramping up with urbanization and economic prosperity, whereas rare earth metals are finding their space in batteries, EVs, and semiconductors.

Copper is the backbone of electrification, and every single year the world breaks the previous year's record for humans living in urban environments. Global prosperity is the true secular bull market, and metals &amp; mining are deeply connected to global growth in general.

Nearly all metals are also hedged to the growth of emerging markets, giving any US investors some necessary global exposure.

**PART 6: How to Play It**

Here's my takes on the best opportunities in mining:

|Opportunity|Sector|Justification|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Higher Opportunity|Individual small-cap miners ($BTG) \[Gold, Coal, Iron, Copper, ETC\]|Diving into individual names helps you avoid exposure to low quality companies in the indexes. Small caps have the best potential to scale earnings parabolically.|
||Junior Miner Index ($GDXJ)|General exposure to smallcap gold|
||Individual large-cap miners ($BHP)|While not as sensitive to price movements to the upside, large-caps are less sensitive to downside movements in the underlying commodities, and you can avoid some junk by diving into individual names|
||Metals &amp; Mining ETFs ($PICK, $COPX)|Exposure beyond gold is great, as many of these miners across different metals have similar valuations and vary in their industry verticals.|
||Gold Miner ETF ($GDX)|General exposure to largecap gold|
|Lower Opportunity|Rare Earth Metals ($REMX)|While I think the same thesis is in tact for rare earth metal miners, their valuations trade at a substantial premium to the more ""classical"" miners of gold, silver, coal, iron, copper, nickel etc.|

My plays:

I'm long the following:

Reposting with positions.",3201,847,1739734817.0,2025-02-16T19:40:17+00:00,t3_1ir0k5o,"This sector you've never touched is a 10-bagger. [DD] I want to focus a sector that receives no love: Mining.

Trading at decade-lows with little investor interest, mining stocks today are like tech stocks in 2001. I'm going to show you how they have all the elements of a 10-bagger play, and how you should take advantage of the upcoming bull run

**PART 1: Qualities of a 10-Bagger**

Without overcomplicating things, a 10-bagger stock or industry can be summarized with these elements:

1. Left For Dead Prices - Prices that don't reflect the baked in value or potential growth of the company, especially compared to historic averages, since prices are typically mean-reverting.
2. Little Investor Participation - Trades that aren't crowded out by investors, muting potential future gains.
3. Ridiculous Potential - Massive margins of safety and explosive potential upside that lead to companies consistently growing their top line.

**PART 2: A Tale of Two Sectors**

https://preview.redd.it/a5aslgqpajje1.jpg?width=1341&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5045ac70d14bd4b629332bac9984ad0c845b1829

You've been a regard for investing in mining over the past \~30 years. The index rose over \~5x, and you're flat. Any active manager in Mining stocks has either been fired or full-ported into Apple at this point.

It's even more stark when you compare to tech. Over the past 30 years, the tech sector delivered \~5,000% return, dwarfing the broader market’s \~1,874%.

Investors have crowded the trade, leading to a situation where you nearly can't avoid exposure to the richly valued tech names:

https://preview.redd.it/47riv3obbjje1.jpg?width=1389&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e31b8099d02c792cbb737a2f9ee17374f99ef163

Safe to say miners aren't included in any meaningful allocation in today's indexes.

But do they have the potential to 10x from here?

**PART 3: Left for Dead Prices**

The most compelling case for a 10-bagger is being cheap. Buying Apple at 10-15 PE in the 2010's is retrospectively a no-brainer. It gives you an incredible margin of safety if you're buying growth for value prices.

Miners are cyclical companies deeply exposed to the price of the ores they mine. Whether it's copper, silver, gold, or rare metals, miners generally scale with the price of their underlying commodity.

https://preview.redd.it/670ubnytljje1.png?width=969&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=685e17313d2d2d33bed2d39c3733183eced31cba

For gold miners, this hasn't been the case. Despite gold roaring to highs around $2900 an ounce, the average gold miner is down over the past 20 years.

Many of these miners produce gold for less then $1000 an ounce and have been reinvesting their income into future production. Let's take a look under the hood at B2Gold $BTG

|B2Gold|Metrics|
|:-|:-|
|Total Assets|4,788,737K|
|Total Liabilities|1,599,657K|
|Book Value|\~3.2B|
|Market Cap|3.3B|
|TTM Operating Income|600Mln|
|5yr Avg Operating Income|672Mln|
|P/B|\~1X|
|P/OI|\~5X|

Wow. You're getting the company at book value today, and at a 20% income yield. It seems like it's deep value, so what are the growth prospects?

|B2Gold Company Expectations|Gold Ounces|
|:-|:-|
|2024|800K|
|2025|1Mln|
|2026|1.2Mln|

So what does this look like as far as their sales expectations? Let's see the price of gold:

https://preview.redd.it/00gmixjgnjje1.png?width=1083&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f2b3030a72eb4b41b4938d400eeac334db5b28fa

|$1600|**$480Mln**|$1080Mln|$1680Mln|$2880Mln|

167,AAPL,You all are overlooking a giant opportunity—Google!,"In the fiscal year 2024 Google’s net profit was more than Apple. Google‘s revenue grew double digit while Apple was below 5%. It is the only AI company that is vertically integrated - from chips to compute to distribution. If TikTok didn’t get banned, there is no chance in hell that US is breaking Google’s Monopoly. 

It behaves like a mature company. The stock isn’t as volatile as Meta. The CEO doesn’t abruptly change plans and plunge billions of dollars into random personal projects.


It is the only company that has self driving cabs running for probably almost 2 years now in multiple cities without any major issue . And let me be clear there is no second option till date. Every other company is just training or experimenting. A big assumption is that Elmo will change regulation to benefit from it for their Robo taxi operation, but the regulation isn’t what is stopping Tesla from becoming a robot taxi company they haven’t proven their tech yet. 

Yes, AI might be something that could be disrupting or changing a lot of Google’s original business. But it’s not like their AI is completely shitty. It’s still amongst the top and they have an ecosystem which can easily leverage this. I suspect Apple losing out on the market because of Apple Intelligence being subpar. Google will end up creating a personal AI because of the amount of personal data it has from all of us. No other company can do that because they just don’t have access to all of this. 

Googles search business was still growing at 10% per year. Even if the number of searches go down because people start using AI, we haven’t seen any meaningful difference in Google usage so in the worst case, I would just assume that this business isn’t growing for my calculation. But its AI would still accelerate Google cloud and YouTube. And the advertisers are not really going to AI company because they haven’t figured out their business yet and for the time being it’s going to be like a subscription based business.

175,AAPL,Nvidia’s $590 Billion DeepSeek Rout Is Largest in Market History,"ALTERNATIVE SOURCE — Bloomberg: Nvidia Corp.’s plunge, fueled by investor concern about Chinese artificial-intelligence startup DeepSeek, erased a record amount of stock-market value from the world’s largest company. 

Nvidia shares tumbled 17% Monday, the biggest drop since March 2020, erasing $589 billion from the company’s market capitalization. That eclipsed the previous record — a 9% drop in September that wiped out about $279 billion in value — and was the biggest in US stock-market history. 

The drop rippled through the rest of the market due to how much weight Nvidia has in major indexes. Including Monday’s slump, Nvidia selloffs have caused eight of the top ten biggest one-day drops in the S&amp;P 500 Index, based on market value, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The S&amp;P 500 fell 1.5% Monday and the Nasdaq 100 tumbled nearly 3%.

The semiconductor maker led a broader selloff in technology stocks after DeepSeek’s low-cost approach reignited concerns that big US companies have poured too much money into developing artificial intelligence. The Chinese firm appears to provide a comparable performance at a fraction of the price. 

The latest AI model of DeepSeek, released last week, is widely seen as competitive with those of OpenAI and Meta Platforms Inc. The open-sourced product was founded by quant-fund chief Liang Wenfeng and is now at the top of Apple Inc.’s App Store rankings. 

“Concerns have immediately emerged that it could be a disruptor to the current AI business model, which relies on high end chips and extensive computing power and hence energy,” Jefferies analysts said in a note to clients.

Nvidia has been the biggest beneficiary of the influx in spending on AI because they design semiconductors used in the technology. While that heavy spending looks poised to continue, investors may grow wary of rewarding companies that aren’t showing a sufficient return on the investment. 

Meta announced plans on Friday to boost capital expenditures on AI projects this year by about half to as much as $65 billion, sending its shares to a record high. That came on the heels of OpenAI, SoftBank Group Corp. and Oracle Corp. announcing a $100 billion joint venture called Stargate to build out data centers and AI infrastructure projects around the US. 

In a bid to stall China’s progress in AI, the US has banned the export of advanced semiconductor technologies to the country and is limiting sales of advanced Nvidia AI chips to others. But DeepSeek’s progress suggests Chinese AI engineers have found a way to work around the export bans, focusing on greater efficiency with limited resources.

Nvidia said in a statement Monday that DeepSeek’s model is an “excellent AI advancement” and indicated that the Chinese company didn’t violate US restrictions that limit access to advanced US chips in creating its technology. It also added that inference, or the work of running AI models, requires “requires significant numbers of Nvidia GPUs and high-performance networking.”

**THE NUCLEAR BOMB TRUMP JUST DROPPED 💣 Yesterday, Trump signed the most aggressive energy executive order I've ever seen. This isn't your regular ""save the polar bears"" BS. This is the federal government going full send on California regulators.**

Just when you thought this setup couldn't get any more interesting, **Phil fucking Mickelson** is in the stock too.

\--

Listen up degenerates, because I've found something so beautiful it would make Michael Burry cry. This isn't your regular oil moonshot - this is the kind of deep value play that usually gets snatched up by Private Equity before retail ever sees it.

First, let me explain what the fuck SOC even is, because this backstory is important. Back in 2021, a group of oil industry veterans pulled off what might be the biggest chad move in energy: they bought ExxonMobil's shutdown California oil fields for pocket change. Not some speculative drilling rights - we're talking about three massive offshore platforms that were pumping 671 MILLION barrels of oil from 1981 to 2015.

Why did these money printers stop? In 2015, one of their pipelines had an oopsie that made California regulators lose their minds. Everything got shut down, and Exxon, tired of dealing with California's bs, basically said ""fuck it"" and sold the whole thing to these guys who became Sable Offshore. They gave them a loan, and said here you go.

Here's where it gets interesting. The deal was structured like a 4D chess move: Sable got the assets for almost nothing upfront, BUT they have to restart production by January 2026 or Exxon can take everything back. Everyone thought they were fucked because California's regulatory process moves slower than your wife's boyfriend on date night.

But yesterday, something magical happened. **Trump signed an executive order** that's basically a tactical nuke aimed directly at California regulators. And this isn't your regular executive order about protecting endangered snails - this is the federal government going full ""fuck your permits"" mode.

**Let me explain why this order changes everything. When Trump declared a national energy emergency yesterday, he didn't just sign some weak 'pretty please approve permits faster' bullshit. He activated three specific legal powers that turn SOC from 'maybe someday' to 'holy shit this is happening':**

1. **The Defense Production Act** \- If you don't know what this is, it's the same law they used to force companies to make ventilators during COVID. Except now, instead of ventilators, they're saying SOC's oil is critical to national defense. Think about that. Once your oil field becomes a military strategic asset, California's permits become as relevant as your wife's boyfriend's opinion on your investment strategy.
2. **Federal Preemption Powers** \- The order specifically calls out California's ""dangerous State and local policies"" as a threat to national security. This isn't just fancy legal talk. Remember the Millennium Pipeline case in 2006? New York tried to block a natural gas pipeline, and the feds just said ""nah"" and built it anyway. This order gives SOC the same power, but on steroids because now it's a declared national emergency.
3. **Military Construction Authority** \- This is the cherry on top. The order lets the Department of Defense declare infrastructure as critical to national security. Once that happens, SOC's pipelines aren't oil pipelines anymore - they're strategic defense assets. Game over.

But here's where it gets really spicy. While the market is still trying to figure out what this means, the CEO, Jim Flores, already showed us he knows exactly what's coming. In October, this absolute chad traded his private jet - yes, his PRIVATE JET - for 600,000 more shares. When's the last time you saw a CEO give up his jet to buy more stock? This isn't some bullshit insider buying where they grab a few shares for show. This is ""I believe in this so much I'll fly Spirit Airlines"" level conviction.

**Now let's talk numbers, because this is where your smooth brain might actually form a wrinkle. SOC is currently trading at $26, which values their oil at $4.87 per barrel. Meanwhile, every other comparable company trades at $26 per barrel. For you math-challenged apes, that means SOC is trading at ONE-FIFTH of what it should be worth, just because some California bureaucrats are mad.**

But wait, it gets better. **There are 7,080,000 shares short**. The same smooth brains who thought betting against American oil during a national energy emergency was a good idea. Meanwhile, insiders own 14.30% and institutions own 26.19% of the float. And these aren't day-trading paper hands - these are long-term holders who actually read 10-Ks and understand what's about to happen.

Let me explain why the courts don't matter here, because this is where the genius of SOC's position comes in. The executive order isn't just some vague policy statement - it creates immediate emergency powers that work NOW, while any legal challenges would take years to resolve. By the time any court case gets serious, the oil will already be flowing.

Think about how the timeline works: SOC has until January 2026 to restart production. Court cases about federal emergency powers typically take 2-3 years minimum to reach any serious resolution. You see where this is going? The feds can start overriding California tomorrow, and by the time any judge gets involved, SOC will already be printing money.

And this isn't even considering the national security angle. **Courts have historically bent the knee when it comes to national security declarations**. The executive order specifically frames California's regulatory system as a threat to national security.

**But here's the part that makes this a truly asymmetric bet: SOC doesn't even need to win every regulatory fight. They just need to get their existing infrastructure back online. We're not talking about building new oil platforms here. Everything already exists - the platforms, the processing facility, the pipelines. They just need to fix some pipes and flip the switch.**

Let's talk about how fucking stupid the current valuation is. SOC is sitting on 646 MILLION barrels of oil. At current prices around $80/barrel, that's $51.7 BILLION worth of oil. Yet the entire company is valued at $2.33B. Yes, you read that right. The market is pricing this like the oil will never flow.

'But what if oil prices drop?' Even at $40/barrel, this thing prints money. The infrastructure is already built. The wells are already drilled. This isn't some speculative play where they need to find oil - they already have it. They just need regulatory permission to turn it back on.

**Now let's talk about the short squeeze potential, because it's juicier than your wife's boyfriend's gains. There are 7,080,000 shares short. These 🤡 are literally betting that:**

1. The federal government won't enforce its own emergency order
2. California will successfully fight the Defense Production Act
3. Courts will move faster than SOC's restart timeline
4. The CEO traded his private jet for shares because he's stupid

Here's why the shorts are about to learn about federal preemption the hard way: The executive order requires agencies to report on their emergency actions every 30 days. That means we're about to get a constant stream of catalysts as federal agencies start steamrolling state regulators.

**Risk/Reward? Let's break it down:** Downside: SOC completely fumbles the greatest regulatory gift in history and loses everything to Exxon in 2026. You lose your investment but keep a great story about that time the President declared a national emergency to help a stock you owned.

**Upside:** SOC uses federal power to restart production, trades up to peer valuations (5x), and potentially squeezes higher as shorts realize they bet against oil during an energy emergency.

**Positions or Ban:** Balls deep with 6000 shares, and more options in my wife's account.

\*Not financial advice. I just think when the President declares your regulatory problems a national emergency, something interesting might happen to your stock price.

P.S.: Yes, these are REAL oil fields that were ACTUALLY producing until 2015. This isn't some penny stock scam. This is boomer-grade assets with WSB-grade catalysts.

P.S.: For those asking about precedent - Secretary of Commerce overrode state objections in Millennium Pipeline case. This executive order is that case on steroids.

EDIT FORGOT TO MENTION.

**LA'S RECONSTRUCTION: WHY OIL DEMAND IS ABOUT TO GO PARABOLIC**

Rebuilding 12,300 destroyed structures is about to create massive oil demand that nobody's pricing in yet. This isn't just about construction - it's about the entire supply chain of rebuilding a major city.

**Think about what reconstruction requires: Diesel for thousands of construction vehicles and heavy equipment. Every bulldozer, crane, and dump truck runs on diesel. They'll be running 24/7 for months or years**.

Asphalt for roads and driveways that melted or got destroyed by heavy equipment. Asphalt is literally made from oil. Those 12,300 structures? Each one needs new access roads and driveways.

Plastics for everything from new plumbing to electrical conduits to insulation. Modern construction is basically impossible without petroleum products. Each rebuilt house needs thousands of pounds of plastic materials.

Transportation fuel for bringing in construction materials. Everything from lumber to steel to concrete has to be trucked in. The supply chain impact is massive.

Here's why this matters for SOC: California refineries are already running full tilt importing oil by tanker from overseas. Now they need to supply fuel for the biggest reconstruction effort in state history. And guess what sits idle just off their coast? **SOC's platforms that could supply that oil under U.S. environmental standards instead of importing it from Saudi Arabia.**

**The market hasn't priced this in yet because everyone's focused on the destruction rather than the reconstruction. But Trump's team gets it - that's why the executive order specifically targets West Coast energy infrastructure. They understand that rebuilding LA requires energy security.**

185,AAPL,Congrats to the new $1B space stock,"
Finally hit a Billy. Been waiting on this for years. $RDW is the Next Space Stock You Need to Watch – Bigger Than $ASTS or $RKLB?

NOTE: tried originally posting this on 10/14, 11/04, and 11/30 and WSB told me I couldn’t because RDW was “under 500m market cap” which is wasn’t … now trading &gt;$10 a share. 

I've been following $RDW (Redwire) for four years now, ever since it IPO’d via a SPAC. I originally owned the stock back at the IPO, sold it before it fully crashed down to $2, and repurchased 10,000 shares at ~$2.50. I’ve bought and sold on the way up and on dips, currently holding 4,500 shares with a cost basis of $3.83. I also hold two call contracts at a $4 strike price expiring in May 2025.

I’m a long-term believer in $RDW and believe it has the potential to be one of the biggest winners in the space industry long term, with significant potential for short-term spikes. This post isn’t about denouncing other space stocks but more about why I believe $RDW can be the winner we all want and need.

NOTE: before diving in, this was originally written on Oct 14, 2024. I’ve since updated this with current numbers as of Nov 30, 2024 





My Portfolio in the Space Sector (Oct 14, 2024):
To show you my broader conviction in space, here’s a quick rundown of my other holdings in the space sector:

-$RKLB: 4,500 shares, 4 call contracts at $2.50 strike, and 2 at $5 strike, expiring in Jan 2026
-$ASTS: 1,000 shares, cost basis ~$12 (sold 2,000 shares at $35 on a pump)
-$LUNR: Sold 5,000 shares and 10 call contracts at $5 on a recent contract pump, sold another 5,000 shares @14.7. 

PORTFOLIO HOLDINGS UPDATE AS OF NOV 30:
-$RDW: 4.500 shares, 2 call contracts at $4 strike expiring May 2025
-$RKLB: 3,100 shares, 2 call contracts at $2.5 strike expiring Jan 2026, 2 call contracts at $7 strike expiring Jan 2027 (Sold 500 @ 15, 500 @ 20, 400 @ 23.5)

Bought:
-$ACHR: 1,000 shares @ $6.18
-$JOBY: 750 shares @ $7.21
-$KULR: 4,000 shares @ $0.55
$GSAT: 2,000 @ $1.89

Sold all of my:
-$ASTS: 1,000 shares @ 30
-$LUNR: 5,000 shares @ 14.7

But my strongest conviction remains with $RDW and here’s why.

$RDW Performance &amp; Key Financials

Redwire has shown strong revenue growth but it’s flying under the radar compared to almost every single one of its peers. Here’s a breakdown of recent financials:

* 2023:
    * Revenue: $243.8 million (+51.9% YoY)
    * Net Loss: $(27.3) million
    * Adjusted EBITDA: $15.3 million

* Q1 2024:
    * Revenue: $87.8 million (+52.4% YoY)
    * Net Loss: $(8.1) million
    * Adjusted EBITDA: $4.3 million

* Q2 2024:
    * Revenue: $78.1 million (+30.0% YoY)
    * Net Loss: $(18.1) million
    * Adjusted EBITDA: $1.6 million

* Full-Year 2024 Guidance:
    * Revenue: $310 million (+27% YoY)

For comparison, here’s how other space stocks stack up:
* $RKLB (Rocket Lab):
    * 2023 
        * Revenue: $244.6 million (+16% YoY)
        * Net loss: $(182.6) million
    * Q1 2024:
        * Revenue: $92.77 million
    * Q2 2024 
        * Revenue: $106.3 million (+71% YoY)
        * Net Loss: $(41.6) million in Q2 2024
        * GAAP EPS of -$0.08
* $LUNR:
    * 2023 Revenue: $60.5 million
    * Q1 2024 Revenue: $73.07 million 
    * Q2 2024 Revenue: $41 million
* $ASTS
    * 2023 Revenue: $0
    * Q1 2024 Revenue: $500 thousand
    * Q2 2024 Revenue: $900 thousand

Valuation Insights: Why $RDW is Undervalued

Now, let’s talk about valuation. When looking at revenue versus market cap, $RDW is trading at a much lower multiple than its peers, despite earning more and losing less than almost all of them. This presents a strong case for potential upside if the market starts to recognize its growth.

* $RDW 
    * Market Cap: $524.3M (as of Oct 14 at $7.88/share)
        * As of Nov 30, market cap is now $928.9m
    * Revenue multiple: Just 1.69x revenue
        * As of Nov 30, revenue multiple is 3x
* For comparison:
    * $RKLB: ~10x revenue
        * As of Nov 30, 25x 
    * $ASTS: 100x revenue
    * $LUNR: ~2-2.5x revenue
        * As of Nov 30, 4.5x
* Why This Matters
    * A lower revenue multiple suggests that $RDW is currently undervalued relative to its peers. It’s trading at just 1.69x revenue, compared to $RKLB’s 10x or $SPCE’s 15x, despite immense market traction and success. If Redwire continues on its growth trajectory, this gap in valuation could close quickly, creating a significant upside opportunity.

Proven Track Record

$RDW has been involved in space missions for more than 50 years, supporting missions to practically every planet in our solar system. 
* Sun: 3 missions
* Mercury: 2 missions
* Venus: 3 missions
* Earth: 20 missions
* ISS: 12 missions
* Moon: 4 missions
* Mars: 7 missions
* Asteroids: 3
* Jupiter: 2
* Saturn: 1
* Pluto: 1

Capabilities &amp; Future Potential

Redwire is also positioned to be a leader in several emerging space technologies, including multiple areas I’ve seen highlighted for other companies in WSB over the years. Their capabilities include:
* Microgravity payload development and operations: https://stocks.apple.com/A0yZ91oA9SHucXaTUWqzhbg 
* Very Low Earth Orbit (VLEO) platforms: https://redwirespace.com/capabilities/vleo/

Redwire is positioned as a leader in several emerging space technologies that could be game-changers in the next decade. The possibilities here are immense—especially with space-based manufacturing, pharma, and autonomous operations becoming key areas of growth in the sector.

The Opportunity: Why Now is the Time

With everything mentioned above, $RDW presents a major opportunity, but here’s why now could be the time to get in:
* Outstanding shares: 66.54M
* Float: 24.26M (very small compared to peers):
    * $RKLB: 340M
    * $ASTS: 122M
    * $LUNR: 57M
* Short interest: 2.58M shares (10.62% of float)
    * As of Nov 30, short interest is 3M (12% of float)
* Average daily volume: 340k (very low compared to peers):
    * $LUNR: 14.2M
    * $RKLB: 13.1M
    * $ASTS: 16.9M
* Average Daily Volume as of Nov 30: 481k
    * $LUNR: 19.18m
    * $RKLB: 18.52m
    * $ASTS: 12.83m

Low float and low trading volume make $RDW more prone to sharp price movements, especially if the market starts to recognize the value that’s been overlooked. Add to that the upcoming earnings reports and potential contracts in the pipeline, and you have a recipe for significant price action.

Conclusion:
Given $RDW’s impressive revenue growth, proven track record, undervaluation compared to peers, and potential for short-term spikes due to low float and trading volume, this is a stock to keep an eye on. While I hold positions in other space stocks, my conviction in $RDW remains the strongest for long-term growth.
* Past
    * Jan 1, 2024: $2.96 ($196.9m market cap - lower than the 2023 revenue)
    * Oct 14: $7.88 (524.3m market cap)
* Today:
    * Nov 30: $13.96 (928.9m market cap)
* Future Potential?:
    * $20 ($1.33b market cap // 4x 2024 rev)
    * $50 ($3.32b market cap // 10x 2024 rev)
    * $100 ($6.65b market cap // 20x 2024 rev)
    * …you can do the math from here

The Opportunity: Why Now is the Time

* Short interest: 2.58M shares (10.62% of float)

Low float and low trading volume make $RDW more prone to sharp price movements, especially if the market starts to recognize the value that’s been overlooked. Add to that the upcoming earnings reports and potential contracts in the pipeline, and you have a recipe for significant price action.

Conclusion:
Given $RDW’s impressive revenue growth, proven track record, undervaluation compared to peers, and potential for short-term spikes due to low float and trading volume, this is a stock to keep an eye on. While I hold positions in other space stocks, my conviction in $RDW remains the strongest for long-term growth.

TSMC is the true winner(assuming China doesn't invade)","Right now, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Meta are all spending more than Nvidia on R&amp;D and are developing their own AI chips. Tesla, and AMD are also developing AI chips. Right now, tech companies are only buying Nvidia's chips to get started and build market share, because they do not want to fall behind their competition. 

Using Nvidia's chips at current prices is not profitable, even successful AI companies such as OpenAI fail to achieve positive operating margins despite a highly popular product with paid features. Large tech companies are reluctantly buying Nvidia's hardware to avoid falling behind their competition in market share. But relying on Nvidia long term is never the intention, these companies need to be profitable eventually, Nvidia is just there to get them started.

The thing is, Nvidia's 74.56% gross margin is a strength, but its also a vulnerability. It demonstrates that any AI company that can cut out Nvidia can significantly reduce their costs, and that's why everyone is building their own chips. They don't need to be faster than Nvidia to succeed, they just need to be fast enough to provide services at a lower cost, which is quite a low bar. Developing new products takes time, which is why Nvidia's windfall has lasted. But give it 1-3 more years and you'll start to see the impact on Nvidia's sales.

With everyone rushing to develop their own chips, and all of them relying on TSMC, TSMC has the true windfall. They will certainly be able to hike their prices on wafers due to increased demand, which will hurt Nvidia's margins.

Intel was once a dominant and unstoppable player in the semiconductor space, but then they got too comfortable and started spending their cash flow on dividends and stock buybacks instead of reinvesting in R&amp;D. We see how that played out, with AMD catching up and stealing market share, and now Intel is struggling. No moat is impenetrable.

Nvidia is following in Intel's footsteps with their $50 Billion stock buyback plan at 50x earnings. Despite facing competition from the largest tech companies with deep pockets, they are spending their record windfall just to buy back less than 2% of their shares outstanding. This will be their downfall. They are not hedging their reliance on TSMC by seeking to acquire or develop their own fab business, they are not increasing R&amp;D sufficiently to stay ahead of their competition. This will be their downfall.

In 5-10 years, Nvidia will almost certainly have thinner margins and less market share in the AI space as their customers develop their own in-house solutions.

**Overview**

On December 5th, Bigo Live was removed from both the iOS and Android app stores [following reports in the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/07/us/child-abuse-apple-google-apps.html?unlocked_article_code=1.hE4.IjV3.IUb4nn1olfoc&amp;smid=url-share.) of the app allowing users to pay to watch livestreams of child sexual abuse. The app is still gone (search in your app store)

Joyy ($YY) is a Chinese social media company that gets most of its revenue from the Bigo Live app.

This doesn't seem to be covered anywhere related to $YY - for example [on Marketwatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/yy). Presumably because this is a small-cap Chinese stock no one cares about. The stock is down about 3.5% since the news was reported.

**$YY Revenue Breakdown**

Looking at their [Q3 Earnings](https://ir.joyy.com/news-releases/news-release-details/joyy-reports-third-quarter-2024-unaudited-financial-results) \- **BIGO apps are about 90% of their profit and revenue.**

Two other apps, IMO and Likee are under BIGO here - but are about 10% of the total revenue

So Bigo Live alone should be around 80% of $YY’s revenue and profit.

It’s worth noting that average revenue per paying user over the quarter was **$231** \- their content clearly monetized well.

They do have a website - [bigo.tv](http://bigo.tv) \- but I suspect it’s a small portion of their revenue. They don’t break out the data in their last [annual report](https://ir.joyy.com/static-files/de629d35-c15e-4046-82d7-856fddbd1d41) but they do say

This doesn't seem to be covered anywhere related to $YY - for example [on Marketwatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/yy). Presumably because this is a small-cap Chinese stock no one cares about. The stock is down about 3.5% since the news was reported.

**$YY Revenue Breakdown**

Looking at their [Q3 Earnings](https://ir.joyy.com/news-releases/news-release-details/joyy-reports-third-quarter-2024-unaudited-financial-results) \- **BIGO apps are about 90% of their profit and revenue.**

Two other apps, IMO and Likee are under BIGO here - but are about 10% of the total revenue

So Bigo Live alone should be around 80% of $YY’s revenue and profit.

It’s worth noting that average revenue per paying user over the quarter was **$231** \- their content clearly monetized well.

They do have a website - [bigo.tv](http://bigo.tv) \- but I suspect it’s a small portion of their revenue. They don’t break out the data in their last [annual report](https://ir.joyy.com/static-files/de629d35-c15e-4046-82d7-856fddbd1d41) but they do say

Unity Software Inc. (doing business as **Unity Technologies**) is a technology company that specializes in developing and operating a platform for creating real-time 3D content and experiences. Unity is primarily known for its game engine and development tools, which allow creators to build, run, and monetize interactive 2D and 3D content across various platforms.

Their engine and development tools is used in wide range of industries including Video game development , architecture and design , automotive , film and animation , and virtual and augmented reality.

They are a duopoly in the game engine market with Epic Games (Unreal Engine). Unity holds approximately 40-50% of the game engine market share, while Unreal Engine accounts for 10-20%. As of 2023, over 70% of the top mobile games globally were developed using Unity's platform. In 2024, mobile gaming is expected to generate approximately $92.6 billion in revenue compared to $51.9 billion for console gaming and $40 billion for PC gaming. As of 2024, a significant portion of VR apps in the Apple Store are likely created using Unity, with estimates suggesting that over 60% of AR/VR content across platforms is made with Unity.

Unity's stock have been doing poorly ever since the great 2022 bear market , the John Riccitiello fee incident (2022) , and the dreadful IronSource purchase (2022) under his tenure. They have since fired him in 2023 and appointed Matthew Bromberg as Unity's new Chief Executive Officer, President, and a member of the Unity Board of Directors, effective May 15, 2024. Bromberg has since replaced all the C-suites with competent people. They did a reset on their portfolio to put their focus on their core business which they refer to as their ""Strategic Portfolio"": the Engine, Cloud and Monetization.

The Strategic Portfolio consists of two main segments:

* Create Solutions: This segment encompasses Unity's game development platform and tools. In Q3 2024, Create Solutions revenue grew 5% year-over-year, driven by subscription growth. The Create segment includes:

1. Unity game engine and development tools
2. Unity 6, the latest version of the engine with over 500,000 downloads
3. Expansion into non-gaming industries (Industry segment), which grew **59% year-over-year and represents 18% of Create revenue**

* Grow Solutions: This segment includes advertising and monetization tools. In Q3 2024, Grow Solutions revenue declined by 5%. It focuses on:

1. Advertising technology
2. Monetization services for game developers
3. Development of a new advertising model set to launch in 2025

Let's discuss the mobile gaming monetization and advertising space and their competitor AppLovin (the stock that is up 768% YTD) . AppLovin wanted to buy Unity for $20B back in 2022 to form a monopoly but got rejected. Unity has since failed to keep up with AppLovin who is now the third largest mobile gaming in-app advertising network after Google and Meta. Unity-ironSource platform couldn't compete with AppLovin's platform but things are about to change because the new CEO hired Jim Payne to join the company as Chief Product Officer for Advertising effective August 12, 2024. Payne co-founded MoPub, the world’s largest mobile in-app ad server and exchange, and MAX Advertising Systems, a mobile header bidding platform (both acquired by AppLovin and are essential pieces to their success). In their latest earning's call Bromberg said they have a new machine learning model in their new neural network that is being tested on their live data that will be ready to launch when it's ready (probably sometime next year). APP's current mcap is $111B while Unity is at $10.78B , if their new ML model is competitive , the stock can easily **10x from here just from the Grow Solutions business**. This is why some people are looking to short AppLovin and long Unity.

On the Create Solution side Unity recently announced on Oct 30, 2024 they hired Ex-King CTO and Havok Co-Founder Steve Collins as CTO which will add key technical leadership to accelerate product innovation, quality, and stability.  In 2023, Havok products were used in twelve of the top twenty best selling video games in the United States. Their 3D engine is utilized not only for game development but also by a diverse range of clients in non-gaming industries for real-time product visualization, virtual prototyping, AR customer experiences, digital twins and other 3D applications. This segment grew 59% year-over-year and is expected to become an increasingly significant contributor to their Create revenue in the future.

Unity's engine and development tools is also utilized by the The Department of Defense (DoD). They primarily use the Unity engine to create realistic, immersive virtual training simulations for military personnel, allowing them to practice complex scenarios in a safe and controlled environment across various domains like combat tactics, vehicle operation, war simulations and situational awareness, all within a 3D digital world.

Unity Technologies Corporation (UnityTec) has been awarded two significant contracts related to the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD):

* [JETS 2.0 Contract](https://govtribe.com/opportunity/federal-contract-opportunity/dla-j6-enterprise-technology-services-jets-2-dot-0-sp470923r0001-45) : UnityTec secured a position on the Defense Logistics Agency's J6 Enterprise Technologies Services 2.0 (JETS 2.0) multiple-award, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract. This contract has a maximum value of $12 billion and will provide a broad range of IT-related services to the entire DoD for up to 12 years.
* CACI Contract: Unity signed a ""multi-million dollar"" contract with enterprise technology firm CACI to become the ""preferred real-time 3D platform"" for U.S. government defense projects.

Now back in 2015 [Mark Zuckerberg sent a four page internal email](https://sriramk.com/memos/zuck-unity.pdf) to key executives to get in early on the AR and VR future. In that email , Mark Zuckerberg wanted to purchase Unity because he believes AR/VR is the major computing platform after mobile and they will gain control over a key development platform for AR/VR content. He believes the acquisition of Unity would also mitigate the risk of a competitors like Google and Apple from acquiring them and limiting Meta (Facebook then) access to the platform. One of the possible reasons the acquisition fell through is antitrust concerns because Meta would be a monopoly in VR/AR if they own Unity.

I believe the future is XR (extended reality) and that XR will be next major and **final computing platform** after mobile. I believe Meta could potentially become the largest company in the world within the next 10-20 years if Apple/Google/Microsoft don't catch up in XR especially in AR which Meta is leading. Regardless of who wins, **Unity will be a key pillar driving the XR gold rush**. In conclusion, I’m highly optimistic about Unity, as they hold a vital role in the XR ecosystem. This is a long-term investment for generational wealth.

This post is made for posterity.

* CACI Contract: Unity signed a ""multi-million dollar"" contract with enterprise technology firm CACI to become the ""preferred real-time 3D platform"" for U.S. government defense projects.

Now back in 2015 [Mark Zuckerberg sent a four page internal email](https://sriramk.com/memos/zuck-unity.pdf) to key executives to get in early on the AR and VR future. In that email , Mark Zuckerberg wanted to purchase Unity because he believes AR/VR is the major computing platform after mobile and they will gain control over a key development platform for AR/VR content. He believes the acquisition of Unity would also mitigate the risk of a competitors like Google and Apple from acquiring them and limiting Meta (Facebook then) access to the platform. One of the possible reasons the acquisition fell through is antitrust concerns because Meta would be a monopoly in VR/AR if they own Unity.

I believe the future is XR (extended reality) and that XR will be next major and **final computing platform** after mobile. I believe Meta could potentially become the largest company in the world within the next 10-20 years if Apple/Google/Microsoft don't catch up in XR especially in AR which Meta is leading. Regardless of who wins, **Unity will be a key pillar driving the XR gold rush**. In conclusion, I’m highly optimistic about Unity, as they hold a vital role in the XR ecosystem. This is a long-term investment for generational wealth.

This post is made for posterity.

209,AAPL,China's domination playbook. How China dominates industry after industry.,"This is not the full story, but it is a very important story. Let's talk about how China dominates industry after industry. I will use the term ""China"" because Chinese government is highly involved in making Chinese manufacturers dominant.

**Part 1 – What is happening in automotive?**

In mere 3 years, China became the world's largest car exporter. The growth hasn't stopped either. The playbook that China is using is not new, we've seen it before. In solar panels, smartphones and a bunch of other industries. Let's talk about that playbook further down.

[From: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/1h9idy8\/](https://preview.redd.it/e4fn1lzarn5e1.png?width=1220&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f3b7d8ae6b41af72118921dea652a78f4995af1)

**Part 2 – Smartphones showed the way**

Around 2005, Chinese mobile phones were shit. They were mostly knockoffs of Nokia, SonyEricsson, Samsung and other established makers. Really bad knockoffs as well. Cheap, nasty, unreliable, uncomfortable user interface, etc. Market share outside China was near 0%.

Around 2010, large part of Chinese mobile phones were still knockoffs (examples [here](https://www.intomobile.com/2009/07/25/this-week-in-fake-devices-3-sony-ericsson-clones/) and [here](https://www.intomobile.com/2009/07/25/this-week-in-fake-devices-3-sony-ericsson-clones/)). But you now had som ok-ish Chinese products, e.g. [Huawei U8150](https://www.gsmarena.com/huawei_u8150_ideos-3513.php), [Lenovo Q330](https://www.gsmarena.com/lenovo_q330-4860.php), [ZTE Blade](https://www.gsmarena.com/zte_blade-3391.php), [Meizu MX](https://www.gsmarena.com/meizu_mx-4373.php) and others. They were not good, but they were passable.

In less than 10 years, before 2020, some of the world's best smartphones were from Chinese makers. [Huawei Mate 20 Pro](https://www.gsmarena.com/huawei_mate_20_pro-9343.php), [OnePlus 7T Pro](https://www.gsmarena.com/huawei_mate_20_pro-9343.php), [Oppo Reno 10x](https://www.gsmarena.com/oppo_reno_10x_zoom-9654.php) and others.

Just before US sanctions, Huawei was world's largest smartphone maker for one quarter. It was about to cement its place as #1. But Huawei got sanctioned and Huawei phones are now barely visible outside of China. What is much less known, is that another Chinese maker become world's largest and it did it so subtly that almost no one knows it. BBK Electronics was similar to VW Group and GM – it owned owned many Chinese makers (Oppo, Vivo, OnePlus, Realme, Iqoo and others). BBK Electronics was world's largest, larger than Apple or Samsung for years. It is now dissolved and is officially not the sole owner, but the all the BBK Electronics brands remain alive and well. They are dominant in many countries around the world. Today, Chinese smartphone makers have more than 60% of global market share. That's dominance.

And that dominance is being acquired in industry after industry.

**Part 3 – China is now dominant in smartphones**

It's all China, apart apart from Apple and Samsung. The remaining non-Chinese makers are super-small, like Sony (Japan), Asus (Taiwan) or Micromax (India) which hold much less than 1% each. Other than Apple and Samsung, it's all China – Xiaomi, Motorola (owned by Chinese Lenovo), Oppo, ZTE, Vivo and so on. China dominates worldwide smartphone market.

**Part 4 – What was the Chinese playbook for smartphones?**

It was a collection of factors, most notably:

1. Large covert govt subsidies.
2. Drive for local supply chain.
3. IP theft on industrial scale.
4. Protectionism in the local market.

Points #1 and #2 were especially impactful. Government subsidies allowed Chinese makers to offer lower prices, win marketshare (at the expense of others) and stay afloat much longer than they would have without the subsidies. This created much larger local production and much stronger supply chain locally in China. Apple's CEO Tim Cook has admitted that strong supply chain makes China much more favourable production location than the USA. Now, even without the cost advantage, China is the most favourable place for smartphone manufacturing. The playbook worked. And they're repeating it elsewhere.

**Part 5 – Same playbook in EVs**

Note how quickly Chinese smartphone makers went from utter garbage to world-class products. It took about 10 years. From there, it did not take long until China became dominant in the world market.

Same playbook is being used in many industries. The playbook worked wonders in solar panels, where China absolutely dominates the global market. The same playbook is now in EVs. And network equipment. And medical consumables. And industrial chemicals. And home appliances. And so on.

If this post reaches any Western automaker by some chance, I could happily share more over PM. For legacy automakers, brace for impact. Smartphone market of 2010 is mostly a graveyard (e.g. Nokia, SonyEricsson, LG, Palm, Blackberry), coma-patients (e.g. Sony, HTC) or Chinese-owned companies (Motorola).

210,AAPL,My thesis on INTC going into 2025,"I am going to add my technological and geopolitical fundamentals here, because I think these are going to be important factors heading into 2025. Disclaimer: I own 575 shares of Intel at an average PpS of $29.30

I think most analysts are forgetting that the next president is the same guy who is trying to block the acquisition of US steel by Nippon steel at all costs, regardless if it makes financial sense or not because he wants to retain as much American Manufacturing as possible and wants it to succeed.

Most of the ""AI revolution"" has happened over the past 4 years where the administration had no problem letting foreign chip manufacturing take the lead. Intel is competing with TSMC, and TSMC receives massive subsidies and discounts from the Taiwanese government which dwarf the 7.9B (which was even reduced) from the US government. On top of that, the US government is also giving slightly less in subsidies, 6.6B, to TSMC to build in the US. So really, the current administration is not giving Intel an advantage over TSMC. The most effective thing that they could do is levy tariffs against Taiwan, which the next president has gone on record stating he wishes to do, instead of subsidies. This would increase demand for American chip manufacturing; while TSMC can manufacture in the US, CoWoS packaging is done outside of the US, in either Malaysia or Taiwan, and would cause the product to be subject to tariffs.

In the chip design space, Intel is hopelessly behind on GPUs compared to Nvidia, and now Apple, Amazon, OpenAI and others are designing their own chips and using TSMC for manufacture. Intel still dominates the CPU space, but your average datacenter rack might have 10/20+ GPUs for each CPU. AMD is also a viable alternative to Intel for CPUs, and as such takes about 25% of the market. Intel's only way to compete in the GPU space is in the cost performance market, which mainly targets budget gaming, crypto mining, and cheap datacenter. The newest release of the ""Battlemage"" B580 is expected to compete with Nvidia's 4060 at the under $300 MSRP market, which are lofty goals. Nvidia and AMD still have offerings in these spaces but they are not lucrative ones. So Intel is basically competing to be a 3rd rate designer in the US, while they still have the CPU lead it matters a lot less for the lucrative markets right now.

It's clear that on the design front, Intel is not going to receive much help to be successful. While this is their core business and majority of revenue, it is a business they are falling behind substantially compared to others. Design demand is GPUs and they are late to this party. Revenue for products is expected to stagnate or decline unless they have a competitive GPU offering.

However, the US needs to have a domestic cutting edge chip manufacturing supply chain. It has expressed as much as a result of the 2022 supply chain shortage when we realized that letting TSMC manufacture 90% of the world's sub 5nm chips was a bad idea. That was the motivation behind passing the CHIPS act; Pat Gelsinger was instrumental in advising the current administration for this. The method for doing so has left a lot to be desired; Pat himself even expressed as much given the delay in fund disbursement, which in all fairness was only accelerated as a result of the election result and comments from republicans that they wanted to repeal the act.

TSMC is not allowed to have the latest node fabricated in the US by law of the Taiwanese government. This is so that the country keeps its ""Silicon Shield"", the dependence globally to have manufacturing be done there which keeps Taiwan protected from China. But Intel has no such limitation. And TSMC is not able to fufill 100% of the orders for its customers; it is aggressively building more fabs to keep up with the ever increasing demand of AI. This demand exists for Intel to take part of.

So, Intel in the next administration will have a tremendous amount of support for its Foundry, not Products, side of the business. This leaves Intel with a potential alternative to many of the scenarios analysts predict: It could solely dedicate to Foundry and sell off its Products division, most likely to AMD which shares the x86 architecture already and is solely focused on design. This would allow Intel to become a Foundry for external customers without having a conflict of interest, which I suspect is keeping them from customers. The CHIPS act stipulates that Intel has to retain a majority stake of Foundry but NOT Products, so this does not prevent Intel from dedicating itself to Foundry, which is what the US wants.

I think Pat was waiting for the right climate to do this and it is coming soon. It is sad he did not stay long enough to see it happen. If Intel received the same amount of support from the US government that the Taiwanese government gave to TSMC, and was able to win external customers as a result of Tariffs, it could become the US TSMC. Much of this hinges on the 18A and later 14A nodes which are competitive with TSMC 2nm, which is the current cutting edge. But I think this is the desire of Intel and the next administration, and so they will work towards this goal. To diminish foundry would be a slow death for Intel. That is why I am still looking forward to Intel in 2025.

If you got this far, thank you for reading.

EDIT: Now that I think about it, it is also entirely possible for Qualcomm to buy Intel's Products division. I think they expressed as much earlier this year, but being they are primarily ARM I am not sure if it would be a good fit.",157,165,1733555831.0,2024-12-07T07:17:11+00:00,t3_1h8n76e,"My thesis on INTC going into 2025 I am going to add my technological and geopolitical fundamentals here, because I think these are going to be important factors heading into 2025.

It is worth noting that since April this year, Apple's share price ushered in a sustained rise, has risen more than 45% over the closing low point on April 19 this year. The strong performance of Apple's stock price not only reflects the company's growth momentum, but also shows investors' confidence in its future development. What are the driving factors behind this upward trend?

  
Outstanding earnings performance. In the fourth fiscal quarter, when the new generation of iPhones just hit the market, the revenue of Apple's core product, iPhone, returned to positive growth, and the growth momentum exceeded Wall Street's expectations, driving the company's total revenue to a record high for the same period. The solid financial situation undoubtedly provides investors with confidence.

Technology innovation and AI strategic layout. While the core products are changing, Apple is also launching new products, from Apple Watch to smart home products, to meet the diversified needs of consumers. In addition, Apple's continued expansion in emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence has laid the foundation for its future growth with the gradual release of Apple's AI capabilities.

Global market expansion. Apple's sales revenue in Europe, Japan and other Asia-Pacific regions outside of China and Japan all accelerated in the fourth fiscal quarter, such as India, Southeast Asia and Africa, which have low smartphone penetration rates and huge market potential, are also growing rapidly. At the same time, Apple is also promoting the relocation of the industrial chain, especially to emerging markets such as India, with a view to further reducing costs, expanding production capacity and developing new market growth points.

215,AAPL,Where are future returns even supposed to come from? ,"Happy thanksgiving to all of you, I hope you are able to spend time with your loved ones. Just some discussion points about overall valuations in the equity markets. 

This is something that I have wondered for a while. Almost every asset under the sun has skyrocketed, and obviously people are planning to get a return on their investment, so let's discuss how this is even supposed to happen at this point. 

First, there's the low hanging fruit in terms of arguments supporting that we are in a wildly overvalued equity bubble. Dogecoin is worth more than Nintendo. Palantir trades at nearly 60x revenue and made a nanopenny of earnings on a market cap that is nearing ASML's. Tesla is worth $1.1T and thus somehow larger than berkshire. Carvana. I'm not even going to talk about bitcoin. These are prime examples of rampant market speculation and I believe nobody who has their two brain halves connected would argue that these are not cult assets that are disconnected from reality. 

But digging a bit deeper, the bubble doesn't remotely seem to be isolated to certain sectors. Apple is a lick away from 40x earnings. Walmart trades at nearly 40x earnings. Costco somehow manages to sell at nearly 60x earnings. Eli Lilly commands an 85x multiple as an entry price. ServiceNow trades at nearly 175x GAAP eps. These aren't 2021-style ARKK stocks but the largest companies in the world. 

Nvidia is probably the greatest financial success story of all time but they too quickly need to find another $80 billion of annual earnings somewhere otherwise they will also eventually implode like a neutron star. And all of that is happening while the 10-year yields close to 4.5%!

I mean, I like walmart and I like costco. They are good companies. It's a sticky business and they have carved out a nice piece of the U.S. economy for themselves. But Walmart does nearly $700b in revenue and has 3% operating margins. The current EPS yield is barely 2.5%. What is supposed to happen here? Earnings isnt expected to skyrocket and that multiple is so stretched that even 10% yearly EPS growth may leave bulls without a return until 2034. Never, even in my fever dreams, would I have believed that a company like costco would command a 60x premium. 

It seems to me that nearly any asset imaginable is wildly overbought and that people are just pouring they paychecks into the stock market because it has a history of only going up and to the right. But multiples are arguably way ahead of themselves. Current CAPE-ratio has only been higher during two times in history: 1929 and the dotcom bubble. This is kind of a cliché but at the same time, owning these stocks nets you nearly nothing. So what's the game here? Are people betting that Costco will trade at 80x earnings next year? 

Everything I know as a value investor tells me that this must end and that it is time to hedge. But at the same time, anyone who has shorted this ridiculous market has been ground to a pulp by the onslaught of endless liquidity that's pouring into the market. 

So what do you guys think? Are the U.S. stock markets about to pull a Nikkei and leave us all grinding our teeth until 2040 before a new high will be set? Hope that turkey tastes well by the way.

218,AAPL,PLTR: They said the quiet part out loud [DD],"On November 15, 2024, PLTR's board member Alex Moore tweeted,

&gt;We are moving PalantirTech to Nasdaq because it will force billions in ETF buying and deliver 'tendies' to our retail investors. Player haters be aware that we've been hated for decades (plural). Everything we do is to reward and support our retail diamondhands following.

Immediately afterwards, he deleted his tweet.

At first glance, the statement seems harmless, and even obvious. Companies are added/removed from passive indexes every day, and it's not a crime to want to deliver shareholder returns. There's no problem with boasting about passive index inclusion. It doesn't affect the fundamental business anyway.

Right?

I think otherwise.

Alex Moore said Palantir's quiet part out loud. I contend that this has been Palantir's gameplan since day one. **The stock's performance**, ridiculous valuation, and mania all **points back to one fundamental goal** of the company's management: **manipulating stock market indexes to juice valuation and provide liquidity for insider selling.**

**The Evidence (s/o Mike Green):**

**Part 1: The Listing**

Companies generally list via a direct listing, traditional IPO, or SPAC. For a company the size of PLTR, a SPAC was out of the question. They had to choose between an IPO and direct listing. Let's take a look at both.

**Traditional IPO**: Typically involves investment banks underwriting the deal, setting a price, and selling shares to institutional investors like mutual funds or hedge funds. Importantly, these shares are **not** part of the stock's free float, and insiders must dilute themselves in order to create new shares to sell on the public market.

**Direct Listing**: In a direct listing, a company offers existing shares directly to the public without issuing new shares or raising capital. This avoids traditional IPO underwriters (investment bank). The free float is immediately determined by shares held by insiders available to sell. Palantir chose this route.

**Takeaway:** In a **direct listing**, all existing shares held by insiders, employees, and early investors become eligible for public trading immediately. There is **no lock-up period** (common in traditional IPOs, where insiders are restricted from selling shares for 6–12 months). This approach ensures a **larger float** right from the start, as insiders can sell their shares directly on the public market if they choose, increasing the number of shares available for trading.

Why is this important?

Palantir almost immediately qualified for index inclusion upon its first day of listing. Vanguard and others were forced to buy shares on the **first week** of listing because Palantir met the necessary requirements for most broad market indexes:

1. Market Cap - This is self explanatory, Palantir began listing at \~17B market cap, rendering it eligible for most indexes.
2. Free Float - Indexes are not just weighted by a company's market cap. The S&amp;P500, for example, uses **Float-Adjusted Market Cap**, adjusting the company’s market capitalization based on its free float to determine its weight in the index. Float-Adjusted Market Cap=Share Price×Free Float Shares
3. Liquidity - Also a no brainer, considering the number of shares immediately available for the public, and the hype around the stock.

It doesn't take a genius to see it. As insiders sell shares, the “effective float” rose, requiring extra purchases from index providers, and helping Palantir insiders exit.

**Part 2: Buying a Seat at the Table**

2021-2022 was tough for Palantir. The index game was faltering as net income and revenue growth lagged. This threatened their ultimate goal of S&amp;P500 + Nasdaq 100 inclusion. They had the market cap, if they could only find a way to juice their revenue in a profitable way to get themselves over the inclusion requirements!

So, they did what any reasonable company in this situation would do, and bought customers. Financing customer growth by [investing roughly $450MM in over two dozen SPACs](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-11-29/palantir-failed-to-spot-pattern-in-spac-debacle), Palantir was basically [buying revenue.](https://www.newcomer.co/p/is-palantir-buying-revenue)

The process was straightforward:

1. PLTR would invest in the SPAC and assume a significant controlling interest
2. PLTR would use the SPAC's funds to purchase PLTR services
3. Any operating losses of the SPAC company could be carefully hidden from PLTR's reporting.

[Not part of operating income!](https://preview.redd.it/ydfikqj6vy2e1.jpg?width=1254&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=19a6a7d123b4cf926e5dd07b1ce374ac30061bb2)

And, soon enough, PLTR was (technically) reporting profitability by GAAP standards! With the company now profitable, in 2024 it became eligible for SP500 inclusion, and was included in September 2024, coinciding with a face-melting rally.

**Part 3: The Next Frontier**

To wind out its strategy, Palantir wants to maximize the benefits of index inclusion, capped off by its **relisting to Nasdaq** to position itself for entry into the Nasdaq-100 (QQQ).

The timing of the move is also suspect. The index’s modified market cap weighting system limits the concentration of its top three constituents, disproportionately favoring mid-tier companies ranked between #10 and #30 in market cap—exactly where Palantir has maneuvered itself.

This move is no coincidence. Palantir’s ownership by the big three institutional investors—Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street—has soared to an impressive **22.23%**, surpassing even tech giants like **Microsoft (20.5%)**, **Apple (20.0%)**, and **NVIDIA (20.17%)**. For a company that only went public in Q4-2020, this level of institutional backing is ridiculous for a company of this size.

And the insiders? They're loving the exit liquidity.

https://preview.redd.it/2ovaqp09vy2e1.jpg?width=1456&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c9e88a0d96b9b0e6402d50835979bd1d34530e2

In fact, they've been dumping into the institutions (and retail) this whole time:

https://preview.redd.it/2p4k1qx7vy2e1.png?width=1022&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b0be708d61438cdcf2e779d1216cd3e9696140a

""Show me the incentive, and I will tell you the outcome.""

Institutional shareholders through indexes are the easiest exit liquidity in the world for insiders. They're brainless, rules-based buyers. And, once the entire world owns an equal share of your company, priced at 50x sales, and you've dumped most of your shares, you could give a fuck less what the market ultimately does with your stock!

Of course, index inclusion for this stock has coincided with a complete disconnect from the fundamentals. The net \~3B of projected inflows from the QQQ have contributed about 40-50B of market cap growth in just the past few weeks.

Overall, I think there's huge problems with how companies are intentionally trying to juice themselves into indexes, knowing it's full of bloat and thoughtless exit liquidity. PLTR is just one of many, and they're giving a master class in index manipulation as we speak.

TL;DR: The recent PLTR tweet about joining the QQQ was a deeper insight into strategic yet dubious decisions the company has made for years in order to increase institutional ownership to fund insider selling and pump the stock outside of business fundamentals.",1869,363,1732505208.0,2024-11-25T03:26:48+00:00,t3_1gz9jf7,"PLTR: They said the quiet part out loud [DD] On November 15, 2024, PLTR's board member Alex Moore tweeted,

1. PLTR would invest in the SPAC and assume a significant controlling interest
2. PLTR would use the SPAC's funds to purchase PLTR services
3. Any operating losses of the SPAC company could be carefully hidden from PLTR's reporting.

[Not part of operating income!](https://preview.redd.it/ydfikqj6vy2e1.jpg?width=1254&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=19a6a7d123b4cf926e5dd07b1ce374ac30061bb2)

And, soon enough, PLTR was (technically) reporting profitability by GAAP standards! With the company now profitable, in 2024 it became eligible for SP500 inclusion, and was included in September 2024, coinciding with a face-melting rally.

**Part 3: The Next Frontier**

To wind out its strategy, Palantir wants to maximize the benefits of index inclusion, capped off by its **relisting to Nasdaq** to position itself for entry into the Nasdaq-100 (QQQ).

The timing of the move is also suspect. The index’s modified market cap weighting system limits the concentration of its top three constituents, disproportionately favoring mid-tier companies ranked between #10 and #30 in market cap—exactly where Palantir has maneuvered itself.

This move is no coincidence. Palantir’s ownership by the big three institutional investors—Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street—has soared to an impressive **22.23%**, surpassing even tech giants like **Microsoft (20.5%)**, **Apple (20.0%)**, and **NVIDIA (20.17%)**. For a company that only went public in Q4-2020, this level of institutional backing is ridiculous for a company of this size.

And the insiders? They're loving the exit liquidity.

In fact, they've been dumping into the institutions (and retail) this whole time:

https://preview.redd.it/2p4k1qx7vy2e1.png?width=1022&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b0be708d61438cdcf2e779d1216cd3e9696140a

""Show me the incentive, and I will tell you the outcome.""

Institutional shareholders through indexes are the easiest exit liquidity in the world for insiders. They're brainless, rules-based buyers. And, once the entire world owns an equal share of your company, priced at 50x sales, and you've dumped most of your shares, you could give a fuck less what the market ultimately does with your stock!

Of course, index inclusion for this stock has coincided with a complete disconnect from the fundamentals. The net \~3B of projected inflows from the QQQ have contributed about 40-50B of market cap growth in just the past few weeks.

Overall, I think there's huge problems with how companies are intentionally trying to juice themselves into indexes, knowing it's full of bloat and thoughtless exit liquidity. PLTR is just one of many, and they're giving a master class in index manipulation as we speak.

TL;DR: The recent PLTR tweet about joining the QQQ was a deeper insight into strategic yet dubious decisions the company has made for years in order to increase institutional ownership to fund insider selling and pump the stock outside of business fundamentals.",0.026811202988028526,0.047287046909332275,0.9259017705917358,neutral,0.9259017705917358,-0.02047584392130375

221,AAPL,$ACHR The Bull Run Hasn't Started Yet,"**TLDR:** Current fair value is +$10imo, Archer is currently the leader and will likely be the first to market, Major upcoming catalysts: Factory opening by the end of next month, Initiation of manufacturing in Jan, Final FAA certification, and Trump Presidency.

Archer Aviation ($ACHR) recently delivered a strong Q3 earnings call, highlighting significant advancements in their journey to commercialize eVTOL technology. With robust financials, strategic partnerships, New Trump Administration, and progress in FAA certification, Archer is positioning itself to outpace competitors and become the first to market in the eVTOL industry.

# Archer Will Likely Be The First To Market

Archer Aviation ($ACHR) is likely to be the **first to market** in the eVTOL industry, even outpacing Joby Aviation. How? Their focus on **scalability and an efficient supply chain** sets them apart. They've strategically outsourced about **80% of their major components** to established **Tier 1 suppliers** who have FAA certification expertise. This traditional aerospace model **reduces development risks, speeds up the certification process, and taps into existing supply chains for faster scalability.** Basically, they're not trying to reinvent the wheel, and it's paying off big time. This approach reduces development risks, speeds up the certification process, and utilizes existing supply chains for faster scalability.

In contrast, Joby follows a vertically integrated model, designing and manufacturing most components in-house, which allows for greater control and potentially higher performance but involves higher capital costs, longer certification timelines, and scaling challenges due to the novelty of its components. This difference in strategy positions Archer for a quicker and more efficient path to market.

As **Archer tweeted on Friday**, Archer's type-design is now **matured**, and they're ready to start producing piloted aircraft as soon as their **factory opens** at the **end of this year.** These aircraft will be operational by the beginning of 2025, with plans for piloted demonstrations and market survey flights with passengers throughout the year.

# Trumps Interest in VTOLs and The New Secretary of Transportation

President Donald Trump recently announced his administration’s support for VTOL technology, recognizing its transformative potential for economic growth and national security. Adding to this momentum, among Trump's picks for Secretary of Transportation is **Emil Michael**. If appointed, he has close ties to **Archer’s Chief Commercial Officer, Nihil Goel as he tweeted on Saturday.** This relationship could facilitate smoother regulatory pathways for Archer as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) finalizes critical rules for advanced air mobility. With the **new Trump administration,** Archer is poised to **benefit** from from significant political and regulatory tailwinds that could accelerate its growth in a market projected to reach **$1 trillion by 2040**.

# Financially Strong As Mentioned in Q3 Call

As mentioned in their Q3 call, Archer ended the quarter with over **$500 million** in cash reserves(with an additional 400M unaccounted for). With a quarterly cash burn of about **$80-90 million**, this gives them a solid **18-month runway**. This strong cash position is further **strengthened** by their partnership with **Stellantis**, which has agreed to contribute up to **$400 million** to help scale the manufacturing of Archer's Midnight aircraft. This capital **will cover manufacturing labor costs and capital expenditures for initial production at their new facility in Georgia.** By outsourcing 80% of their components to established suppliers, they've managed to keep operational costs in check while accelerating production timelines.

Additionally, Archer has issued **$30 million** in performance warrants to Stellantis, which will vest upon achieving certain milestones. They also have contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense worth up to **$148 million**.

# AHCR Fair valuation +$10

After their Q3 earnings call, Archer received many analyst upgrades ranging between $10-12 PT. While Archer is ahead of JOBY in my opinion and will enter the market first, currently there's such a significant difference in market caps between Archer and Joby.

Joby is trading at **$6.14** with a market cap of **$4.72 billion**, while **Archer Aviation (ACHR)** is at **$5.00** with a market cap of only **$2.15 billion**. If we compare apples to apples, Archer should be valued potentially around **$12**. In fact, Archer is ahead imo due to its scalability, reliance on established parts suppliers, and lower costs. Their strategy will speeds up the FAA certification process and allows for quicker scalability. On the other hand, Joby's vertically integrated model, while offering more control, comes with higher capital costs, longer certification timelines, and scaling challenges. This difference in approach positions Archer for a faster and more efficient path to market, making the current valuation gap seem unjustified.

224,AAPL,My views on why NVDA beats earnings and flies to higher supports. Likley past 200. ,"For the PE bitchers and moaners, I leave you this:

AMD Trailing Twelve Month ACTUAL PE is: 126  

NVDA Trailing Twelve Month ACTUAL PE is: 69 


Chanos bitched and moaned all the way to the broke house where he had to close shop. Tesla preaching and evangelizing the PE did him an apostate. He's done. TESLA CRUSHED HIM. Tesla easily slid into it's PE and Chanos is no more. Same thing happened with the bitchers and moaners with Amazon, Google, etc. When a company is a quality company and especially part of the SP500, where every iteration of that index HAS TO PURCHASE this stock, you ride well, and the company easily slides well into it's PE very well and snuggly like. 

Just like Zuckerberg sucker punched Open AI LLM's by making it's LLM open source and scorching the Earth, So goes NVDA: Open sourcing their DATA CENTER TECH, ( a little secret, its not just about the GPU, it's the entire package, it's not just about BLACKWELL GPU. But Rack/ Data Center Tech Design and Architecture, there will BE ZERO INCENTIVE FOR CUSTOMERS TO GO TO COMPETITORS WHEN RACK ARCHITECTURE THAT FITS BLACKWELL GPU's with ZERO ISSUE, IS COMPLETELY OUT IN THE OPEN: READ SUMMARY( this is why AMD and INTEL are having such a hard time competing and frankly anybody else, unless you're DELL and WORKING with Jensen... But Dell doesn't make chips, so their good bros and compliment each other very well in many ways, STILL NVDA HAS IT'S OWN DATA CENTER RACK TECHNOLOGY THAT IS NOT DELL'S AND IT IS NOW OPEN SOURCE- FROM COOLING TO ETHERNET AND SCALING DATA TECHNOLOGY... GIVING THEM A MASSIVE ADVANTAGE.. vs those that want to take away their Data Center Service / Business :

This OCP summit with this open sourcing debut specifically for Blackwell tech was as of last month, Oct 17th.

( Jensen is busy busy busy )  
""At this year’s OCP Global Summit, NVIDIA will be sharing key portions of the NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 system’s electro-mechanical design with the OCP community — including the rack architecture, compute and switch tray mechanicals, liquid-cooling and thermal environment specifications, and NVIDIA NVLink™ cable cartridge volumetrics—to support higher compute density and networking bandwidth.""

Everybody KNOWS there is a plateau. A plateau and lower business revenues based on estimates that TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THAT INFERENCE IS LESS DEMANDING THAN TRAINING. THAT BEING SAID, MARKET IS NO LONGER LOOKING FOR INSANE NUCLEAR GROWTH. BUT STEADY HEALTHY GROWTH. THAT\*\* WILL PROPEL THIS STOCK HIGHER.

Crazy AI nuclear growth, is not what the market is expecting. Market is expecting a healthy stable growth, now that we are near equilibrium with AI and chips, ( this is obviously not true, but it's the arguments bears try to hang on. They think Amazon will overtake a 30 year CUDA industry software environment the entire world/industry has created THEIR ENTIRE INFRASTRUCTURE, BOTH SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE AROUND). Go look up CUDA. It's older than many traders here. There is no world, or dimension, in the slightest, where a newcomer, or an online retailer, will wrap up 30yrs in a qtr or two. Or three, or four... NVDA continues to climb on growth, steady healthy growth, not insane nuclear growth. THAT WILL PROPEL THIS STOCK HIGHER. It has no where else to go. Ive's and Wedbush, are ENTIRELY correct.

Lastly NVDA will own the entire vertical from Hyperscaler to Retail Individual end user level, why? NVDA has proven that compute, it was never just a smaller and faster cpu, it was all about ACCELERATED compute with gpu architecture to get computation to the next level- why the AI revolution is here. IE Enter NVDA Retail PC / Lap Top Chips coming Latest Sept 2025, with my guess, Jensen starts marketing from first half of 2025, and wider release commercially of NVDA CPU for 1st qtr of 2026, March, me thinks Jensen starts getting market ready all of 2025 for release in the wild September 2025 for retail user and full wider release by March 2026 / end of February 2026. Recap: for regular retail, end user like you and me: the latest we'll have to wait to get our hands on NVDIA designed CPU's for our end user RETAIL level laptops and pc's is Sept 2025. With ALL of 2025 being an advertisement year before the debut. Will we have actual testers with heavy hitter results as soon as first qtr of 2025? Will Jensen decide to release BEFORE Sept 2025?..

 I think all of 2025 NVDA CPU will be marketed to Kingdom come and anticipation brought to the brim, and that will be felt emotionally and in the actual stock price for this freak of nature NVDA CPU chip. Another knock out sucker punch to AMD and INTC QCOM and others. Moving into their end user market as well now. ; ) Recap: For regular end user like you and me CPU: Latest we'll have it physically in our laps in a laptop or on our desktop Sept of 2025. Meaning all of 2025 will be marketed to kingdom come before it's release in Sept 2025. And the full level CPU release by March 2026. So... yeah... AMD and INTEL have a lot to worry about. And as far as I know, Biden or Trump won't block sales of regular computer pc windows chips to China or anywhere else for that matter. :)

Imagine being the king of accelerated compute and now you have a cpu + gpu combo ARM chip that runs silent like Apple M chips and sips low power like such, but games and does AI and any heavy compute intense task very wicked like, very retail level computer chip level like that is specifically from the box ready to work with cuda and marry with existing nvidia gpu's at the hyperscaler level to even more efficiently run AI intense software and on prem (on the laptop or pc itself without cloud compute help, like QCOM snapdragon Elite PC boasts it can do(but sucks, incompatible with lots of software and games, not so with nvda).

""However, you'd think it would lean heavily on Nvidia's graphics technology. Ultimately, you'd expect it to offer the best graphics performance on the market."" DAMN STRAIGHT. 

""The implication** with this new PC chip for 2025 is that it may well (It WILL, no 'may' it will) debut a new* in-house CPU core design from Nvidia. It would certainly be far more interesting if it did. (it will)That would also enable Nvidia to offer something much more performant than Arm's own CPU core designs.""
aaand = 

""And make no mistake, the Arm instruction set allows for some very high performance CPU cores these days. By some measures, Apple's latest CPU cores in the M4 have 60% better IPC (or performance per clock cycle) than anything Intel or AMD currently offer.""

I'm not your mom. Just an OP. Read and discuss and be nice to each other. And remember to hedge like a good little boy and girl.",85,102,1731432472.0,2024-11-12T17:27:52+00:00,t3_1gpq5d8,"My views on why NVDA beats earnings and flies to higher supports. Likley past 200.  For the PE bitchers and moaners, I leave you this:

AMD Trailing Twelve Month ACTUAL PE is: 126  

NVDA Trailing Twelve Month ACTUAL PE is: 69 


Chanos bitched and moaned all the way to the broke house where he had to close shop. Tesla preaching and evangelizing the PE did him an apostate. He's done. TESLA CRUSHED HIM. Tesla easily slid into it's PE and Chanos is no more. Same thing happened with the bitchers and moaners with Amazon, Google, etc. When a company is a quality company and especially part of the SP500, where every iteration of that index HAS TO PURCHASE this stock, you ride well, and the company easily slides well into it's PE very well and snuggly like. 

Just like Zuckerberg sucker punched Open AI LLM's by making it's LLM open source and scorching the Earth, So goes NVDA: Open sourcing their DATA CENTER TECH, ( a little secret, its not just about the GPU, it's the entire package, it's not just about BLACKWELL GPU. But Rack/ Data Center Tech Design and Architecture, there will BE ZERO INCENTIVE FOR CUSTOMERS TO GO TO COMPETITORS WHEN RACK ARCHITECTURE THAT FITS BLACKWELL GPU's with ZERO ISSUE, IS COMPLETELY OUT IN THE OPEN: READ SUMMARY( this is why AMD and INTEL are having such a hard time competing and frankly anybody else, unless you're DELL and WORKING with Jensen... But Dell doesn't make chips, so their good bros and compliment each other very well in many ways, STILL NVDA HAS IT'S OWN DATA CENTER RACK TECHNOLOGY THAT IS NOT DELL'S AND IT IS NOW OPEN SOURCE- FROM COOLING TO ETHERNET AND SCALING DATA TECHNOLOGY... GIVING THEM A MASSIVE ADVANTAGE.. vs those that want to take away their Data Center Service / Business :

This OCP summit with this open sourcing debut specifically for Blackwell tech was as of last month, Oct 17th.

( Jensen is busy busy busy )  
""At this year’s OCP Global Summit, NVIDIA will be sharing key portions of the NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 system’s electro-mechanical design with the OCP community — including the rack architecture, compute and switch tray mechanicals, liquid-cooling and thermal environment specifications, and NVIDIA NVLink™ cable cartridge volumetrics—to support higher compute density and networking bandwidth.""  
..""said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “By advancing open standards, we’re helping organizations worldwide take advantage of the full potential of accelerated computing and create the AI factories of the future.”

Everybody KNOWS there is a plateau. A plateau and lower business revenues based on estimates that TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THAT INFERENCE IS LESS DEMANDING THAN TRAINING. THAT BEING SAID, MARKET IS NO LONGER LOOKING FOR INSANE NUCLEAR GROWTH. BUT STEADY HEALTHY GROWTH. THAT\*\* WILL PROPEL THIS STOCK HIGHER.

Crazy AI nuclear growth, is not what the market is expecting. Market is expecting a healthy stable growth, now that we are near equilibrium with AI and chips, ( this is obviously not true, but it's the arguments bears try to hang on. They think Amazon will overtake a 30 year CUDA industry software environment the entire world/industry has created THEIR ENTIRE INFRASTRUCTURE, BOTH SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE AROUND). Go look up CUDA. It's older than many traders here. There is no world, or dimension, in the slightest, where a newcomer, or an online retailer, will wrap up 30yrs in a qtr or two. Or three, or four... NVDA continues to climb on growth, steady healthy growth, not insane nuclear growth. THAT WILL PROPEL THIS STOCK HIGHER. It has no where else to go. Ive's and Wedbush, are ENTIRELY correct.

Dan Ives and Josh Brown Discuss NVDA  
[https://youtu.be/u-95RKiEl5o?si=8Cpbr3LFWE9WsVju](https://youtu.be/u-95RKiEl5o?si=8Cpbr3LFWE9WsVju)

Lastly NVDA will own the entire vertical from Hyperscaler to Retail Individual end user level, why? NVDA has proven that compute, it was never just a smaller and faster cpu, it was all about ACCELERATED compute with gpu architecture to get computation to the next level- why the AI revolution is here. IE Enter NVDA Retail PC / Lap Top Chips coming Latest Sept 2025, with my guess, Jensen starts marketing from first half of 2025, and wider release commercially of NVDA CPU for 1st qtr of 2026, March, me thinks Jensen starts getting market ready all of 2025 for release in the wild September 2025 for retail user and full wider release by March 2026 / end of February 2026. Recap: for regular retail, end user like you and me: the latest we'll have to wait to get our hands on NVDIA designed CPU's for our end user RETAIL level laptops and pc's is Sept 2025. With ALL of 2025 being an advertisement year before the debut. Will we have actual testers with heavy hitter results as soon as first qtr of 2025? Will Jensen decide to release BEFORE Sept 2025?..

 I think all of 2025 NVDA CPU will be marketed to Kingdom come and anticipation brought to the brim, and that will be felt emotionally and in the actual stock price for this freak of nature NVDA CPU chip. Another knock out sucker punch to AMD and INTC QCOM and others. Moving into their end user market as well now. ; ) Recap: For regular end user like you and me CPU: Latest we'll have it physically in our laps in a laptop or on our desktop Sept of 2025. Meaning all of 2025 will be marketed to kingdom come before it's release in Sept 2025. And the full level CPU release by March 2026. So... yeah... AMD and INTEL have a lot to worry about. And as far as I know, Biden or Trump won't block sales of regular computer pc windows chips to China or anywhere else for that matter. :)

Imagine being the king of accelerated compute and now you have a cpu + gpu combo ARM chip that runs silent like Apple M chips and sips low power like such, but games and does AI and any heavy compute intense task very wicked like, very retail level computer chip level like that is specifically from the box ready to work with cuda and marry with existing nvidia gpu's at the hyperscaler level to even more efficiently run AI intense software and on prem (on the laptop or pc itself without cloud compute help, like QCOM snapdragon Elite PC boasts it can do(but sucks, incompatible with lots of software and games, not so with nvda). People will hunt down a windows PC that has both* NVDA* gpu AND CPU* chips. Here is the link for more info=

""Not just that, but NVIDIA is also cooking up its new GeForce RTX 50 series ""Blackwell"" desktop graphics cards, and its new GeForce RTX 50 Laptop series ""Blackwell"" mobile GPUs, which will end up being featured inside of these new AI PCs with an NVIDIA + MediaTek CPU based on the Arm architecture.""

""NVIDIA has also previously said that RTX is the ""Premium"" AI PC platform, and that CPUs and SoCs launching with new NPUs (Neural Processing Units for AI workloads) are for ""Basic"" AI PCs. The company is right, as a decent discrete GeForce RTX GPU can blow away any NPU inside of any CPU now, and for years to come.""

""The new silicon will support advanced technologies, and will be mass-produced on TSMC's new 3nm process node, and will compete against Apple's new M4 chip, and Qualcomm's Snapdragon X processors.""

""However, you'd think it would lean heavily on Nvidia's graphics technology. Ultimately, you'd expect it to offer the best graphics performance on the market."" DAMN STRAIGHT. 

""The implication** with this new PC chip for 2025 is that it may well (It WILL, no 'may' it will) debut a new* in-house CPU core design from Nvidia. It would certainly be far more interesting if it did. (it will)That would also enable Nvidia to offer something much more performant than Arm's own CPU core designs.""
aaand = 

""And make no mistake, the Arm instruction set allows for some very high performance CPU cores these days. By some measures, Apple's latest CPU cores in the M4 have 60% better IPC (or performance per clock cycle) than anything Intel or AMD currently offer.""

226,AAPL,A Look at History: A Review of the 7 Bull Markets in U.S. Stocks Over the Past 50 Years,"Looking back at the history of U.S. stocks, all the bull and bear markets after the Great Depression, it is worthwhile for us to go like a history textbook to learn a little.
To rise 20% as the standard, the past 50 years a total of seven bull market, with the A shares of the bear long bull short different, U.S. stock history is a bull long bear short history, the following we review one by one.


1. 1970-1973:
Starting from the famous “Nifty Fifty”, the “ Pretty 50 ‘, the popular investment theme at that time was what we later knew as the ’Pretty 50”, which included a series of high-profile companies such as McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Procter &amp; Gamble, Polaroid, etc. At that time, these stocks were characterized by high earnings growth and high PEs. These companies included McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Procter &amp; Gamble, Polaroid, and a series of other high-profile companies, and at that time, these stocks were characterized by high performance growth, and at the same time, the PE was also very high. From a paper found online that specializes in the study of that time, we see that in 1972 Polaroid PE was 91 times, McDonald's was 86 times, and Coca-Cola was 48 times. Eventually, the bubble burst in 1973, when the PE of the S&amp;P 500 was 18x

2. 1974-1980:
During that period in the 70's and 80's, inflation was stronger and interest rate levels went all the way up. in 1980, inflation was as high as 13.5% and interest rates were raised to 20%, a figure that might be unimaginable today. In the midst of all this raising of interest rates along the way, this last leg of the bull market came to an end when the PE of the S&amp;P 500 was only 7.5

3. 1982-1987:
Another new cycle began, inflation was curbed, interest rates began a long downward spiral that continues to this day, and with various tax cuts, a new bull market was up. The five-year bull market lasted until Black Monday in 1987, when the broad market fell 22% in one day. In fact, the PE of the broad market at that time was not too high, 15 times PE. This crash was rather sudden, and there are also claims that the computerized trading model introduced at that time led to this rapid plunge. However, since then, the meltdown mechanism has been invented

4. 1987-1990:
The selloff brought on by Black Monday was quickly followed by a rally, a rallying bull of sorts as the broader market accumulated a 65% gain by 1990. By 1990, interest rates once again stayed high because of the rising oil prices at the time, and the 10% interest rate level was never seen again for 30 years after that. At that time, the broad market PE was 15 times, which was not too high, and the index decline lasted only three months before it was over

5. 1990-2000：
The 90's were good and beautiful, and the 10-year-long bull market was about to kick off. This decade the U.S. economy is good, Windows95, Windows98, Yahoo, the Internet has brought unlimited imagination, the feeling is not immediately into the new century, but into the new world. Ten years, the general market rose more than 4 times, are epic. Eventually the internet bubble bubbled, Amazon went from a high of 100 bucks, down to a few bucks, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 50% of its value

6. 2002-2007:
The low interest rate level and zero down payment to buy a house, if you are interested, you can go and watch the movie “The Big Short” again, which describes it in a very easy-to-understand way. You can buy a house with no money, and when you do, home prices go up, and you feel happier to spend money when you have money, and the guys get high. Wall Street has repackaged these subprime zero-down mortgages into a product that is complicated for everyone to understand, but looks like an oxymoron, so how can you not make money? The farce had to end, and it did, with the 2008 subprime crisis, which left 8 million people unemployed, 6 million homeless, and the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression in the U.S. Between 2007 and 2009, the S&amp;P 500 lost nearly 60% of its value, Citibank lost 97% of its market capitalization, and Lehman Brothers went bankrupt.

7. 2009-Present:
After the subprime mortgage crisis cleared up, U.S. stocks had one of the longest bull markets in history. It was also an era when large U.S. technology companies became stock market leaders. more than a decade after the release of the iPhone in 2007, Apple became the world's largest company by market capitalization. Microsoft, which had almost been forgotten, returned to the top of its market capitalization after transforming itself into cloud computing. And then there's Amazon, left over from the last Internet bubble, and Google, the Google created during the last Internet bubble, have grown to become giants with market capitalizations of over $2 trillion dollars

232,AAPL,Trimming Appl before Berkshire results tomorrow ,"Investors may want to consider trimming their Apple (AAPL) positions based on recent developments and upcoming events. Here's why:

## Apple's Recent Performance

Apple's latest earnings report has raised some concerns among investors. The company reported a decline in global iPhone sales for the second consecutive quarter, partly due to increased competition in China from companies like Huawei[3]. This slowdown in Apple's flagship product could signal challenges ahead for the tech giant.

## Berkshire Hathaway's Significant Reduction

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) has made a notable move by cutting its stake in Apple by nearly 50% during the second quarter of 2024[1][2]. This reduction came after Berkshire had already trimmed its Apple holdings by 13% in the first quarter[1]. Such a significant divestment by a long-term, value-focused investor like Buffett could be interpreted as a cautionary signal.

## Potential for Further Trimming

With Berkshire Hathaway set to report earnings tomorrow, investors should pay close attention. Apple's stock price has risen by approximately $15 since the end of September when Berkshire made its substantial cut. This increase, coupled with Berkshire's recent selling pattern, suggests that another trim in Berkshire's Apple holdings is possible[4].

## Broader Market Considerations

Berkshire's actions may reflect broader concerns about the U.S. economy. The company has increased its cash reserves to a record $277 billion, which could indicate a more cautious outlook on equities in general[5]. This substantial cash position might be seen as a hedge against potential market volatility or economic uncertainty.

## Investor Takeaway

While Apple remains a strong company with significant market presence, these factors combined suggest that investors might want to reassess their positions:

1. Apple's slowing iPhone sales and increased competition
2. Berkshire's substantial reduction in Apple holdings
3. The possibility of further trimming by Berkshire
4. Overall market and economic uncertainties

Given that the onions for appl options will be down after earnings, this would be an excellent time to short appl. This is not financial advice.

check out this guy's video. he is deeply close with Apple. He a suck-up total apple dickrider. has visited the campus and done multiple interviews with execs. It must be an open secret on the inside because he knew. He just had this slip where he introduces John Ternus as ""c- svp of hardware engineering"" at the 00:16 minute mark. And then Ternus catches the almost slip, and smiles.

He then uploads the unedited clip anyway. If apple wanted to keep it airtight they would make him edit that part out before uploading. It's him.

241,AAPL,5600% Gains with Options,"Been investing with bi-weekly every time i received my paycheck for the last 5 years. Was just DCA'ing with no care about prices.

Studied options and did paper trading for about 1.5years. Was able to turn 10k into 45k after a year with fake money.

Decided to do options this year in my non-registered account around May. Started with $1000, and was doing 0dte calls and puts on NVDA and brought it to about $2400. Then got screwed by the Israel/iran war thinking oil was going to moon by full porting into oil stocks and there was a ceasefire immediately and my shit crashed hard. I was down to $400 and i almost said screw it options are not for me. Told myself to go again, but not to invest with emotion or get into hype. Used that as my first lesson to not fomo or trade around the news or hype, market is irrational.

I then put another $1700 in my non-registered account over June and July and made some leaps. Googl, AMD, NVDA,, NBIS, IREN, BABA, bidu, Amzn, MU, UNH and was doing Tesla puts and calls for weeks in August-September cause it kept going up and down every week like clockwork. I did have a leap on Tesla that i had which i sold after it broke above 400. My account slowly grew, i took profits too early on google when it first broke 207 as well as MU, and missed out on so much gains before jumping back in at 230 with Googl. Got really lucky with AMD as i had about 20k of leaps (10 contracts) i first bought when it dipped below 160 and DCA'd up in August and held until it hit 212. Sold 7 of my contracts and still holding the other 3.

I also bag held so many of these for months without paper handing. For example Oct 10, and this whole last week really tested my nerves, but had to take a step back and stick with my conviction and price targets. I knew it was temporary. Shit might dip again and this might just be a bull trap, but fuck it yolo. Get rich or die trying. I'm likely closing most of my positions by end of this month/beginning of December or once this account gets to $200k (whichever is sooner).

Every time i sold a position, i used that money to reinvest mostly in AMD and NVDA calls/leaps. UNH i had to close some of my positions at a loss but overall it was net profits with my UNH leaps. It just sucks cause i was up so much before Oct 28 and had so many calls in UNH :(

I know i am incredibly lucky

  
\*EDIT: A lot of people asked me where i paper traded. I used trading view and investopedia.

Was just DCA'ing with no care about prices.

Studied options and did paper trading for about 1.5years. Was able to turn 10k into 45k after a year with fake money.

Decided to do options this year in my non-registered account around May. Started with $1000, and was doing 0dte calls and puts on NVDA and brought it to about $2400. Then got screwed by the Israel/iran war thinking oil was going to moon by full porting into oil stocks and there was a ceasefire immediately and my shit crashed hard. I was down to $400 and i almost said screw it options are not for me. Told myself to go again, but not to invest with emotion or get into hype. Used that as my first lesson to not fomo or trade around the news or hype, market is irrational.

I then put another $1700 in my non-registered account over June and July and made some leaps. Googl, AMD, NVDA,, NBIS, IREN, BABA, bidu, Amzn, MU, UNH and was doing Tesla puts and calls for weeks in August-September cause it kept going up and down every week like clockwork. I did have a leap on Tesla that i had which i sold after it broke above 400. My account slowly grew, i took profits too early on google when it first broke 207 as well as MU, and missed out on so much gains before jumping back in at 230 with Googl. Got really lucky with AMD as i had about 20k of leaps (10 contracts) i first bought when it dipped below 160 and DCA'd up in August and held until it hit 212. Sold 7 of my contracts and still holding the other 3.

243,AAPL,Why the bubble narrative is a generational GOOG buying opportunity,"Have gotten 20+ messages asking me if / when I plan to sell my GOOG LEAP position. So sharing my thoughts here:

You basically can’t go 20 seconds without hearing someone mention the tech / AI bubble these days. It’s completely unavoidable and is shaping how people invest more than you may realize. But here’s why I think this narrative is actually creating a generational buying opportunity for a few companies.

People are conflating the AI bubble and the massive growth of the Mag 6. But fail to acknowledge that, barring Nvidia, the Mag 6 growth is almost 100% due to non-LLM based bottom line growth. These monopolies are putting up Jokic numbers that justify these valuations.

This brings us to Google, one of the most oversold stocks in the entire market (until very recently). After reporting a record breaking 100M revenue quarter, and beating EPS expectations by over 30%, GOOG stayed completely flat. Touted as part of the “frothy and way overbought” Mag 7, GOOG’s PE ratio of 27.91 is LOWER THAN SPY’s PE of 28.89.

Let me repeat that for you:

One of the three companies that can manufacture cutting edge AI chips at scale, the HIGHEST NET PROFIT COMPANY ON THE PLANET, that grew every part of its business double digits YoY, has a lower PE ratio than:

-Walmart
-Caterpillar
-Costco
-Nike
-Hilton
-Pepsi


Talk about overvaluation. I’d argue the rest of SPY is more bubbly, as they are being bought via Index funds en masse due to MAG 7 gains, but aren’t being shorted like the MAG 7 are because that doesn’t fit the narrative.


The way I see it, even if we are in a bubble, google does not depend on AI contracts dated 1-4 years out in the way that other players in the space do, as they consume the lions share of their own compute with their money printing businesses.


And if we aren’t in a bubble, and those who control AI control the world, then google is probably the best positioned company out there. They have the strongest AI talent, have several already vetted AI business (Isomorphic labs, Waymo, Search, Shorts), own the entire AI stack: applications, models, chips, data centers (they have 10+ yoe building massive TPU data-centers on time).


The absurd undervaluation compared to its peers (AMZN, MSFT, AAPL, NVDA) won’t last forever. Given google is the most profitable business in the world, either the rest of the Mag 6 need to show growth rates significantly higher than google’s absurd pace to justify the 30-40% premium, or GOOG will need to show signs of slowing down. But that’s not what we’re seeing today, and I’m tired of pretending that GOOGL is at all “overvalued” due to the AI bubble.  it’s arguably the other way around.

309,AAPL,TSLA keeps trading like a leveraged S&amp;P 500 ETF,"Since TSLA's disastrous earnings last week, a lot of people have asked how the stock manages to be up in spite of it all. And *part* of the reason is probably that Musk managed to get away with promising to cut his involvement with DOGE back to 1-2 days per week and have this reported as ""Musk stepping back from DOGE"", as if the effects of taking a chainsaw to your own brand were linear with number of hours per week spent doing it.

But I think a lot of the reason TSLA managed to have a run of good trading days in spite of terrible earnings is that on those days, the S&amp;P 500 was up, and TSLA seems to spend a lot of time trading like a leveraged S&amp;P 500 ETF.

I had a vague, intuitive sense of this, but I wanted to put some numbers on it. There've been 68 trading day's since Trump's inauguration (not counting the currently ongoing trading day). On 26 of those days, TSLA and the S&amp;P 500 were both down. On 22 of those days, TSLA and the S&amp;P 500 were both up. And there were 14 days where the S&amp;P 500 was up while TSLA was down, but only 6 days where TSLA was up while the S&amp;P 500 was down.

So the first thing to notice here is there's a bit of an asymmetry—on days when the S&amp;P 500 was up, TSLA was up a little more than 60% of the time, whereas on days when the S&amp;P 500 was down, TSLA was down more than 80% of the time.

The other thing is the magnitude of the swings. On days both TSLA and the S&amp;P 500 were up, TSLA was up more in all but two cases. But on days when TSLA and the S&amp;P 500 were both down, TSLA was down more in *every single case.* A linear regression of TSLA's price movements and the S&amp;P 500's gives you a slope of about 2.14, meaning that on average (and I must emphasize this is an average), if the S&amp;P moves by 1%, TSLA can be expected to move by more than 2%.

What's going on here? Well, first of all, TSLA should have very little ability to push around the S&amp;P 500 by itself. It may be a ""megacap"" fund, but its weight in the S&amp;P 500 is less than 2%, and even AAPL is less than 7%. On the other hand, S&amp;P 500 index funds probably push around TSLA a lot—inflows and outflows into index funds, whether traditional mutual funds or ETFs, result in buying and selling of the components, affecting their price. That's how index funds are *supposed* to work.

The real question is why the changes are consistently amplified. Part of the story is probably that TSLA has a high P/E ratio, and companies with high P/E ratios are just in general more sensitive to market trends (something you can see if you compare the implied volatility on growth ETFs to the implied volatility on value ETFs). I do wonder if there's an additional factor, that TSLA has been in the news a lot, contributing to its volatility, which then becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy because volatility attracts gamblers and because quants build the observed volatility into their models.

An important upshot of this: even though I am not kidding when I say I [expect SPY to go to 420](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ji8bie/spy_to_420/), I've never bought SPY puts, because I expect that *real* pain from the China tariffs hits in a few weeks, TSLA will crash even harder than the broad market. There are probably other stocks you could make this play with, though I don't have a specific one I really like. (Notably, I recently opened a short position on PLTR, then thought better of it and closed the position at a small loss after deciding their bull case was significantly less implausible than TSLA's.)

EDIT: I'm a dumbass. TSLA is a high-beta stock. I've known about CAPM for years but always hear about it in the context of people wanting *low*\-beta investments, which is probably why I blanked on applying it to TSLA.

***The Play TLDR***; *Short tech (QQQ puts, SPY puts, SOXL puts)*  


On April 2nd, we will (allegedly) learn what Donald Trump's plan will be for ""rolling back unfair trade practices that have been ripping off America"". Currently, analysts are primarily focused on illustrating the impacts of these tariffs on commodities and industrials. Understandably, since these asset classes are most commonly included in U.S. top export metrics:

***THE POINT:***

  
In 1998, the World Trade Organization (WTO) temporarily banned tariffs on a class of assets called ""electronic transmissions"" (digital goods). This decision was made due to the rapid and unparalleled emergence of a new medium of information exchange called **the ""internet"".**

  
This ban prevented members from charging tariffs on goods provided electronically over the web. This temporary ban has been reviewed every two years by member countries, with the outcome being that it is mutually beneficial to keep the moratorium in place.  
This moratorium has played a ***critical*** role in U.S. tech's profitability:



[Current framework of free digital trade](https://preview.redd.it/sfyu2o6gp4se1.jpg?width=768&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4025959602f933ad83942912a6ffadfda84f97b)

In the example above, a company providing digital goods/services can trade freely with other countries. Digital transactions are not treated like physical goods transported internationally, where the goods must be declared at customs and taxes paid on their value.

  
This framework has been deemed to be in the best interest of the world for **decades**, and all political parties have managed to put aside their differences to ensure this framework's survival for the greater good. However, ***Trump's current economic offensive has put this framework at risk when/if other countries decide to ""strike back"":***  


[Framework for digital trade under tariffs](https://preview.redd.it/8ty1db2sp4se1.jpg?width=768&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c14880088e780e48b6796d64f5295d40e572fd0c)

***THE PROBLEM:***

Nearly [$270B or 70% of U.S. ""services"" exports](https://project-disco.org/21st-century-trade/new-government-data-shows-digital-services-exports-continue-to-drive-u-s-trade/) come from digital goods. Referring to the first picture of this post, this is roughly $62B more than the current top U.S. tangible goods export (Cars/Car parts (implied)). 

The problem, then, is derived from the following:

[\&gt;50&amp;#37; of the revenue of the S&amp;P 500 IT sectors comes from foreign countries](https://preview.redd.it/7oxbsiqis4se1.png?width=520&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c978c1b69a7f9b22ee05f14060974c87508e801)

NVDA, GOOG, META, AAPL, and other tech stocks would incur significant losses from the termination of the 1998 e-commerce moratorium.

***The Endgame:*** 

The tariffs proposed by the Trump administration will **invalidate** the 1998 WTO moratorium agreement **-&gt;** Foreign governments looking to push back against the U.S. tariffs will target U.S. tech and digital goods/services **-&gt;** U.S. tech margins will contract, as they are forced to account for taxes/tariffs on services provided internationally (i.e. Netflix pays tariffs on shows streamed by consumers in Europe) **-&gt;** U.S. economy will enter a recession due to the concentration of the top 10% of wealth (locked in the stock market) compromising \~50% of all U.S. spending

This means that someone who started their job on the first day of 2021 (assuming equity deposits, etc. happened the same way, they don't but just imagine), they should have gone to META and not AMZN.

Surprisingly GOOGL turned out to be the best bet in terms of volatility and performance. I can imagine META employees dumping their stock and not holding, GOOGL employees usually do auto sale, but the ones who kept it and didn't sell probably did well.

351,AAPL,$GOOG the BFTG,"
Regards, grab your tendies and gather around the fire because I’m going to tell you all about *$GOOG* (aka Alphabet) the BFTG (Big Fucking ~~Tech~~ Tendie Giant). I’ll break it down for you because I know you polish that 🧠 real nice so I can’t expect a single wrinkle. 

1. Criminally Low P/E Ratio

While all your other tech darlings are flexing P/E ratios like a hooker in heat, $GOOGL is at 23.4 P/E ratio.

For reference:
* $SPX: &gt;27 P/E (yes, the S&amp;P500)
* $MSFT: &gt;36 P/E
* $AAPL: &gt;39 P/E
* $NVDA: &gt;56 P/E
* $AMZN: &gt;47 P/E
* $TSLA: &gt;106 P/E (Fuck you, for the window lickers in the back)

Remember a “good” P/E ratio is traditionally around 20-25. If you don’t understand then read a fucking book.

2. AI Incumming

Sure, everyone’s talking about OpenAI and ChatGPT, but who’s making real money here? Google owns 90%+ of search traffic (when did you ever hear “yahoo it” or “ask duck duck go”?) and monetizes it like a legal cartel. Once Gemini (+Legacy Bard) gets some improvements and a little lipstick even MORE money. Oh, and don’t forget Google Cloud, which grew revenues 30% YoY last quarter.

3. Santa Rally - Ho Ho Hold Onto Your Bollocks 🎅

Historically, December is green season for big-cap tech. Funds rebalance, and retail apes are YOLOing. The Santa Rally isn’t just a meme; it’s a statistical goldmine. With $GOOG’s recent earnings beat ($28.5B in 3 months), the market’s about to price this in as snow starts falling.

4. Big Tech = Safe Haven

Recession? Inflation? Global chaos? Who cares. Big Tech don’t give a *FUCK*. Ad spending may wobble, but companies will NEVER stop buying Google ads.

5. Buybacks on Steroids

$GOOGL has a $70 BILLION buyback program active, the best part? They’re buying low and will push us even higher.

TL;DR: Google Is The Perfect Combo of Value &amp; Growth.

Not financial advice. YOLO as your own risk. I’ll be adding more in two weeks having sold ESPP shares to raise more fire power.

How the fuck do I add a ban-bet? If I’m going to do this properly I might as well add some sauce.

Regards, grab your tendies and gather around the fire because I’m going to tell you all about *$GOOG* (aka Alphabet) the BFTG (Big Fucking ~~Tech~~ Tendie Giant). I’ll break it down for you because I know you polish that 🧠 real nice so I can’t expect a single wrinkle. 

1. Criminally Low P/E Ratio

While all your other tech darlings are flexing P/E ratios like a hooker in heat, $GOOGL is at 23.4 P/E ratio.

For reference:
* $SPX: &gt;27 P/E (yes, the S&amp;P500)
* $MSFT: &gt;36 P/E
* $AAPL: &gt;39 P/E
* $NVDA: &gt;56 P/E
* $AMZN: &gt;47 P/E
* $TSLA: &gt;106 P/E (Fuck you, for the window lickers in the back)

Remember a “good” P/E ratio is traditionally around 20-25. If you don’t understand then read a fucking book.

2. AI Incumming

Sure, everyone’s talking about OpenAI and ChatGPT, but who’s making real money here? Google owns 90%+ of search traffic (when did you ever hear “yahoo it” or “ask duck duck go”?) and monetizes it like a legal cartel. Once Gemini (+Legacy Bard) gets some improvements and a little lipstick even MORE money. Oh, and don’t forget Google Cloud, which grew revenues 30% YoY last quarter.

3. Santa Rally - Ho Ho Hold Onto Your Bollocks 🎅

Historically, December is green season for big-cap tech. Funds rebalance, and retail apes are YOLOing. The Santa Rally isn’t just a meme; it’s a statistical goldmine. With $GOOG’s recent earnings beat ($28.5B in 3 months), the market’s about to price this in as snow starts falling.

4. Big Tech = Safe Haven

Recession? Inflation? Global chaos? Who cares. Big Tech don’t give a *FUCK*. Ad spending may wobble, but companies will NEVER stop buying Google ads.

5. Buybacks on Steroids

$GOOGL has a $70 BILLION buyback program active, the best part? They’re buying low and will push us even higher.

TL;DR: Google Is The Perfect Combo of Value &amp; Growth.

Today I got 2 earnings plays for y'all: **Crocs** and **PayPal**, both reporting tomorrow before the open. I also have 2 bonus lotto plays on 2 no-name trash companies that report today after the bell; they’ll be in the TLDR at the bottom.

1. **CROX** \- In my last post, I opened a long position on DECK since I noticed a big trend with Uggs all over social media, and it paid off. Now I'm seeing the same thing with Crocs. People don’t care that they look like shit anymore; they think it's fashion now. You know those charms you put in the holes of Crocs? Every kid wants them these days. They don’t realize you can get the exact same charms from China for 5% of the price. That’s what I did, and I’ve been rocking the same Crocs for 6 years now. Those crocodiles know how to make shoes man...... Also McDonalds put mini Crocs toys in their happy meals. Expect green dildos.
2. **PYPL -** PayPal is notorious for having big expectations but then underdelivering. Mfs are trading at a 52W high right now, really poised for a big correction. Apple pay, Google pay, Adyen, Stripe, Square—they're all getting a slice of the cake now. Intel nana is praying for PayPal's downfall. Do not be surprised if this stock goes tits up.

TL;DR - Dad got cancer - so I went ham on investing 

I've been a long time lurker of this sub (and I never really post on reddit in general), but I didn't know where else to post this. I don't do options so maybe this is the wrong place lmao.

I moved back home to my parents place when my dad was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer. Truthfully this has been the worst year of my life (and his obviously) in a lot of ways, but I've been investing since I was 16 (I'm 25 now). My dad worked in equities, so when he lost his ability to communicate effectively with me (and since I had significantly more income because I'm not paying rent) - I truthfully went ballistic on investing.

Pretty much said fuck it, I'm living at home I don't need a 6 month emergency fund till I move out and went all-in. Granted 40% of my portfolio not listed here is in a 401k account entirely in the S&amp;P 500 (set &amp; forget just in case my equities went to hell as with the rest of my life lol).

I believe in the margin of safety when investing. I like to invest in high-quality companies that generate lots of cash as the backbone of my portfolio. Since 2021 (before my dad got this cancer shit), I spoke with him and he basically said just look at the fundamentals of a company and invest in growth companies that you think will be around in 5-10 years. I look for value within growth stocks (i know paradoxical). Some of my icons in investing are David Tepper &amp; Michael Burry. Again below is all my own experience and reflects **only** my own views and are not a recommendation of my company (corporate. disclaimer).

* My portfolio is heavily weighted (85%) between several stocks: AAPL, META, MSFT, GOOGL (So fucking cheap r u kidding me sorry), NVDA, AMZN, AMD, CRM, COST, RIVN (RIP), AVGO, VOO (ik not a stock) &lt;-- I know semi(s) are very cyclical but i believe in holding all of these companies for 5-10 years, so I don't have to worry about temp. earnings beats/misses etc. Much easier to pick a stock and hold it for a while then it is to get the timing right. Roughly at 175% return in the past 3 years. (hammered META at $100's, NVDA at $200 both in 2022)
* Roughly 15% of my bets are moonshots (note the word bet hehe) with promise but objectively could be overvalued/bad investments: CCL/RCL (both are crushing it and between them own 75% of the cruise line market), LCID/RIVN (going to 0 bc they can't scale profitably or will make u a very happy person 3 years down the line bc R2/Atlas at 45k/50k should capture a significant portion of model y demand), TTD, DKNG/FLUT - gambling hasn't even been legalized in Cali/Texas (the biggest markets in the U.S. come on), RBLX (feels like betting against youtube in the early innings w/o realizing how much rev. they're actually recognizing), PYPL (value - cheap af (bought at $60) should turn around in a couple years)

I joke I allocate like google's budget where it's 90% bread&amp;butter and the rest are moonshots.

Was very depressed (still reasonably depressed) because I'm not sure how much time my dad has. I hope in a way I can pass some of these stocks to my kid in a better place than I found it. I don't know I'm crying as I write this. Fuck my life. It is what it is.

370,AAPL,baby’s first year trading options with prideful 250%+ YTD - AMA or roast me.,"This got removed in options for being too noob so here I am with you fellow regards.

I started trading options in March and smashed my previous ATH this week 🎉 
I’ll summarize the last 6-12 months:
For most of 2022-2023 across three accounts, both taxable and IRAs, I had been middling around 15k and not doing very well trading. In the last 6 months since I started options, I’m up over 125% with only about $200 a month deposited. I’m also up 250% YTD and 340% the past 12 months, but those include a max Roth IRA $6500 contribution. It was a pretty good time to start playing semi/AI tech, and then space startups, but of course I wish I got in sooner! 

My biggest successes have been with AAPL, TSM, and NVDA of course, then ASTS, RKLB, LUNR. 
Lost on SOFI and DKNG while getting my feet wet, then played a series of TSM calls for big wins. I needed those wins to afford any NVDA options 😂 
Had another big loss with MU, some on HIMS (I hate the stock). Have a little in OKLO shares but super pissed I didn’t grab some calls in the last few months.

*I’ll post more in comments if people ask.* I did not have a disciplined strategy, just some loose principles putting guardrails on my emotional gambling mindset (vibe check sigma grindset). I think I got slightly past the “first run is free” phase and now I can clearly see I am the next Buffett.

371,AAPL,"When will ""investor"" delusion end?","I'm new, please don't bully me, I have no clue what is going on which is why I use really basic concepts in my explanation.

Growth Investment vs. Value Investment.  

One one hand, there are growth stocks; Wall Street currently is in overdrive, investors are hyper-optimistic and companies like tickers: TSMC and NVDA are trading far above their average P/E ratios, these types of companies are called growth stocks because investors are betting that in the future, their “valuations” will be justified by NVDA’s performance, instead of investing in intrinsic value, shareholders are investing in the IMPLICIT VALUE of a company, which is what they perceive the future intrinsic value of a company will be. 

When the economy is doing well (as it is now, kinda, I think), growth stocks do well; this is because demand for goods and services goes up, interest rates go down, revenues for businesses go up, borrowing is cheaper and technology companies like NVDA can capitalize off of that to fund R&amp;D, growing the scale of operations and benefitting from economies of scale, justifying the IMPLICIT VALUATIONS, raising stock prices to the stratosphere. 

On the other hand, when the economy is receding as part of its natural cycle, the economy gets a “reality check”, investors realize that their growth valuations were too optimistic and that their predictions won’t mature soon enough to achieve their desired ROI per annum. As a result, they flock to value investments because they realize that companies like Bank of America are resilient, undervalued and going to grow in a high-interest environment which we could be looking at in December. 

The same thing happens in a bubble, and it is no secret that AI is a bubble as of now considering the ludicrous difference in implicit and intrinsic valuations. 

Looking at NVDA, it is easy to see how we could be looking at the first half of a repeat of the 3D Printing bubble in 2014.  

That is not to say that, 3D printing is akin to AI, however, it is almost guaranteed that NVDA fill be facing a significant correction (like AAPL did in December 2022 and December 2023) after a rally due to the incoming CPI data (unlike AAPL). 

We are too late to invest in growth stocks and too early to buy value stocks, so we are faced with a dilemma: 



How can we invest on the tipping point of the economy’s growth? 

To be honest, I have no fucking clue, however, with CPI data coming 8:00 E.T, that could change: if CPI is significantly higher than before, a world of high interest rate December will become much more visible, if it is significantly lower, then we will see a big rally for companies like NVDA. Anything in between a clear-cut CPI , will just muddy the waters as the stock market is rife with AI speculative delusion. 

What is certain, however, is that NVDA, sooner or later, will get a really painful reality check, and if you don’t believe me, you shouldn't, because I don't know what I'm yapping about.

What is going to happen? Are my puts fucked?

384,AAPL,AAPL vs. NVDA Comps,"I consider AAPL a good reference point for NVDA considering there aren’t many companies with market caps so high.

For the last quarter, AAPL’s revenue was **85.78B** compared to **30.04B** for NVDA. But of course their margins are different - AAPL’s is close to **25%**, while NVDA’s is close to **50%**. That’s how we get net income in the last quarter of **21.45B** for AAPL and **16.6B** for NVDA. All else equal then, NVDA’s value should be about 77.39% of AAPL’s. Looking at today’s market caps we have AAPL at **3.383T** and NVDA at **2.649T**, which puts NVDA’s value at 78.30% of AAPL’s, or roughly 1.3% overvalued based on net income alone. 

But of course all else is not equal. As you know, a company’s valuation is based upon future earnings, not past. When we look at the past quarter, we see that AAPL’s net income **declined 9.26%** from the previous quarter, while NVDA’s **increased by 11.56**%. Even if Apr-Jun is typically a low quarter for AAPL, looking at year over year change in net income, shows us **7.88%** growth for AAPL compared to **168.24%** for NVDA.

Why then does NVDA have only a one percent premium over AAPL based upon net income, when NVDA’s net income grew 46.7% more in the past quarter than AAPL’s did in the past year?

This is not a ""copium"" post about the recent stock price drops.

I am a 3rd world country regard who is a Software Engineer and I will share my insights into the industry with my broken ass English, if you want to join me on this journey, be my guest.

The problem with NVDA is that they are ""overhyped"" not ""overpriced"". Some of you regards might say that ""OH THEIR STOCK PRICE INCREASED 150% YOY HOW IS THAT NOT OVERPRICED"", I will kindly ask you to check their income growth, which sits at 122% YOY.

First of all, lets compare some other tech giants earnings to NVDA earnings to see what they are ""worth now"".

|Name|Stock price|EPS|SP/EPS ratio|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|AAPL|230|1,4|164|
|MSFT|413|2,95|140|
|AMD|145|0,16|1.035|
|META|516|5,16|100|
|AMZN|171|1,26|135|
|NVDA|116|0,68|170|

As you can see above, they are not overpriced related to their current earnings. And I think that them going back to 110 will set them good for later improvements. But them getting hyped beyond recognition was the sole reason for them being priced at 130 per price.

But before jumping into the NVDA analysis, lets go over every single tech stock in that list.

## AAPL

Latest thing they achieved was M1 chip, converting old and worthless Macbook Pro hardware into a performing machine with great battery life. This was also accompanied by the fact that they can charge a premium for small hardware upgrades (200$ for a simple 256GB storage?), which helped them to sell new computers to their old customers and gain huge profits.

How do I know this? Because after 2021, when M1 chip proved to be powerful and resourceful, most of our Macbook stack got renewed. I was using a 6 years old work Macbook before that, because newer Intel Macbooks did not promise anything new.

But this was 3 years ago. Now, they are pretty much failing to create new income markets. Their latest tech demo ""Vision Pro"" failed miserably. Their only means to increase their income is to sell more hardware to push their services (AppStore and stuff), but this is also under investigation and they probably will have to open up their ecosystem more.

## MSFT

They did suck tits before Nadella became a CEO. They tried to be a ""everything"" company but everything they did suck. Then Nadella came and transformed the rotting corpse of MSFT on the Golden Throne into the Cloud giant they are.

They are platformless. Their services are used everywhere. They are bringing Windows into ARM devices (again) and it does not suck this time. New ARM platform seems to outperform M series Macbooks in battery performance, which will end years of Macbook supremacy.

They are agile. They set and integrate trends easier. Game Pass? Azure? Cloud Office?

## AMD

I am a fellow AMD user (7900XTX gang?) and oh boy they are at least a few years behind in datacenter solutions. Also given their driver problem history on Desktop, power draw problems and other bugs, they need more resources to fix their problems first.

Also, sadly, they do not have CUDA. Personally, I am training some neural networks on my 7900XTX and it is 5 to 10 times faster than my CPU but also 5 to 10 times slower than NVDA counterpart. And also, I have to put in the extra work to find that specific framework that works with AMD and make the very specific adjustments before even I can start using the hardware.

Even if their hardware can match NVDA, it is like having a really fast fighter jet without any software assistance, yeah you can MAYBE safely take off if you work hard enough, but you will never win against the jest with a strong software.

And no one is buying their data center products (Other than their CPU's). I will get on this in NVDA's section.

## META

They are a ""AD"" company, just like Google. They have some ""long game"" products (Metaverse and Google Self Driving as much as you joke them), but they are far from ALPHA phase. If they can show the world that this is the future, they might get a 60% to 90% increase in their value.

ALSO THEY ARE BUYING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF WORTH NVDA PRODUCTS.

## AMZN

The ""everything company"". They are big. But not as much profitable as the rest. For me, their biggest product is AWS. If they can create a new income source they will be the next 3T company, may be even earlier than GOOGL.

# NVDA

AND OUR STAR CHILD.
HOT TOPIC OF 2024.
THE FUTURE OF THE WORLD.

Do you remember when they wanted to acquire ARM? This was back in 2020, when their market cap was around 145 BILLION. Do you know how much they were willing to spend on ARM? 40 BILLION DOLLARS. This was before the AI craze and boom in their revenue.

So why did NVDA wanted to acquire ARM? For their CPU's of course. They are going to create the Apple way of Datacenters. Soft spot of H100 series was their lack of integration between CPU and GPU. Blackwell aims to solve this. Finally, they are creating a whole SOC, with their new CPU, Grace.

Remember what I told you in AAPL's section? The way their tight integration of M series chips with rest of the system made their profits skyrocket? Do you see what will Blackwell do for NVDA now?

H100 users will have a clear path to upgrade, and with their newest technology, they will get MORE OF THE PIE on the single server rack. If NVDA made X thousand dollars of profits from a single server rack from H100 users, this will definitely go beyond 4X mark with Blackwell.

And I previously mentioned no one was buying AMD. This was because in our company, we have bought A MILLION DOLLARS worth of NVDA datacenter products. There was a discussion in our team, if we should buy AMD datacenter GPU's because it was WAY cheaper, I mean 4-5 times cheaper. Everyone disagreed and we went with the NVDA GPU and AMD CPU, and we are just one team in a huge company.

Remember when I told you I was a THIRD WORLD REGARD? Yeah. NVDA technologies are just spreading to this part of the world. Even we are spending MILLIONS of dollars for NVDA. And we are just starting to build up our NVDA datacenters. What do you think in 5 years, when it is time to upgrade, do you think that we will switch our provider and ditch all the work? Or do you think that we will go with NVDA and make them rich?

Let the bears win some battles, so NVDA can win the war.

So why did NVDA wanted to acquire ARM? For their CPU's of course. They are going to create the Apple way of Datacenters. Soft spot of H100 series was their lack of integration between CPU and GPU. Blackwell aims to solve this. Finally, they are creating a whole SOC, with their new CPU, Grace.

Remember what I told you in AAPL's section? The way their tight integration of M series chips with rest of the system made their profits skyrocket? Do you see what will Blackwell do for NVDA now?

H100 users will have a clear path to upgrade, and with their newest technology, they will get MORE OF THE PIE on the single server rack. If NVDA made X thousand dollars of profits from a single server rack from H100 users, this will definitely go beyond 4X mark with Blackwell.

And I previously mentioned no one was buying AMD. This was because in our company, we have bought A MILLION DOLLARS worth of NVDA datacenter products. There was a discussion in our team, if we should buy AMD datacenter GPU's because it was WAY cheaper, I mean 4-5 times cheaper. Everyone disagreed and we went with the NVDA GPU and AMD CPU, and we are just one team in a huge company.

Remember when I told you I was a THIRD WORLD REGARD? Yeah. NVDA technologies are just spreading to this part of the world. Even we are spending MILLIONS of dollars for NVDA. And we are just starting to build up our NVDA datacenters. What do you think in 5 years, when it is time to upgrade, do you think that we will switch our provider and ditch all the work? Or do you think that we will go with NVDA and make them rich?

Let the bears win some battles, so NVDA can win the war.

389,AAPL,"The next tech giant. Why $HOOD, $PLTR and $DKNG are the investment opportunities of a lifetime. (Part 1)","I believe the story of the last 20 years of stock market is that one tech startup can disrupt an entire sector and join the tech giant club. For many sectors, information is king and turns out a company with a few 1000 people who have studied the science of information can outperform millions of people who aren't so scientifically rigorous. Now some sectors are not so prone to be disrupted by these information science experts. And if you asked me 20 years ago which sectors will be disrupted in what order, I would've guessed wrong.

$AMZN Turns out the value of millions of retail stores across the west was not in their inventory, their brand or their location. Amazon proved their value was in knowing who wants what item when and where. Information. How can millions of retail shop compete with amazon when they already have my payment information (how) my location (where) and all amazon has to figure out is what do I want, which I'm happy to tell them by typing one word or expression in a search bar instead of walking around Home Depot trying to find a employee who's not too busy and has every reason to avoid me. Sentences and social interactions just can't compete with 1s and 0s. Now I wish I figured this all out 20 years ago when amazon still a great investment opportunity, but how could I have known Jeff would overcome all the hurdles by building this impossible network of warehouses and delivery. I won't make the same mistake twice.

$NFLX (movies). $SPOT (music) $GOOG,$META(ads, communication, media), $AAPL, $MSFT etc... These are 100% information sectors that I would've guessed would be disrupted. But these were winner takes all. How could I know Facebook wouldn't fail like MySpace and Friendster? That iphones would be better than blackberry and nokia? How could I know Yahoo would become a total failure when they had such a commanding lead in the early internet era. These stocks will keep going up but they're not the 100 baggers they once were.

And so in true wsb fashion, the question becomes, what tech startup is poised to do the same thing to their respective sector. Let's assume no company can be worth over $5T in the next 10 years. We need a company worth less than $50B whose sector is still ripe for the taking, and whose in the business of information. A sector whose legal hurdles have kept the incumbents safe from the efficiency of tech startups. A sector who created legal barriers that could resist a decade longer than taxi drivers could resist $Uber, or hotels vs $ABNB.

There are 3 answers : Finance, defense and gambling. These sectors have the highest barrier to entry of any. Their regulatory agencies are basically just a revolving door between government and industry. They are the most regulated sectors out there but they are finally starting to crack. Crony capitalism only works for so long.

From a pure computer science perspective, overtaking these sectors is not technical challenge, in the same way Unity is failing at becoming the universal game engine. There's no legal barrier to become a game engine. Activison, Take two interactive, Ubisoft, etc.. everyone wants $U to succeed but they're now years behind on their promised revolutionary Data oriented technology stack. Everyone wants $TSLA Full self driving to succeed, but they're years behind Musk's first promises of success by what? 2017?. But those are technically hard challenges, maybe impossible with current hardware limitations. Now if you want to bet on their success, good luck to you but I'm not interested in those investments. Only someone at the cutting-edge of those technologies can make well-informed decisions. Only someone at the cutting-edge of semi conducters could've guessed $NVDA would obliterate intel and amd. I won't pretend to have any such knowledge about the future as I make these observations about the past. This is not what this tech investment thesis is about.

And so in conclusion, three stocks stand out in their positioning and the state of their respective industry :

To start off, we'll go big in the cap spectrum.

Our millenial buys AAPL products, uses MSFT Excel and Outlook at their ""Information Worker"" job. They are frequently gamers, so they need to buy NVDA GPUs and AMD CPUs. They often buy these at AMZN.

They buy YouTube Premium and YouTube TV, so they can skip the ads of their fellow influencers (GOOGL)

They spent most of their waking hours at META's Instagram website.

They drive a TSLA or RIVN.

They're on the GLP-1 drug (LLY) to impress their SOs.

They're churning their credit cards with AXP Platinum and Gold, JPM's Chase Sapphire Preffered (no, NOT Reserve), some younger ones need to rely on COF's Venture and Venture X cards that gave nice ""subs"".

They use these cards frequently to eat out and earn those points at CMG, SHAK and SG.

They're flying a lot on DAL, and they need their free wifi that is often sponsored by their preferred choice of mobile carrier, TMUS.

To get to the airport they need to use UBER or LYFT, since they don't want to drive their sweet electric ride. When they arrive at their destination airport, they pick up their rental car, and of course they prefer AVIS (CAR), but their credit cards give them presential circle status on HTZ, so they are ok with that too.

They check into their hotel room at Marriott (MAR) to impress their friends, but really they are using all their Chase points to book Hyatt (H) hotels. The slightly less premium young ones will have to go Hilton (HLT) and fly on UAL.

They often booked all this travel on EXPE or BKNG. Sometimes they use ABNB.

When they check in they need to get some food, so they use their DASH gift card they bought at COST every two weeks because they get 20% off.

When they go to Vegas, they prefer to stay in WYNN, because it's where all the hot ones stay.

After they're done with their holidaying which they do basically 4 months out of the year, they're going to ULTA or LULU to buy their beauty products or Khakis.

They are drop shipping on SHOP and sometimes they need to use ZM to conduct ""business"" for their ""coaching classes"" that they teach. A lot of times they get paid using Venmo (PYPL).

Whatever money they make, they buy call options on HOOD.

At the end of the day their sugar daddy's give them a $1m deposit so they can buy those nice suburban homes built by TOL and furnished by WSM.

The primary reason for this was the release of the U.S. July ISM Non-Manufacturing Index, which rebounded from a four-year low in June to 51.4, exceeding market expectations and returning to the expansion zone above 50!

Sub-indices, including the New Orders Index and Employment Index, also showed growth. Notably, the Employment Index reached 51.1, marking the largest increase since September of last year and the first time this year that it has entered the expansion zone above 50. This data slightly alleviated fears from last week's significant non-farm payroll decline, making the market believe that the drop in new jobs was primarily due to Hurricane Barry hitting Texas.

👉 As discussed previously, the sharp decline in U.S. stocks at the start of August stemmed from worries about the U.S. economy falling into recession. Therefore, when the ISM Non-Manufacturing number showed growth yesterday, it somewhat restored market confidence in the economy, helping to narrow the intraday losses of U.S. stocks. The U.S. stock market now needs to see positive economic growth news to recover, unlike before when everyone was hoping for bad news, anticipating a Federal Reserve interest rate cut!

Hence, it is crucial to continue monitoring other economic data. If strong and robust growth numbers do not consistently appear, investors will remain concerned about an economic recession, and the trend of selling stocks for cash will not end. The VIX Fear Index is a crucial indicator to observe market sentiment calming down. It surged above 55 in early trading, a level not seen since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020!

403,AAPL,My theory why buffet sold aapl,"Everyone is freaking out about recession and also citing buffet selling half his stake in aapl as proof. But the reality is buffet doesn't time the market he holds good companies through recessions. But if you look at a lot of his other moves, sold all his TSM and a large portion of BYD as well. Its clear that buffet has geopolitical risks on the top of his mind, aapl would be obliterated in the case of a taiwan war. 

Afterall, why wouldn't he sell his American express position in a material way, wouldn't they get hit hard in a recession as well with delinquencies and decreased consumer spending? 

I guess this post doesn't really offer much reassurance as a taiwan war would be worse than a recession. But honestly I think you should trade like it wouldn't happen because if it does it would probably devolve into nuclear war and currency would be irrelevant at that point.

409,AAPL,"10K AAPL right now, hold 18 months","# Why

I believe in the Efficient Market Hypothesis and stock is already reflecting the AI hype around Apple Intelligence, but not the earnings and the impact of the tech when it actually releases for the public. 18 months is the time in which I believe there will be a positive impact reflected back into the stock price. 

# Diversification

Apple saw an increase in services revenue of 3B every year, and it can only grow. The main difference now is that there is AI and a better overall experience that can be sold at a higher price than usual. I can see how they will try to implement a better paywalled AI around the release of iOS 19, boosting other services with an Apple One pack. 

# No one upgrades, except this time

Older iPhones are not AI capable, and everyone that wants the new toy will have a reason to upgrade, the first real reason to upgrade since the iPhone X release. 



Not to mention the countless memes we will get, 2008 style dumb Siri videos. Unrelated, but can't wait for it.   




All considered I think they will get a huge boost in revenue, more fidelization and better diversification. Stock will grow, maintaining trajectory, good for investors. 

This is all buzz words and regarded reasoning, but what do you think? ",27,38,1722338962.0,2024-07-30T11:29:22+00:00,t3_1efqydk,"10K AAPL right now, hold 18 months # Why
