1,SMCI,BORING CSP's I'll be looking to sell this week (12/01 - 12/05),"I'm back for another weekly list of BORING CSP's that I'll be watching very close and hoping to sell cash-secured PUTS on. I'll definitely be selling and actively managing weekly CC's on NVDA, SMCI, and HPE. Check post history for prior weeks posts.

Last week was another defensive week as I only sold CC's while I continued to closely monitor price action. All signs are now cautiously pointing towards new CSP positions next week. Total premiums from CC's alone last week was $216 on $38.6k capital deployed (0.56% ROC).

Every trade is covered by cash (no margin) and I only take trades that show up on my BORING CSP's watchlists. Because I have the bandwidth throughout the day thanks to WFH, I aim for weekly or bi-weekly CSP's (with active management) otherwise I aim for 30-45 DTE.

7,SMCI,30-45 DTE wheel candidates. Which of these puts would you sell?,"ran a quick scan for puts expiring in a month or so. kept delta under .25 because i'm trying to potentially keep the premium this time.  
  
HOOD is dominating the scanner right now with those premiums (40%+ annualized), and honestly, the chart looks good for a rebound. But maybe a bit too volatile?  
  
SMCI is on the list but i value my sleep too much to touch that mess.  
  
Surprisingly, SOFI is looking like the actual adult in the room here. Trading around $28 with \~33% annualized yield? That feels like a decent sweet spot, selling the 25 puts seems like a solid way to farm theta without the heart palpitations you get with the crypto miners.  
  
Realistically though, it probably comes down to PLTR vs AMD. PLTR at 150 offers great premiums, but AMD at 195 feels like the ""responsible"" choice if you don't mind lower yields.  
  
What’s the consensus? Is SOFI finally a safe wheel candidate, or do I just take the boring money on AMD? What about RDDT?  
  
Started wheeling about a month or so ago so I would appreciate inputs.

1,SMCI,Hnrg is the next big play,"### 🚨 HNRG: The Most Undervalued Data-Center Power Play in America Right Now 🚨

While everyone is chasing the usual suspects (SMCI, VRT, DELL, IREN, CORZ) at 50–100x sales, there’s a tiny $350M market-cap company quietly positioned to become **the backbone of Indiana’s AI/data-center explosion** — and it’s still trading under $9.

**Hallador Energy (HNRG)** owns the 890 MW Merom coal-fired power plant in Sullivan County, Indiana — one of the few large, dispatchable, already-permitted power stations sitting in the heart of the Midwest data-center gold rush.

Here’s why HNRG could legitimately turn patient investors into millionaires over the next 3–5 years:

1. **Indiana is the new Ohio/Virginia for hyperscalers**  
   - 30+ hyperscale campuses under construction right now  
   - Amazon’s $11B New Carlisle campus, Google Fort Wayne, Meta Jeffersonville/Lebanon, Microsoft La Porte… the list keeps growing  
   - Combined demand projected to exceed **10 GW by 2030** — more power than the entire state of Indiana uses for residential today

2. **Merom is perfectly located &amp; already permitted**  
   - Sits on the Indiana-MISO grid where the new load is exploding  
   - Has existing 765 kV transmission lines — something new builds will wait 5–10 years for  
   - Fully permitted for coal → gas → nuclear conversion pathways

3. **The company is pivoting FAST**  
   - Q3 revenue +40% YoY, swung to $0.56 EPS profit  
   - Already signed LOIs to add **525 MW of new gas-fired generation** at Merom specifically targeted at data-center customers  
   - Management openly states they are in “multiple active discussions” with hyperscalers and co-developers for the remaining ~600 acres and power capacity

4. **Insanely cheap valuation**  
   - Current market cap ≈ $350M  
   - Forward 2026–2027 EBITDA guidance (just from existing coal + new gas) already points to **$150–200M+**  
   - That’s &lt;2.5x EBITDA while pure-play power providers to data centers trade 15–40x  
   - Plus they own 9+ million tons of coal reserves and Sunrise Coal — basically free optionality

5. **The millionaire math is stupidly simple**  
   If HNRG simply gets valued like the average data-center power provider (20x EBITDA) on just the **existing** Merom expansion plans → $3–4B market cap = **10x–12x from today**.  
   Add in potential nuclear SMR co-development or a full take-private by a hyperscaler and you’re looking at 20–50x territory.

Short float is still ~8.5% and dropping. Institutions have barely touched it. Most retail still thinks “coal = dead.”  
Meanwhile the same people paying 80x sales for air-cooling companies are missing the actual bottleneck: **electrons**.

$HNRG is the classic “hidden gem” setup:  
- Tiny float  
- Explosive secular tailwind (AI power shortage)  
- Catalyst-rich next 12–24 months (new PPAs, gas plant FID, potential nuclear announcements)  
- Trading at depression-level multiples

I’m not saying it happens tomorrow. But the same way $MRO and $APA made oil &amp; gas millionaires in 2021–2022, the next wave of AI infrastructure millionaires will come from the companies that actually deliver the megawatts.

Do your own DD, but HNRG screens as one of the highest asymmetric bets in the entire data-center food chain right now.

Who else is loading the truck under $9 while nobody’s watching? 👀

3,SMCI,Week 46 $988 in premium,"I will post a separate comment with a link to the detail behind each option sold this week.

After week 46 the average premium per week is $1,348 with an annual projection of $70,090.

All things considered, the portfolio is up $114,625 (+39.47%) on the year and up $124,011 (+39.52%) over the last 365 days. This is the overall profit and loss and includes options and all other account activity.

All options sold are backed by cash, shares, or LEAPS. I do not sell on margin, nor do I sell naked options.

All options and profits stay in the account with few exceptions. This is not my full time job, although I wish it was. I still grind on a 9-5. 

I contributed $600 last Friday to the portfolio, a 32 week contribution streak. I am stopping the contributions until January 2026. I have some unexpected expenses to address and then it’s back to business. 

The portfolio is comprised of 97 unique tickers, down from 100 last week. These 97 tickers have a value of $434k. I also have 212 open option positions, up from 206 last week.

I am over $147k in total options premium, since 2021. I average $29.69 per option sold. I have sold over 4,900 options. I have been able to increase the premiums on an annual basis and I will attempt to keep this upward trend going forward. 


Strategy:
The underlying strategy is buy and hold. I also use simple 1-legged options to supplement that strategy. Options have somewhat of a learning curve, but I believe that most people can supplement their investments using simple options with careful risk management. 

I sell options on a weekly basis. I prefer cash secured puts and covered calls. Sometimes I’m ahead of the indexes and sometimes I’m behind. My goal is consistency in option premium revenue. I am building an income stream that will continue long into retirement.

Spreadsheets:
Unfortunately, I no longer provide spreadsheets. I received too many follow ups about formatting, pivot tables, compatibility etc.I think tracking is very important, but I post to discuss investing and options, not provide tech support for Excel. I appreciate the interest in my tracking methods, though. 

Commissions:
I use Robinhood as a broker and they do not charge commissions. There is a an industry standard regulation fee of $0.03 per contract. Last year I sold just over 1,400 contracts which is just over $40.00 in fees paid in 2024. In 2025, the contract fee is $0.04, which would push the fees up to around $60 based on current projections.  

The premiums have increased significantly as my experience has expanded over the last three years.

1,SMCI,Why Super Micro computer is the obvious play,"Super Micro Computer (SMCI) remains a high-conviction play in the AI infrastructure space, leveraging its rack-scale server expertise and tight Nvidia partnerships to capture explosive demand. Despite a post-earnings dip to ~$42 (down ~10% on Nov 5), the stock trades at an undemanding valuation, setting up asymmetric upside as deferred revenues unlock in Q2. With a massive &gt;$14B order backlog and expanding manufacturing capacity, SMCI is positioned for multi-year growth in the AI data center buildout—think hyperscalers upgrading to Blackwell GPUs at scale.

Q1 FY26 Results &amp; Updated Q2 Guidance: Q1 revenue came in at $5.02B (miss vs. $6.09B est., -18% QoQ), with EPS at $0.35 (vs. $0.41 est.), pressured by ~$1.8B in deferred rack shipments tied to customer validations and supply chain timing. Margins held steady at ~14.5%, reflecting cost controls amid volume ramps. However, the real story is the new Q2 guidance, upgraded in the earnings call to reflect full deferred recognition: official range of $5.9B–$6.2B, but management explicitly signaled “double-digit potential” (10B+), driven by Q1 deferrals + accelerated Blackwell system deployments. Analysts (e.g., Rosenblatt, Barclays) model $9–11B for Q2—a ~100% QoQ surge—aligning with FY26 full-year outlook now raised to ≥$36B. This isn’t organic weakness; it’s a classic timing shift, with no lost orders.

Current Valuation: At $42, SMCI trades at a rock-bottom ~0.7x FY26 P/S (on $36B rev guidance), vs. peers like Dell (1.2x) and HPE (1.0x)—and that’s before baking in the Q2 upside to 40–44B annualized run-rate. Forward P/E ~15x on expected $2.80+ EPS, with ROIC accelerating on AI margins. The dip embeds bearish fears of volatility, but ignores the backlog’s strength and capex tailwinds (Malaysia/USA factories at full tilt).

Historical Pattern &amp; Catalysts: SMCI’s playbook is consistent: Q1/Q2 “misses” on deferrals (3/3 since 2024), followed by Q3/Q4 beats (avg. +10% vs. est., +50–180% stock gains over 3–12 months). Q2 here mirrors Q1’24’s setup but with 2x the backlog and Nvidia’s GPU guarantees. Key catalysts: Blackwell validation completions (Dec), hyperscaler wins (5+ in queue), and no major bottlenecks.

Looking at the numbers we could expect tommorows earnings reports to beat by 2-3 cents for an eps of ~1.27±0.02 (current estimates are 1.24)

So, I'm driving to work and I decided I really wanted to see the numbers between the grift cycles of resellers/scalpers  and collectors of different niches, I looked at graphics cards, Labubus, FunkoPops and Pokemon. 

The results are actually incredible. I’m not going to make you read some insanely long blog post to get the information your here for. So with out further adieu; CHART

Pokemon popularity and eBay earnings

It’s pretty close right? When we look at that chart it almost seems like they match pretty well. But it gets magical when we shift the chart by two quarters.Pokemon popularity and eBay quarterly earnings, shift two quarters to the right

https://keystonequant.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/10/IMG_9558.png

Running regression on this we get some really sexy results.

‘’’Lag-1 (Pokémon Q3'25=91 → Q4):
ebay = 2.457 + 0.0025 × 91 = $2.687B (R²=74%)
Lag-2 (Pokémon Q2'25=96 → Q4):
ebay = 2.463 + 0.0028 × 96 = $2.733B(R²=81%)
 Ensemble: $2.710B | 95% CI: $2.68–2.74B
The model perfectly hit Q3 guidance ($2.69–2.74B → actual $2.73B Q2).’’’

Need Confirmation? The recent poke-boom = confirmation: Last 8Q (rising Pokémon era): Lag1/2 hit 89-90% correlation, 79-81% R² — Pokémon alone “causes/correlates to” ~80% of eBay’s 2025 revenue explosion (from $2.57B → $2.74B).

Bottom Line: Pokémon = eBay’s leading indicator with ~80%+ predictive power recently.

2,SMCI,"AI is changing everything, But where are the real investment opportunities?","Having worked in tech and invested for several years, I wanted to share how I’m thinking about AI and opportunity.  
I’m from Singapore, now living in Silicon Valley as a tech enthusiast. I’ve always hoped I’d be one of the builders of the AI age. But lately it feels harder and harder to see where real opportunities are.  
When people talk about industrial revolutions, it’s always about inventors like James Watt or machines like the spinning jenny. But you almost never hear about the weavers who lost their jobs, even though, for example, around two-thirds of them were displaced during the first revolution.  
To me, AI feels a bit like that. It’s reshaping entire industries at a pace that’s hard to keep up with, and in many cases it seems to replace more roles than it creates. In some fields, it even reduces the need for human coordination altogether.a fintech CEO mentioned at the All-In Summit(AI and tokenization could broaden access to investing and early-stage opportunities, not just for big players.)  That got me wondering whether ordinary people today still have meaningful ways to take part in this wave of change, rather than just watch it unfold?  
I’ve been trying to balance between staying exposed to AI and not getting caught in the hype. Right now my portfolio is roughly 40% in broad index ETFs like VTI and QQQ, 25% in AI-related tech like NVDA, SMCI, and a bit of ARM, 20% in commodities and defensive sectors, and the rest in cash and some early-stage exposure through private investing platforms.

Feels like the market’s already pricing in a lot of AI optimism. Curious how others here are handling it. Are you adding to your AI plays, staying diversified, or just waiting for a pullback before doing anything?

Last week was another steady week selling CSP's for the the usual suspects (GOOG, NVDA) and the new kids on the block (DAL, SMCI\*). Sold CC's on UAL, NVDA.

Total premiums was \~$655 on \~$96k capital deployed (~0.7% ROC).

Every trade is covered by cash (no margin) and I only take trades that show up on my BORING CSP's watchlists. Because I have the bandwidth throughout the day thanks to WFH, I aim for weekly or bi-weekly CSP's otherwise I aim for 30-45 DTE.

3,SMCI,"Portfolio review needed - High concentration risk, approaching NZ tax threshold","Looking for advice on my portfolio. I'm in New Zealand, 5-10 year timeline, goal is to reach $310k NZD (\~$177k USD) to pay off mortgage. Comfortable with volatility but concerned about concentration.

**Current positions (total: $85.7k NZD / \~$49k USD):**

* TSLA: 29.6% ($25.3k) - +102% return
* RKLB: 28.7% ($24.6k) - +432% return
* NVDA: 14.5% ($12.4k) - +61% return

* AMZN: 7.4% ($6.4k) - +49% return
* SHOP: 5.4% ($4.6k) - +165% return
* IBIT: 1.2% ($1.0k) - +26% return
* SMCI: 0.9% ($785) - -13% return
* OPEN: 0.6% ($498) - +186% return (but all analysts rate it sell)
* LLY: 0.5% ($451) - -13% return
* NIO: 0.5% ($414) - -34% return

**Key concerns:**

1. 58% concentrated in just two stocks (TSLA + RKLB) - both have been huge winners but feeling exposed
2. Approaching NZ's $50k foreign investment tax threshold (based on cost basis) where I'll owe annual tax on 5% of portfolio value regardless of gains
3. Planning to DCA $10k NZD (\~$5.7k USD) per year going forward

**Questions:**

* Should I trim TSLA/RKLB back to 10% each and diversify, or let winners run?
* Should I use some of those trimmings to get VOO to at least 30% for safety?
* Any specific sectors or stocks you'd recommend adding for better balance?
* Should I be thinking about the NZ tax threshold differently?

1. 58% concentrated in just two stocks (TSLA + RKLB) - both have been huge winners but feeling exposed
2. Approaching NZ's $50k foreign investment tax threshold (based on cost basis) where I'll owe annual tax on 5% of portfolio value regardless of gains
3. Planning to DCA $10k NZD (\~$5.7k USD) per year going forward

**Questions:**

* Should I trim TSLA/RKLB back to 10% each and diversify, or let winners run?
* Should I use some of those trimmings to get VOO to at least 30% for safety?
* Any specific sectors or stocks you'd recommend adding for better balance?
* Should I be thinking about the NZ tax threshold differently?

8,SMCI,"Week 41 $2,845 in premium","I will post a separate comment with a link to the detail behind each option sold this week.

After week 41 the average premium per week is $1,374 with an annual projection of $71,454.

All things considered, the portfolio is up $150,374 (+46.79%) on the year and up $174,221 (+58.55% over the last 365 days. This is the overall profit and loss and includes options and all other account activity.

All options sold are backed by cash, shares, or LEAPS. I do not sell on margin, nor do I sell naked options.

All options and profits stay in the account with few exceptions. This is not my full time job, although I wish it was. I still grind on a 9-5. 

I contributed $600 on Friday to the portfolio, a 28 week contribution streak.

The portfolio is comprised of 100 unique tickers, unchanged from 100 last week. These 100 tickers have a value of $464k. I also have 215 open option positions, up from 212 last week. The options have a total value of $9k. The total of the shares and options is $473k. The next goal on the “Road to” is Half a Million. 

I’m currently utilizing $29,400 in cash secured put collateral, down from $39,550 last week.

2025 through 2028 LEAPS
In addition to the CSPs and covered calls, I purchase LEAPS. These act as collateral to sell covered calls against. You may have heard of poor man’s covered calls (PMCC). The LEAPS are down $5,582 this week and are up +$236,973 overall.

See r/ExpiredOptions for a detailed spreadsheet update on all LEAPS positions including P/L for each individual position.

LEAPS note 1: the 2025 LEAPS expired 1/17/25. They were up $36,440 overall with a 233.74% increase. The major drivers were AMZN and CRWD.

LEAPS note 2: After holding for 2 years, I exercised an AMZN $80 strike from 2023 up +$11,395 (+463.21%) and CRWD $95 strike from 2023, up +$21,830 (+663.53%)

LEAPS note 3: Purchased 1/16/26 CRWD LEAPS for $8,230.03 on 1/17/24. I sold this LEAPS on 6/5/25 for $21,659 for a realized profit of $13,428.97 (+163.18%)

I am over $142k in total options premium, since 2021. I average $29.36 per option sold. I have sold over 4,800 options. I have been able to increase the premiums on an annual basis and I will attempt to keep this upward trend going forward. 


Strategy:
The underlying strategy is buy and hold. I also use simple 1-legged options to supplement that strategy. Options have somewhat of a learning curve, but I believe that most people can supplement their investments using simple options with careful risk management. 

I sell options on a weekly basis. I prefer cash secured puts and covered calls. Sometimes I’m ahead of the indexes and sometimes I’m behind. My goal is consistency in option premium revenue. I am building an income stream that will continue long into retirement.

Spreadsheets:
Unfortunately, I no longer provide spreadsheets. I received too many follow ups about formatting, pivot tables, compatibility etc.I think tracking is very important, but I post to discuss investing and options, not provide tech support for Excel. I appreciate the interest in my tracking methods, though. 

Commissions:
I use Robinhood as a broker and they do not charge commissions. There is a an industry standard regulation fee of $0.03 per contract. Last year I sold just over 1,400 contracts which is just over $40.00 in fees paid in 2024. In 2025, the contract fee is $0.04, which would push the fees up to around $60 based on current projections.  

The premiums have increased significantly as my experience has expanded over the last three years.

Not only that but a 15 year contract with Coreweave that is estimated to rack them in 11 billion. Could be way more, this stock is undervalued heavily. Hope this helps you out!!

I just opened OKLO after their 20% day so no huge gains there but up a bit still

These are my favorite options in this stupid bull market, the decay is relatively slow but they still respond nicely to price moves and you can get some crazy leverage

I've sold a good chunk of that GOOG position but it was up 200-300% over the range of contracts I've exited

they also can cause big losses pretty quickly too of course, the cava is a rolled out and up refresh of a position i had that was down 50% after their earnings day

i think they have good potential if you stick with it and manage the leverage and exposure you have. i bought shares of SMCI at 120 (post split so 1200 pre split ie the top) and held it down 60% i then flipped all that to smci doom leaps and after 6-9 months of working those it eventually turned into a huge profit just from a spike of smci going 40 to 50+ or so, if i had just sat on the shares i would still be down &gt;60%",16,10,1758643799.0,2025-09-23T16:09:59+00:00,t3_1nolkzk,options,"Current DOOM LEAPS open DOOM = deep out of the money

9,SMCI,Week 36 $665 in premium,"I will post a separate comment with a link to the detail behind each option sold this week.

After week 36 the average premium per week is $1,198 with an annual projection of $62,270.

All things considered, the portfolio is up $118,093 (+37.11%) on the year and up $187,087 (+75.06% over the last 365 days. This is the overall profit and loss and includes options and all other account activity.

All options sold are backed by cash, shares, or LEAPS. I do not sell on margin, nor do I sell naked options.

All options and profits stay in the account with few exceptions. This is not my full time job, although I wish it was. I still grind on a 9-5. 

I contributed $600 this week, a 23 week contribution streak.

The portfolio is comprised of 99 unique tickers, unchanged from 99 last week. These 99 tickers have a value of $409k. I also have 182 open option positions, down from 187 last week. The options have a total value of $21k. The total of the shares and options is $430k. The next goal on the “Road to” is $450k. 

I’m currently utilizing $44,950 in cash secured put collateral, up from $42,050 last week.

2025 &amp; 2026 &amp; 2027 LEAPS
In addition to the CSPs and covered calls, I purchase LEAPS. These act as collateral to sell covered calls against. You may have heard of poor man’s covered calls (PMCC). The LEAPS are down -$287 this week and are up +$149,823 overall.

See r/ExpiredOptions for a detailed spreadsheet update on all LEAPS positions including P/L for each individual position.

LEAPS note 1: the 2025 LEAPS expired 1/17/25. They were up $36,440 overall with a 233.74% increase. The major drivers were AMZN and CRWD.

LEAPS note 2: After holding for 2 years, I exercised an AMZN $80 strike from 2023 up +$11,395 (+463.21%) and CRWD $95 strike from 2023, up +$21,830 (+663.53%)

LEAPS note 3: Purchased 1/16/26 CRWD LEAPS for $8,230.03 on 1/17/24. I sold this LEAPS on 6/5/25 for $21,659 for a realized profit of $13,428.97 (+163.18%)

I am over $131k in total options premium, since 2021. I average $29.21 per option sold. I have sold over 4,500 options. I have been able to increase the premiums on an annual basis and I will attempt to keep this upward trend going forward. 


Strategy:
The underlying strategy is buy and hold. I also use simple 1-legged options to supplement that strategy. Options have somewhat of a learning curve, but I believe that most people can supplement their investments using simple options with careful risk management. 

I sell options on a weekly basis. I prefer cash secured puts and covered calls. Sometimes I’m ahead of the indexes and sometimes I’m behind. My goal is consistency in option premium revenue. I am building an income stream that will continue long into retirement.

Spreadsheets:
Unfortunately, I no longer provide spreadsheets. I received too many follow ups about formatting, pivot tables, compatibility etc.I think tracking is very important, but I post to discuss investing and options, not provide tech support for Excel. I appreciate the interest in my tracking methods, though. 

Commissions:
I use Robinhood as a broker and they do not charge commissions. There is a an industry standard regulation fee of $0.03 per contract. Last year I sold just over 1,400 contracts which is just over $40.00 in fees paid in 2024. In 2025, the contract fee is $0.04, which would push the fees up to around $60 based on current projections.  

The premiums have increased significantly as my experience has expanded over the last three years. 

Make sure to post your wins. I look forward to reading about them!",66,29,1757124420.0,2025-09-06T02:07:00+00:00,t3_1n9nomj,thetagang,"Week 36 $665 in premium I will post a separate comment with a link to the detail behind each option sold this week.

After week 36 the average premium per week is $1,198 with an annual projection of $62,270.

All things considered, the portfolio is up $118,093 (+37.11%) on the year and up $187,087 (+75.06% over the last 365 days. This is the overall profit and loss and includes options and all other account activity.

All options sold are backed by cash, shares, or LEAPS. I do not sell on margin, nor do I sell naked options.

All options and profits stay in the account with few exceptions. This is not my full time job, although I wish it was. I still grind on a 9-5. 

I contributed $600 this week, a 23 week contribution streak.

The portfolio is comprised of 99 unique tickers, unchanged from 99 last week. These 99 tickers have a value of $409k. I also have 182 open option positions, down from 187 last week. The options have a total value of $21k. The total of the shares and options is $430k. The next goal on the “Road to” is $450k. 

I’m currently utilizing $44,950 in cash secured put collateral, up from $42,050 last week.

In addition to the CSPs and covered calls, I purchase LEAPS. These act as collateral to sell covered calls against. You may have heard of poor man’s covered calls (PMCC). The LEAPS are down -$287 this week and are up +$149,823 overall.

See r/ExpiredOptions for a detailed spreadsheet update on all LEAPS positions including P/L for each individual position.

LEAPS note 1: the 2025 LEAPS expired 1/17/25. They were up $36,440 overall with a 233.74% increase. The major drivers were AMZN and CRWD.

LEAPS note 2: After holding for 2 years, I exercised an AMZN $80 strike from 2023 up +$11,395 (+463.21%) and CRWD $95 strike from 2023, up +$21,830 (+663.53%)

**Key Nuggets from CEO in Last 3 Conference Calls:**

**FQ4 2025 (Feb. 26, 2025):**

""There are now multiple scaling laws. There is the **pre-training scaling law**, and that is going to continue to scale because we have multimodality, we have data that came from reasoning that are now used to do pretraining. And then the second is **post-training scaling law**, using reinforcement learning human feedback, reinforcement learning AI feedback, reinforcement learning, verifiable rewards. The amount of computation you use for post training is actually higher than pretraining. And it is kind of sensible in the sense that you could, while you are using reinforcement learning, generate an enormous amount of synthetic data or synthetically generated tokens. AI models are basically generating tokens to train AI models. And that's post training. And the third part, this is the part that you mentioned is **test time computation or reasoning, long thinking, inference scaling**. They are all basically the same ideas. And there you have a chain of thought, you have searched. The amount of tokens generated and the amount of inference compute needed is already 100x more than the one-shot examples and the one-shot capabilities of large language models in the beginning. And that is just the beginning. This is just the beginning. The idea that the next generation could have thousands of times and even hopefully, extremely thoughtful and simulation-based and search-based models that could be hundreds of thousands, millions of times more compute than today is in our future.""

**FQ1 2026 (May 28, 2025):**

**""Grace Blackwell NVLink72 is the ideal engine today, the ideal computer thinking machine, if you will, for reasoning AI. There's a couple of reasons for that. The first reason is that the token generation amount, the number of tokens reasoning goes through, is 100 times, 1,000 times more than a one-shot chatbot. It's essentially thinking to itself, breaking down a problem step-by-step. It might be planning multiple paths to an answer. It could be using tools, reading PDFs, reading web pages, watching videos, and then producing a result, an answer. The longer it thinks,** **the better the answer**, **the smarter the answer is**. And so, what we would like to do, and the reason why Grace Blackwell was designed to give such a giant step-up in inference performance, is so that you could do all this and still get a response as quickly as possible. **Compared to Hopper, Grace Blackwell is some 40 times higher speed and throughput compared.** And so, this is going to be a huge, huge benefit in driving down the cost while improving the quality of response with excellent quality of service at the same time. So, that's the fundamental reason. That was the core driving reason for Grace Blackwell NVLink72. Of course, in order to do that, we had to reinvent, literally redesign the entire way that these supercomputers are built, and -- but now we're in full production. It's going to be exciting. It's going to be incredibly exciting.""

**FQ2 2025 (August 27, 2025):**

""And so we are really an AI infrastructure company, and we are hoping to continue to contribute to growing this industry, making AI more useful and then very importantly, driving the performance per watt because the world, as you mentioned, limiters, it will always likely be power limitations or AI -- building limitations. And so we need to squeeze as much out of that factory as possible. **NVIDIA's performance per unit of energy used drives the revenue growth of that factory.** It directly translates. If you have a 100- megawatt factory, performance per 100 megawatt drives your revenues. It is tokens per 100 megawatts of factory. In our case also, the performance per dollar spent is so high that your gross margins are also the best. But anyhow, these are the limiters going forward and $3 trillion to $4 trillion is fairly sensible for the next 5 years.""

$PACS - skilled nursing facilities (SNF) assisted living facilities in the USA (in short Nursing home)  
Provides senior care and independent facilities, buy/lease real-estate for health care related properties

Founded in Utah in 2013, IPO in 2024  
Similar company: $ENSG  
Revenue: Coming from leasing facilities and insurance reimbursement based on the number of residents  
Finalized acquisition by taking over operations of Prestige Care’s entire SNF portfolio i.e 56 facilities across 6 states and added 2889 skilled nursing beds

Occupancy rate is still at a pretty high level \~90% in comparison of the 70% for the other players of the sector. The best part? Mature facilities are displaying \~93% occupancy rate.

**What happened?** Why did the stock got hammered and my previous options railed?

Old Hindenburg research group (**which interestingly enough does not exist anymore?**) made a claim that PACS is inflating their numbers by abusing covid era waiver to make more money as well as misleading investors with wrong CMS ratings.

Recall that the waiver allowed beneficiaries to receive Medicare-covered SNF care without a prior hospital stay of at least three days. It expired with the end of the federal Public Health Emergency (PHE) on **May 11, 2023**

Since then PACS went terribly down, way more than I initially expected

Apart from SPY and BRK.B, I also own 10 individual stocks. I used to own QQQ, but I decided to sell all of it and pick my own tech stocks instead.

34,SMCI,I just sold a decent amount of stock..,"32, $890k networth, I decided to be a little manic and sell a good amount of stock today. 

I sold: 

APLD +70%

ONDS +100%

SMCI +10% (small position)

That now puts me at 32% cash, not sure why I'm sharing, just thought I would, I see a lot of repetitive information on here, so I thought I would share something new. 

I also started a position in Dow Chemical, just 100 shares, but yeah

I thought about selling some $HOOD and possibly my $META position, but I've always told myself that those are my lifers, so not sure if I will or not. Might sell some $HOOD tomorrow if it pops when they release their July numbers.

$QQQ +60%

$ARKW +120%

$NVDA +270%

$VRT +40%

$AAPL +40%

Not sure what I'll do with the cash, moved most of it to $SGOV, so $175k in $SGOV, 25k in Fidelity that I will slowly buy positions with and then like $87k in Robinhood cash position.

10,SMCI,"Week 32 $1,590 in premium","I will post a separate comment with a link to the detail behind each option sold this week.

After week 32 the average premium per week is $1,245 with an annual projection of $64,751.

All things considered, the portfolio is up $109,851 (+34.78%) on the year and up $186,784 (+78.19%) over the last 365 days. This is the overall profit and loss and includes options and all other account activity.

All options sold are backed by cash, shares, or LEAPS. I do not sell on margin, nor do I sell naked options.

All options and profits stay in the account with few exceptions. This is not my full time job, although I wish it was. I still grind on a 9-5. 

I contributed $600 this week, a 19 week contribution streak.

The portfolio is comprised of 92 unique tickers, down from 93 last week. These 92 tickers have a value of $417k. I also have 179 open option positions, down from 180 last week. The options have a total value of $8k. The total of the shares and options is $425k. The next goal on the “Road to” is $450k. 

I’m currently utilizing $37,700 in cash secured put collateral, down from $42,300 last week.

2025 &amp; 2026 &amp; 2027 LEAPS
In addition to the CSPs and covered calls, I purchase LEAPS. These act as collateral to sell covered calls against. You may have heard of poor man’s covered calls (PMCC). The LEAPS are up +$24,445 this week and are up +$161,309 overall.

See r/ExpiredOptions for a detailed spreadsheet update on all LEAPS positions including P/L for each individual position.

LEAPS note 1: the 2025 LEAPS expired 1/17/25. They were up $36,440 overall with a 233.74% increase. The major drivers were AMZN and CRWD.

LEAPS note 2: After holding for 2 years, I exercised an AMZN $80 strike from 2023 up +$11,395 (+463.21%) and CRWD $95 strike from 2023, up +$21,830 (+663.53%)

LEAPS note 3: Purchased 1/16/26 CRWD LEAPS for $8,230.03 on 1/17/24. I sold this LEAPS on 6/5/25 for $21,659 for a realized profit of $13,428.97 (+163.18%)

2025 up $109,851 (+34.78%) YTD

I am over $128k in total options premium, since 2021. I average $29.20 per option sold. I have sold over 4,400 options. I have been able to increase the premiums on an annual basis and I will attempt to keep this upward trend going forward. 


Strategy:
The underlying strategy is buy and hold. I also use simple 1-legged options to supplement that strategy. Options have somewhat of a learning curve, but I believe that most people can supplement their investments using simple options with careful risk management. 

I sell options on a weekly basis. I prefer cash secured puts and covered calls. Sometimes I’m ahead of the indexes and sometimes I’m behind. My goal is consistency in option premium revenue. I am building an income stream that will continue long into retirement.

Spreadsheets:
Unfortunately, I no longer provide spreadsheets. I received too many follow ups about formatting, pivot tables, compatibility etc.I think tracking is very important, but I post to discuss investing and options, not provide tech support for Excel. I appreciate the interest in my tracking methods, though. 

Commissions:
I use Robinhood as a broker and they do not charge commissions. There is a an industry standard regulation fee of $0.03 per contract. Last year I sold just over 1,400 contracts which is just over $40.00 in fees paid in 2024. In 2025, the contract fee is $0.04, which would push the fees up to around $60 based on current projections.  

The premiums have increased significantly as my experience has expanded over the last three years. 

Make sure to post your wins. I look forward to reading about them!

# Points to keep in mind

1. Data from Google Finance and Yahoo Finance.
2. Some stocks had very little or no options volume.
3. **In the post-earnings option price I am not taking into account the time value.**
4. For the strike I always use the closest to the closing price.

A stock has no options and another did not trade any put on 08/07/2025 with strike 17.5 and I made up the price (the one in red in the last image).

Why do companies that even their CEO doesn't know appear on Earnings Whispers?

# Is there a winning strategy?

When someone posts that they've gone from 100k to 200k with one of these plays I wonder:

Why didn't that person post the 100k YOLO?

Wouldn't that person be willing to publish his losses out of shame if he lost?

There are always people betting on both sides, there are always winners and losers.

What's the point of this then?

I would love to see someone go from 1k or 10k to 1M or more with several winning bets in a row.

1k \* 2\^10 = 1,024,000

10k \* 2\^7 = 1,280,000

Can anyone really get it right 7 times in a row?

With a lot of luck, you can even multiply by more than 2 and need to get it right less often.

I hope you share your opinion. Thanks for reading.

A stock has no options and another did not trade any put on 08/07/2025 with strike 17.5 and I made up the price (the one in red in the last image).

Why do companies that even their CEO doesn't know appear on Earnings Whispers?

# Is there a winning strategy?

When someone posts that they've gone from 100k to 200k with one of these plays I wonder:

Why didn't that person post the 100k YOLO?

Wouldn't that person be willing to publish his losses out of shame if he lost?

There are always people betting on both sides, there are always winners and losers.

What's the point of this then?

I would love to see someone go from 1k or 10k to 1M or more with several winning bets in a row.

1k \* 2\^10 = 1,024,000

10k \* 2\^7 = 1,280,000

Can anyone really get it right 7 times in a row?

With a lot of luck, you can even multiply by more than 2 and need to get it right less often.

I hope you share your opinion. Thanks for reading.

(Reuters) -Super Micro missed Wall Street estimates for fourth-quarter revenue and profit on Tuesday, as the company battles larger server makers for high-performance computers used to train artificial-intelligence models.

Shares of the San Jose, California-based firm slumped 15% in extended trading. They have soared 91% this year, as investors bet on strong demand for its AI servers and its liquid cooling solutions.

Super Micro has been gaining traction in the hyper-competitive server industry, but analysts have said larger rivals such as Dell Technologies and HP Enterprise have been able to leverage their vast customer base to boost sales.

""Since we know the market for servers is very strong right now, it is safe to assume the disappointing results for Super Micro are due to share losses,"" said Gil Luria, managing director at D.A. Davidson &amp; Co.

""Their customers are very discerning right now and are choosing servers from Dell, HP and others,"" Luria added.

Super Micro expects revenue of at least $33 billion for fiscal year 2026, compared to analysts' average estimate of $29.94 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.

The company, which is bouncing back from accounting-related issues, said revenue for the three months ended June 30 was $5.76 billion, compared with analysts' average estimate of $5.89 billion.

6. Raised 2.3 billion cash and sold 1.79 billion in receivables for expansion. Big-brain move at 0% interest with capped calls. They are currently generating cash and not burning it, which means the money is primarily for planned massive growth and expansion.

Strategy:
The underlying strategy is buy and hold. I also use simple 1-legged options to supplement that strategy. Options have somewhat of a learning curve, but I believe that most people can supplement their investments using simple options with careful risk management. 

I sell options on a weekly basis. I prefer cash secured puts and covered calls. Sometimes I’m ahead of the indexes and sometimes I’m behind. My goal is consistency in option premium revenue. I am building an income stream that will continue long into retirement.

Spreadsheets:
Unfortunately, I no longer provide spreadsheets. I received too many follow ups about formatting, pivot tables, compatibility etc.I think tracking is very important, but I post to discuss investing and options, not provide tech support for Excel. I appreciate the interest in my tracking methods, though. 

Commissions:
I use Robinhood as a broker and they do not charge commissions. There is a an industry standard regulation fee of $0.03 per contract. Last year I sold just over 1,400 contracts which is just over $40.00 in fees paid in 2024. In 2025, the contract fee is $0.04, which would push the fees up to around $60 based on current projections.  

The premiums have increased significantly as my experience has expanded over the last three years.

I am over $127k in total options premium, since 2021. I average $29.05 per option sold. I have sold over 4,300 options. I have been able to increase the premiums on an annual basis and I will attempt to keep this upward trend going forward. 


Strategy:
The underlying strategy is buy and hold. I also use simple 1-legged options to supplement that strategy. Options have somewhat of a learning curve, but I believe that most people can supplement their investments using simple options with careful risk management. 

I sell options on a weekly basis. I prefer cash secured puts and covered calls. Sometimes I’m ahead of the indexes and sometimes I’m behind. My goal is consistency in option premium revenue. I am building an income stream that will continue long into retirement.

Spreadsheets:
Unfortunately, I no longer provide spreadsheets. I received too many follow ups about formatting, pivot tables, compatibility etc.I think tracking is very important, but I post to discuss investing and options, not provide tech support for Excel. I appreciate the interest in my tracking methods, though. 

Commissions:
I use Robinhood as a broker and they do not charge commissions. There is a an industry standard regulation fee of $0.03 per contract. Last year I sold just over 1,400 contracts which is just over $40.00 in fees paid in 2024. In 2025, the contract fee is $0.04, which would push the fees up to around $60 based on current projections.  

The premiums have increased significantly as my experience has expanded over the last three years.

I figured after getting some interest in my post about the custom Collar trades i posted about last week that i would do a follow up that breaks down more of the positions i'm holding that could be of use to some traders looking for a way to express their sentiment towards the underlying stocks.

My portfolio performance **YTD:**

Return: +11.30% (net to account)

Current Return @ Expiration: +19.64% (average expiration is June 2027)

Sharpe Ratio: +2.87

Current Margin loan Rate: 5.83%

Current Margin Balance: $77,126

I am using portfolio margin to hold these trades as the margin requirement is near non-existent due to the low level of risk and i have about $77k in positions on margin which i aim to pay off with any profit retained from the collar. my leverage factor is about 1.85.

The goal of this strategy is to provide some upside opportunity over the next 2 1/2 years to expiration while completely mitigating any downside risk. I'm attaching 2 of these trades i currently hold this week out of a total of 13 collars to give you some insight into which trades i tend to take.

46,SMCI,I calculated which stocks are most sensitive to tariff news,"In preparation for the August 1 tariff deadlines, I think it's important to know which stocks are most and least sensitive to tariff-related news. This will allow us to select exactly the stocks that will change the most when new tariff changes are announced, or buy the ones that are least sensitive to hedge your position or profit from the opposite direction.

To calculate the sensitivity of stocks to this news, I first looked at which trading days the returns of the S&amp;P 500 were dominated by tariff announcements. I used [this New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/business/economy/trump-tariff-timeline.html) to find the days on which important announcements were made. If the news was on a non-trading day, I then assumed the next trading day was impacted by the news.

I then regressed the daily returns of each stock in the S&amp;P 500 on the S&amp;P 500 itself (to calculate the market beta), and on a vector that contains the returns of the S&amp;P 500 when there are important tariff announcements, and 0 otherwise (to calculate the beta to tariff news). I used daily returns since the start of 2025.

I find that these stocks are the 10 stocks *most* sensitive to tariff news:

| Company Name                              | Beta to Market | Beta to Tariffs |
|-------------------------------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| APA Corporation                           | 0.83           | 1.32            |
| Halliburton Company                       | 0.38           | 1.25            |

| Delta Air Lines, Inc.                     | 1.19           | 0.86            |

And these 10 stocks show up as being *least* sensitive:

| Company Name                                 | Beta to Market | Beta to Tariffs |
|----------------------------------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Molina Healthcare, Inc.                      | 0.75           | -0.85           |

| PulteGroup, Inc.                             | 1.32           | -0.74           |
| Coinbase Global, Inc. Class A                | 2.59           | -0.74           |
| Palantir Technologies Inc. Class A           | 2.65           | -0.74           |
| Super Micro Computer, Inc.                   | 2.63           | -0.74           |
| Centene Corporation                          | 0.58           | -0.68           |
| First Solar, Inc.                            | 1.50           | -0.63           |
| Erie Indemnity Company Class A               | 0.90           | -0.62           |
| Fair Isaac Corporation                       | 1.49           | -0.61           |

How should you interpret these results?

Well, for example, if on August 1 Trump announces something that makes the S&amp;P 500 shoot up, then APA Corporation is expected to shoot up by 0.83 (beta to market) + 1.32 (beta to tariffs) = 2.15 that amount! So if the S&amp;P 500 goes up by 5%, APA Corporation is expected to go up by 10.75%! This also works the other way around: if news comes out that makes the market go down, the companies *sensitive* to this news will go down more.

The companies that are least sensitive are expected to go the other way. For example, if the S&amp;P 500 goes *down* by 1% because of new tariff changes, Molina Healthcare is expected to move by 0.75% - 0.85% = -0.10% in the other direction. Hence, it will actually go up slightly!

In other words, the *sensitive* stocks co-move with the market (no matter if up or down), the *insensitive* stocks barely move, or move opposite to the market.

Use this to your advantage!

How should you interpret these results?

Well, for example, if on August 1 Trump announces something that makes the S&amp;P 500 shoot up, then APA Corporation is expected to shoot up by 0.83 (beta to market) + 1.32 (beta to tariffs) = 2.15 that amount! So if the S&amp;P 500 goes up by 5%, APA Corporation is expected to go up by 10.75%! This also works the other way around: if news comes out that makes the market go down, the companies *sensitive* to this news will go down more.

The companies that are least sensitive are expected to go the other way. For example, if the S&amp;P 500 goes *down* by 1% because of new tariff changes, Molina Healthcare is expected to move by 0.75% - 0.85% = -0.10% in the other direction. Hence, it will actually go up slightly!

In other words, the *sensitive* stocks co-move with the market (no matter if up or down), the *insensitive* stocks barely move, or move opposite to the market.

Use this to your advantage!

2,SMCI,I calculated which stocks are most sensitive to tariff announcements,"In preparation for the August 1 tariff deadlines, I think it's important to know which stocks are most and least sensitive to tariff-related news. This will allow us to select exactly the stocks that will change the most when new tariff changes are announced, or buy the ones that are least sensitive to hedge your position or profit from the opposite direction.

To calculate the sensitivity of stocks to this news, I first looked at which trading days the returns of the S&amp;P 500 were dominated by tariff announcements. I used [this New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/business/economy/trump-tariff-timeline.html) to find the days on which important announcements were made. If the news was on a non-trading day, I then assumed the next trading day was impacted by the news.

I then regressed the daily returns of each stock in the S&amp;P 500 on the S&amp;P 500 itself (to calculate the market beta), and on a vector that contains the returns of the S&amp;P 500 when there are important tariff announcements, and 0 otherwise (to calculate the beta to tariff news). I used daily returns since the start of 2025.

I find that these stocks are the 10 stocks *most* sensitive to tariff news:

3,SMCI,Nvidia Will Continue Controlling The AI Board,"Nvidia is the 'queen' of the AI ecosystem, dominating hardware, software, and systems and controlling key segments from training to inference and networking.

Unmatched AI leadership, explosive revenue growth, and strategic partnerships with players like Astera Labs, Credo, and Super Micro Computer reinforce Nvidia's central role.

China market access and the Omniverse platform provide significant new growth drivers, supporting a strong 12-24 month growth outlook and a buy rating.

Despite high absolute valuation multiples, Nvidia's rapid growth and favorable PEG ratios make it attractive versus peers; the main risk is US-China geopolitical tension.

I believe these companies are well-positioned in the AI ecosystem, but I realise that one piece is missing: the queen. Just like in a game of chess, the queen is the most powerful and versatile piece on the board. It can move in any direction (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) and quickly cover a wide area. That is why I believe it is a perfect fit for NVIDIA (NVDA). I say this because it dominates both offensively and defensively. Just as the queen controls most of the board, NVDA controls the most valuable parts of the AI infrastructure, from training to inference, simulation, and networking. Secondly, it is versatile and critical because it spans hardware, software, and systems. This is cool because few participants can match its breadth and influence. Finally, it leverages strategic partnerships. I mean, just as the queen commands pawns, rooks, and bishops, NVDA integrates system builders (such as Super Micro Computer (SMCI)), connectivity providers (such as Credo Technology Group (CRDO) and Astera Labs (ALAB)), and government AI programmes to expand its control over the AI battlefield.

So why is the queen so special?

Well, several factors set Nvidia apart. First and foremost, it holds an unparalleled leadership position in the AI field, thanks to the combination of hardware, software, and ecosystem advantages. Its Blackwell GPU architecture makes it uniquely special. Combined with the Omniverse simulation platform, we are driving self-reinforcing AI, which is driving explosive growth. For example, in the first quarter of the 2026 fiscal year, NVDA achieved revenue of $44.1 billion, representing a year over year increase of 69%. Data centre revenue reached $39.1 billion, up 73%. Some of Nvidia's key customers such as Microsoft , Google  OpenAI, and Meta  deploy tens of thousands of Nvidia's latest GPUs each quarter. For example, according to SA Weebler Finance data, hyperscale data centre operators are running approximately 1,000 NVLink rack systems (about 72,000 GPUs) per week, with further increases expected. Ideally, this means Nvidia's data centre run rate in the AI computing sector has exceeded $170 billion annually.

Secondly, NVDA's stack is also expanding beyond GPUs. As I mentioned, its global industrial simulation platform is now being used to digitise entire factories and cities. In fact, the platform has evolved to support critical infrastructure. Original equipment manufacturers like BMW are running over 30 virtual factories on the platform to optimise production in advance. As each AI solution requires an increasing amount of synthetic training data, NVDA's end-to-end solutions form an unparalleled moat. Ideally, this platform means more users generating more simulation data, ultimately driving demand for more Nvidia computing resources. What I see is that NVDA is now at the centre of the AI value chain.

Finally, the U.S. has approved the resumption of exports of NVIDIA H20 AI GPUs to China. This means NVIDIA will be able to access China's potential market, which is significant. According to a Morgan Stanley report, China's AI market is expected to reach $1.4 trillion by 2030.

China has been systematically implementing a long-term strategy to build its domestic artificial intelligence capabilities. Its strong academic foundation, innovative methods, data, talent, and growing foreign investment are driving it toward becoming a leading artificial intelligence powerhouse...

‘...China is less concerned with building the most powerful AI capabilities and more focused on bringing AI to market. China embraces open-source AI, while the United States appears to be moving toward closed, tightly controlled AI systems...’

‘...The next 6 to 12 months will be a critical period for Chinese AI companies, as more and more deployments aimed at solving real-world problems begin to demonstrate productivity gains.’

Due to this milestone, NVDA's Jensen Huang estimates that NVDA's potential market size  in China will reach $50 billion. This means that China's spending on AI will increase, and Nvidia's growth prospects are expected to be stronger than ever before. I expect this growth outlook to be reflected in the upcoming quarterly earnings report to be released on 27 August 2025.

These factors combined will undoubtedly accelerate Nvidia's growth trajectory over the next 12 to 24 months. Therefore, I assign a ‘Buy’ rating to Nvidia Corporation.

Nvidia's AI Ecosystem

Having highlighted the case for NVDA, I would like to connect it to some AI components I have researched previously. Some of these AI companies have remarkable growth prospects and are expected to align their growth trajectories with NVDA. Additionally, the connections between NVDA and these AI companies will help us better understand NVDA's future direction.

First, Astera Labs  is a leading connectivity chip company that recently went public in 2024. ALAB's chips support scalable and low-latency GPU rack interconnects. For more information on Astera Labs and its chips, please refer to Article 1 and Article 2. Now, Nvidia has publicly announced its collaboration with Astera on NVLink Fusion. This collaboration expands NVDA's total addressable market (TAM).

There is also Credo Technology, which is known for its active cables  re-timers, and SerDes chips. According to SA Oakoff Investments, most hyperscale computing vendors now consider CRDO's AEC to be the de facto standard for in-rack links. This means that AEC cables are the infrastructure required for NVDA's 72-GPU Blackwell rack.

Third, Super Micro Computer  and Celestica  manufacture and sell GPU racks and systems using NVDA technology. Nvidia currently provides complete data centre racks containing tens of thousands of GPUs, which are delivered to system builders like SMCI and CLS. They then collaborate with NVDA to package and sell these racks to hyperscale customers such as Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon. For more information, please refer to this article from SMCI and this article from Celestica.

In summary, these partnerships demonstrate NVIDIA's connectivity within the AI ecosystem. This confirms that NVIDIA is indeed the queen of the AI chessboard.

For a company with a market capitalisation of 4.22 trillion dollars, it still has significant growth opportunities, particularly in the Chinese market, which means there is much to watch for with NVIDIA. Additionally, I note that NVIDIA has an A- growth rating, as shown in the figure below. The company's expected revenue growth rate is 60.71%, while the industry median is 7.28%. Furthermore, its 3-5 year compound annual growth rate  for expected long-term earnings per share  growth is 29.09%, compared to the industry median of 14.29%. This clearly indicates the expected growth levels for certain potential AI opportunities, such as the Omniverse platform and the Chinese AI market.

Now, when it comes to valuation, the growth outlook is becoming clearer. First, when I look at the chart below, I notice that most metrics are above the industry median, indicating that the valuation is higher than the industry median. Its non-GAAP forward price-to-earnings ratio is 40.12 times, and its forward enterprise value to EBITDA ratio is 34.79 times, both significantly higher than the industry median. However, when I look at the non-GAAP forward price-to-earnings ratio , it indicates that the valuation is undervalued by 27%. NVDA's price-to-earnings ratio is 1.38 times, while the industry median is 1.90 times. Based on the GAAP trailing 12-month PEG, the company's P/E ratio is 0.69 times, undervalued by 31% compared to the industry median. Ideally, I would say that most multiples look high in absolute terms, but compared to NVDA's 60.71% compound annual growth rate, the stock's valuation isn't as high as it appears.

In terms of peer comparison, I chose NVDA's closest competitors because Nvidia is already far ahead in terms of market capitalisation, so I chose Broadcom and AMD. I noticed that NVDA's price-to-earnings ratio and expected price-to-earnings ratio are still lower than its peers.

I believe that the biggest risk facing NVIDIA at present is geopolitical risk. Currently, there are many uncertainties between China and the United States, especially following the imposition of tariffs on Liberation Day and the U.S. government's decision to suspend exports of H20 GPUs to China. Such situations could recur and undermine NVIDIA's growth plans and market expansion efforts. Losing the Chinese market would have a significant impact on NVIDIA's business. Additionally, geopolitical events such as trade tariffs and sanctions could affect global supply or cloud computing spending in some of the key regions where NVIDIA operates. In conclusion, in this grand AI infrastructure game, NVIDIA is the queen. Currently, it is the most powerful and flexible piece on the board. Compared to peers that may occupy other key positions, NVIDIA controls every direction. For example, AMD is the rook, SMCI is the bishop, while Credo and Astera are agile knights. Ultimately, NVIDIA determines the pace and scope of this game. As AI demand continues to grow, NVIDIA's dominant position is further strengthened by the expansion of the Chinese market.",45,26,1753028984.0,2025-07-20T16:29:44+00:00,t3_1m4t8er,stocks,"Nvidia Will Continue Controlling The AI Board Nvidia is the 'queen' of the AI ecosystem, dominating hardware, software, and systems and controlling key segments from training to inference and networking.

\- talectrectinib (aka IBTROZI for the friends and family) just received full FDA approval (June 11 2025) for ROS1-positive non-small-cell lung cancer. Market reaction? Decent $NUVB grew by \~30% since then

And you know what's amazing? NUVB **trades around the low-single-digit dollar range** and currently has a market capitalisation of roughly **US $600 million**. I know, I know what a tiny one it is but she told me it's not the size that matters so we fine.

So we know that it trades at an historical low even after the run up post FDA so why the fuck should we invest in that shit?  
Incredible leadership. I mean look at this guy:

This isn't this guy first rodeo, he has been through it he previously built and sold Medivation (XTANDI®) to Pfizer even after a rough patch because of their phase 3 failure he was able to turn things around and bring a whopping 20x for its investors.

Not convinced yet? Look at the damn [CFO](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/philippe-sauvage). Yes he looks like a regard but he is a regard that been through it and his fucking name is Philippe Sauvage. Fuck if James Bond vilain doesn't make you want to invest, I don't know what will.

8,SMCI,Seeking portfolio optimization advice rolled over Ira,"
Hello,
I recently rolled over approximately $15,000 from my previous employer's 401(k) into a Fidelity IRA. My goal is to build a strong, long-term growth portfolio by evenly investing in stocks, with ongoing monthly contributions.
Here's my initial allocation breakdown for the $15,000:
 * Technology/Growth:
   * Microsoft (MSFT): $2000
   * Apple (AAPL): $2000
   * NVIDIA (NVDA): $1,500
   * Amazon (AMZN): $1,000
   * Palantir (PLTR): $1,000
   * Snowflake (SNOW): $1,000
   * Super Micro Computer (SMCI): $1,000
 * ETFs (Tech-Focused):
   * Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ): $1,500
   * VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH): $1,500
 * Consumer/Healthcare/Staples:
   * Visa (V): $750
   * Costco Wholesale (COST): $750
   * Procter &amp; Gamble (PG): $1,000
   * Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ): $1,000

My Objectives:
 * Long-term capital appreciation.
 * Diversification across promising sectors/companies.
 * Consistency with monthly contributions.
Questions for the Community:
 * Given my initial selections and goals, do you have any suggestions for optimizing this portfolio?
 * Are there any particular stocks you would add, remove, or adjust the weighting of?
 * Are there any sectors or types of companies I might be overlooking for a ""strong portfolio""?
Any insights or recommendations would be greatly appreciated as I look to build a robust investment foundation.
Thank you!

35,SMCI,Trump posted: ‘The stock market is at an all-time high and interest rates should be cut immediately’!,"Former U.S. President Donald Trump just posted heavy rhetoric on social media, praising tech, industrial stocks and cryptocurrencies for their big gains and strongly calling on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. Let's break down what he said and analyze the current state of the market with the latest data. Tech stocks, industrial stocks, Nasdaq hit record highs, cryptocurrencies “break through the sky” Nvidia (NVDA) is up 47% since the tariffs, the U.S. made hundreds of billions of dollars from the tariffs the country came back and called on the Fed to immediately cut interest rates declaring that “there is no inflation” .

How does the market interpret this?

Expectations for rate cuts are heating up: inflation is falling back + political heat is rising in a campaign year, Trump's statement may create some public pressure on the Fed (although its independence remains).

Tariffs negative turned positive? : Despite initial concerns that the market was under pressure, from the perspective of capital rotation, industrial, AI and defense stocks have risen, and it seems that the “Made in the USA” narrative is stronger.

Nvidia became a symbol: as the AI concept leader, NVDA after the tariffs rose against the trend, became the representative of the “no fear of policy uncertainty”, ARM, SMCI, AVGO, etc. also strengthened, the whole AI plate into the “revaluation period”.

Follow-up possible trend?

If the next Fed officials do not rush to suppress the rate cut expectations, the market may be the following scenarios

 Long beneficiary direction: tech giants (NVDA, MSFT, GOOGL), interest rate sensitive growth stocks (ARKK, SMH), industrial/infrastructure stocks (CAT, DE, GE)

Risks to watch out for: QQQ/SPY technicals are close to overheating, Powell or other officials release hawkish letters, earnings season is approaching, and there could be a “positive cash-out-on-decline” 

What do our Reddit friends think?

Do you think Trump is just “rubbing it in” or is the impact of his policies really being priced into the market?

All things considered, the portfolio is up $91,335 (+29.18%) on the year and up $139,161 (+52.47%) over the last 365 days. This is the overall profit and loss and includes options and all other account activity.

All options sold are backed by cash, shares, or LEAPS. I do not sell on margin, nor do I sell naked options.

All options and profits stay in the account with few exceptions. This is not my full time job, although I wish it was. I still grind on a 9-5. 

I contributed $600 this week, a 14 week contribution streak.

The portfolio is comprised of 89 unique tickers, down from 90 last week. These 89 tickers have a value of $384k. I also have 175 open option positions, up from 168 last week. The options have a total value of $20k. The total of the shares and options is $404k. The next goal on the “Road to” is $450k. 

I’m currently utilizing $38,200 in cash secured put collateral, up from $34,400 last week.

2025 &amp; 2026 &amp; 2027 LEAPS
In addition to the CSPs and covered calls, I purchase LEAPS. These act as collateral to sell covered calls against. You may have heard of poor man’s covered calls (PMCC). The LEAPS are up $13,863 this week and are up $131,575 overall.

See r/ExpiredOptions for a detailed spreadsheet update on all LEAPS positions including P/L for each individual position.

I am over $122k in total options premium, since 2021. I average $28.88 per option sold. I have sold over 4,200 options. I have been able to increase the premiums on an annual basis and I will attempt to keep this upward trend going forward. 


Strategy:
The underlying strategy is buy and hold. I also use simple 1-legged options to supplement that strategy. Options have somewhat of a learning curve, but I believe that most people can supplement their investments using simple options with careful risk management. 

I sell options on a weekly basis. I prefer cash secured puts and covered calls. Sometimes I’m ahead of the indexes and sometimes I’m behind. My goal is consistency in option premium revenue. I am building an income stream that will continue long into retirement.

Spreadsheets:
Unfortunately, I no longer provide spreadsheets. I received too many follow ups about formatting, pivot tables, compatibility etc.I think tracking is very important, but I post to discuss investing and options, not provide tech support for Excel. I appreciate the interest in my tracking methods, though. 

Commissions:
I use Robinhood as a broker and they do not charge commissions. There is a an industry standard regulation fee of $0.03 per contract. Last year I sold just over 1,400 contracts which is just over $40.00 in fees paid in 2024. In 2025, the contract fee is $0.04, which would push the fees up to around $60 based on current projections.  

The premiums have increased significantly as my experience has expanded over the last three years.

The stock trailed the S&amp;P 500, which registered a daily gain of 0.48%. At the same time, the Dow lost 0.02%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.94%.

Prior to today's trading, shares of the company had gained 43.51% outpaced the Finance sector's gain of 3.5% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 5.13%.

Investors will be eagerly watching for the performance of Oscar Health, Inc. in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company is predicted to post an EPS of $0.34, indicating a 70% growth compared to the equivalent quarter last year. Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $2.86 billion, indicating a 28.96% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year.

36,SMCI,"As a long term investor, how to strategize my exit plan (when to sell)?","I know when a company is at a bargain to buy. Problem is, I know when to buy, but I don’t know when to sell. Do I sell when I need the money or when doctor tells me I only got a month to live? 

Let me give you several examples:

I was able to buy lots of Celsius stocks at $8 basis in 2020 when I began trying their drinks, enjoyed it and began seeing Celsius drinks sold everywhere at grocery markets and convenience stores. I felt confident. Celsius rose all the way to $95, the stock split and dropped all the way back to $25. Obviously, I did not sell any.

Same thing applies to FSLY, SQ, SE when I did not sell at the peak and watched them drop all the way back to my entry price then I panic sold and only secured a very little gain.

SMCI - I also panic sold at $23.81 for small gain and obviously, watching the price going back up is lots of pain. 

I was able to buy lots of crowdstrike last year in July when the outage caused chaos within airport and various companies. I also scooped some UNH as well due to recent (to me, it’s overreaction) free fall. 

I bought lots of ASTS at $11 and sold at $30 to get my entry money back. Then it went all the way to $46. 

Lots of people say, if a stock gives you 25% to 50%, it makes sense for you to sell all, take the profit and run. It’s not true at all. If you sold NVDA, TSLA, AMD and PLTR at 30% gain, you probably cried yourself to sleep every night. Some of the companies do have ten-fold potential if you decide to hold long. And selling them also subject yourself to short term capital gain tax. 

Also, PLTR PE ratio skyrockets. I understand military contract and AI reliance are legit, but there’s no guarantee for price to hold. When is a good time to sell? Which companies have bright future to hold strong despite free fall? Nobody has a crystal ball I understand but does reading business financial statement and learning their fundamental/ business model/ ecological system gives you a clue? 

Market is at ATH carried by major techs due to AI replacing humans leading to boost in company’s profit margin and future earning potential. But correction will eventually come. 

I need investing veterans to give me some guidances here? Appreciate it!!

Some gains here and there, but I never lost big amounts of money. At some point I wanted to try daytrading because I got hyped by several posts on reddit flexing high gains in a short time.

Believe it or not, my goal was not to gamble. I spent many hours watching videos on technical analysis,, patterns etc. Even after that, I wasn't sure for myself and I tried some paid discord groups that offer calls because I assumed that ""they know better"". I will share my experience for those who have not tried. At least if you want to tray them anyway, you would know what to check about.

The posted photo is from a second account that tried options. The first account was for daytrading and went from 3.7k to 2k. Why the calls didn't work for me:

* Delayed signals. Let's say a call is to buy a share at 2.00$ and by the time they post it the price is 2.15$. You must know that these groups choose shares with high volatility in order to showcase big wins. But high volatility also mean big loses. I will come into this in a second. So there are two options, wait for a pullback and buy which is not guaranteed that the price will go up again, or buy at a higher price. Either way, the stock price can fall, they will say that the call was successful because they sold at profit and you lost money.
* For every successful trade, they have 3-4 failures. BUT, here comes the marketing. They will spam the successful trade all over the discord server, at the channel, at the ""daily review"", at social media, and they will literally burry the failed ones. I was following a guy that alerted SMCI and BBAI just before they had a big fall (about 40%). I didn't hear again about these two trades but in the meantime he repeatedly spammed a 30% win from another trade he did. I searched the history and I had to go 15 days back to see about the last post of the trades. Then I asked him in channel and said he was still holding. As of now, several months later, maybe he is still holding, he completely buried the trade.
* Here is a funny one. They make a call, If it goes up and they start spamming. 30%!! 50!! 100!! Then it instantly goes down 50% because as you remember, they trade very volatile stocks, and what do they say?? You should have sell!!! So, you see the catch here. If it continues going up, they will say look at this trade it's 500% up now. When it falls you are at fault because you should have secured profits. But that's why I'm paying for calls in the first place.
* Last but not least, they alert a call with SL. The SL is hit, and then the price goes up. And they continue as it never happened!! I believe that sometime they are just paper trading, I can't think of another reason.

As for the options account, I followed Flint. A trader that likes way OTM option calls with big potential gains, he has some good trades (I had 2 different trades that went from 20 to 60 per contract) but again, for every success he has 3-4 loses.

For these reasons, I wanted to warn you will love, because no one wants to lose money. I have decided to make trades myself, which is the hard way, but at the end I will learn something.  At least if I burn my new account it will be my fault and I will be in charge of my actions.

16,SMCI,One Stop Systems (OSS): The Overlooked Edge AI Defense Stock Powering Palantir’s (PLTR) Battlefield A,"
**Introduction and Thesis**

While AI software leaders like Palantir ($PLTR, ~$325B market cap) capture headlines, the specialized hardware enabling their platforms in mission-critical environments remains a significantly undervalued segment. This post presents an investment thesis for One Stop Systems ($OSS), a company with an ~$80M market cap (~$3/share) that builds the rugged, high-performance edge computers—the essential ""picks and shovels""—of the unfolding AI defense revolution.

The core thesis is that OSS presents a profound asymmetric risk/reward opportunity. It is a pure-play on the explosive growth of battlefield autonomy, yet trades at a microscopic fraction of its software peers. This analysis will detail verifiable, near-term catalysts and a strengthened leadership team as the foundation for a significant potential re-rating of the company's value.

---

**TL;DR: The Investment Case in Brief**

*   **The Problem:** Commercial-grade computers, even high-end ones, fail on the battlefield. Mission-critical AI requires immense local processing power (""at the edge"") that operates through extreme conditions without latency.
*   **OSS's Solution:** OSS designs military-grade supercomputers that bring data-center performance to tanks, drones, and warships, enabling real-time AI where it's needed most.
*   **Strengthened Leadership:** The recent appointment of CEO Mike Knowles, a former VP from the defense C5ISR sector (Cubic), brings deep industry experience to execute on the company's growth strategy.
*   **Verifiable Catalysts:**
    1.  **Potential $200M+ Sole-Source Contract:** OSS is the sole company selected for final **field testing** for a major U.S. Army program. A successful outcome would position them for a contract award valued at **~2.5x the company's entire current market cap**, with a final decision potentially announced soon.
    2.  **$1 Billion Sales Pipeline:** Management has confirmed a qualified pipeline exceeding $1 billion, indicating massive, long-term demand for their technology.
*   **Primary Source:** Both catalysts are detailed in the **[Official OSS Letter to Shareholders (PDF)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/b2icontent.irpass.cc/2595/rl144894.pdf#popup)**.
*   **The Asymmetry:** An ~$80M company that is a key technology enabler for a multi-trillion dollar industry undergoing a generational tech upgrade.

---

### **Why Edge Computing is Non-Negotiable: A Practical Scenario**

To understand OSS's moat, contrast its technology with a traditional data-center hardware provider like Super Micro ($SMCI) or TSS ($TSSI).

*   **Data Center / Cloud Approach (The SMCI/TSSI World):** Imagine a U.S. drone swarm on a reconnaissance mission. The lead drone detects a potential mobile missile launcher. To confirm the threat, it must stream high-definition video back to a ground station, which then relays it to a remote data center for analysis. **If the enemy jams that data link, the entire swarm is rendered blind and the mission fails.** The latency is too high, and the operational risk is unacceptable.
*   **Edge AI Approach (The OSS World):** Now, imagine each drone in that swarm is equipped with an OSS rugged computer. The lead drone uses **sensor fusion**—combining its optical, thermal, and radar data—and its onboard OSS supercomputer identifies the threat in milliseconds. It doesn't need to send video; it sends a tiny, encrypted data packet to the rest of the swarm: *""Hostile missile launcher at coordinates X,Y.""* **Even if the primary link to base is jammed, the swarm can autonomously react, adapt, and neutralize the threat.**

This is the OSS advantage: **resilience, security, and zero-latency decision-making.** They are not competing with data center players; they are enabling a completely different, more critical application of AI.

---

### **Evidence of Ecosystem Alignment: Serving the Same Customers**

The synergy between AI software and rugged hardware is not theoretical. Consider these two recent developments:

1.  **Palantir's Maritime AI:** Palantir and Hyundai recently unveiled the Tenebris, an Unmanned Surface Vessel powered by Palantir's AI. Such a platform fundamentally requires a rugged, onboard computer to run its autonomous systems.
    *   *Source:* [Naval News - Palantir Reveal Tenebris USV](https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2024/05/hd-hhi-and-palantir-reveal-tenebris-unmanned-surface-vessel/)

2.  **OSS's Maritime Design Win:** OSS announced a design win to provide the AI compute system for an autonomous maritime application for a major Asian defense contractor.
    *   *Source:* [GlobeNewswire - OSS Announces Maritime Design Win](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/12/03/2990581/0/en/OSS-Announces-Follow-On-Order-and-Design-Win-from-a-Leading-Defense-Contractor-in-Asia-for-an-Autonomous-Maritime-Application.html)

These announcements demonstrate that both companies are operating in parallel to solve the same problem for the same set of global defense customers. Investing in OSS is a bet on the entire trend of battlefield autonomy, not just a single software provider.

---

### **Strengthened Leadership to Execute on Growth**

A critical piece of the puzzle is leadership. In May 2024, OSS appointed Mike Knowles as CEO. Knowles isn't a generic tech executive; he joined from Cubic Corporation, where he was President of its C5ISR (Command, Control, Computers, Communications, Cyber, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance) division.

This means the person leading OSS has spent years selling advanced technology directly to the same military and defense contractor customers that make up OSS's target market. This significantly de-risks the ""execution"" aspect of converting their massive sales pipeline into revenue.

---

### **Catalysts for a Potential Re-rating**

**1. The Looming Transformative Contract Decision ($200M+)**
The U.S. Army has selected OSS as the **sole-source provider for final field testing** of the computing and storage hardware for a 360° situational awareness system for its armored vehicles. While the production contract is not yet awarded, being the exclusive company at this late stage is a powerful position. A successful validation is the final major hurdle before a **potential multi-year, $200M+ production contract is awarded.**

**2. The Validated $1 Billion Sales Pipeline**
The investor presentation confirms a pipeline of over $1 billion in potential deals. This isn't a theoretical market size; these are qualified programs in autonomous logistics, electronic warfare, and next-gen avionics that OSS is actively pursuing.

---

### **Valuation: The Path to a 100x Return**

The current market disconnect is stark.

| Company                    | Market Capitalization | Role in AI Defense                  |
|:---------------------------|:----------------------|:------------------------------------|
| Palantir ($PLTR)           | ~$325 Billion         | AI Software &amp; Platforms             |
| Anduril (Private)          | ~$30 Billion          | Integrated AI Systems &amp; Drones      |
| **One Stop Systems ($OSS)**  | **~$80 Million**      | **Essential Rugged AI Hardware**      |

A 100x return implies an $8 billion market cap. While ambitious, this is plausible in the long term for a company that becomes the ""Intel Inside"" for rugged AI hardware. To justify an $8B valuation (at a reasonable 8x Price-to-Sales), OSS would need ~$1B in annual revenue. The company's own **$1B+ qualified sales pipeline** shows that this isn't a fantasy; it's their stated roadmap of opportunity.

A simple 10x return—an $800M valuation—becomes highly plausible with the **successful award of the potential $200M+ contract.**

---

### **Identified Risks**

*   **Contract Award Risk:** The $200M+ Army program is the primary near-term catalyst. While OSS is in a strong position as the sole company in field testing, a failure to secure the final contract award would be a significant setback.
*   **Government Timelines:** Large defense contracts can have unpredictable ramp-up schedules and are subject to delays.
*   **Execution:** The new leadership team must successfully convert the pipeline into revenue.
*   **Micro-Cap Volatility:** The stock is subject to significant price swings and requires a long-term investment horizon.

---

### **Conclusion**

One Stop Systems offers a rare opportunity to invest in the foundational hardware layer of the AI defense boom at a compelling valuation. With new, deeply experienced leadership at the helm, a **potential transformative sole-source contract on the horizon**, and a validated $1B+ pipeline showing a clear path to exponential growth, OSS is at an inflection point.

The market has not yet priced in these realities. For investors who can see the critical link between AI software and the hardware that makes it viable, OSS represents a ground-floor opportunity.

*   **Edge AI Approach (The OSS World):** Now, imagine each drone in that swarm is equipped with an OSS rugged computer. The lead drone uses **sensor fusion**—combining its optical, thermal, and radar data—and its onboard OSS supercomputer identifies the threat in milliseconds. It doesn't need to send video; it sends a tiny, encrypted data packet to the rest of the swarm: *""Hostile missile launcher at coordinates X,Y.""* **Even if the primary link to base is jammed, the swarm can autonomously react, adapt, and neutralize the threat.**

This is the OSS advantage: **resilience, security, and zero-latency decision-making.** They are not competing with data center players; they are enabling a completely different, more critical application of AI.

### **Evidence of Ecosystem Alignment: Serving the Same Customers**

The synergy between AI software and rugged hardware is not theoretical. Consider these two recent developments:

1.  **Palantir's Maritime AI:** Palantir and Hyundai recently unveiled the Tenebris, an Unmanned Surface Vessel powered by Palantir's AI. Such a platform fundamentally requires a rugged, onboard computer to run its autonomous systems.
    *   *Source:* [Naval News - Palantir Reveal Tenebris USV](https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2024/05/hd-hhi-and-palantir-reveal-tenebris-unmanned-surface-vessel/)

2.  **OSS's Maritime Design Win:** OSS announced a design win to provide the AI compute system for an autonomous maritime application for a major Asian defense contractor.
    *   *Source:* [GlobeNewswire - OSS Announces Maritime Design Win](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/12/03/2990581/0/en/OSS-Announces-Follow-On-Order-and-Design-Win-from-a-Leading-Defense-Contractor-in-Asia-for-an-Autonomous-Maritime-Application.html)

These announcements demonstrate that both companies are operating in parallel to solve the same problem for the same set of global defense customers. Investing in OSS is a bet on the entire trend of battlefield autonomy, not just a single software provider.

---

### **Strengthened Leadership to Execute on Growth**

A critical piece of the puzzle is leadership. In May 2024, OSS appointed Mike Knowles as CEO. Knowles isn't a generic tech executive; he joined from Cubic Corporation, where he was President of its C5ISR (Command, Control, Computers, Communications, Cyber, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance) division.

This means the person leading OSS has spent years selling advanced technology directly to the same military and defense contractor customers that make up OSS's target market. This significantly de-risks the ""execution"" aspect of converting their massive sales pipeline into revenue.

---

### **Catalysts for a Potential Re-rating**

**1. The Looming Transformative Contract Decision ($200M+)**
The U.S. Army has selected OSS as the **sole-source provider for final field testing** of the computing and storage hardware for a 360° situational awareness system for its armored vehicles. While the production contract is not yet awarded, being the exclusive company at this late stage is a powerful position. A successful validation is the final major hurdle before a **potential multi-year, $200M+ production contract is awarded.**

**2. The Validated $1 Billion Sales Pipeline**
The investor presentation confirms a pipeline of over $1 billion in potential deals. This isn't a theoretical market size; these are qualified programs in autonomous logistics, electronic warfare, and next-gen avionics that OSS is actively pursuing.

---

### **Valuation: The Path to a 100x Return**

The current market disconnect is stark.

| Company                    | Market Capitalization | Role in AI Defense                  |
|:---------------------------|:----------------------|:------------------------------------|
| Palantir ($PLTR)           | ~$325 Billion         | AI Software &amp; Platforms             |
| Anduril (Private)          | ~$30 Billion          | Integrated AI Systems &amp; Drones      |
| **One Stop Systems ($OSS)**  | **~$80 Million**      | **Essential Rugged AI Hardware**      |

A 100x return implies an $8 billion market cap. While ambitious, this is plausible in the long term for a company that becomes the ""Intel Inside"" for rugged AI hardware. To justify an $8B valuation (at a reasonable 8x Price-to-Sales), OSS would need ~$1B in annual revenue. The company's own **$1B+ qualified sales pipeline** shows that this isn't a fantasy; it's their stated roadmap of opportunity.

A simple 10x return—an $800M valuation—becomes highly plausible with the **successful award of the potential $200M+ contract.**

---

### **Identified Risks**

*   **Contract Award Risk:** The $200M+ Army program is the primary near-term catalyst. While OSS is in a strong position as the sole company in field testing, a failure to secure the final contract award would be a significant setback.
*   **Government Timelines:** Large defense contracts can have unpredictable ramp-up schedules and are subject to delays.
*   **Execution:** The new leadership team must successfully convert the pipeline into revenue.
*   **Micro-Cap Volatility:** The stock is subject to significant price swings and requires a long-term investment horizon.

---

### **Conclusion**

One Stop Systems offers a rare opportunity to invest in the foundational hardware layer of the AI defense boom at a compelling valuation. With new, deeply experienced leadership at the helm, a **potential transformative sole-source contract on the horizon**, and a validated $1B+ pipeline showing a clear path to exponential growth, OSS is at an inflection point.

The market has not yet priced in these realities. For investors who can see the critical link between AI software and the hardware that makes it viable, OSS represents a ground-floor opportunity.

25,SMCI,Discovering Opportunities In “Superlongs”,"Before I begin, this is just a post to share my thoughts and potentially open some eyes to some solid opportunities in today’s market. This is not financial advice by any means.

So what is a superlong? It’s a term I use in regards to a stock that has been aggressively soaring for the last year with most trading days being green.

A few examples of superlongs are APP, SEZL, DAVE, SFM, TSSI, and PSIX, just to name a few.

Money can be made on each of these. The trend on these names is insanely strong and I doubt it comes to a halt anytime soon. Buying any of these now would likely make you a solid amount of money with a high confidence, but some of these are better than others.

If you find a superlong with the following criteria:

-Strong fundamentals
-Somewhat decent valuation 
-Nice chart
-Lucrative industry

Then you’ve found gold. Of these superlongs I’ve listed, only a few meet those criteria: SEZL, DAVE and PSIX. Additionally, these three have great charts, all breaking out and above all key moving averages. The issue with SEZL and DAVE is that they are perhaps quite stretched, so they may have intermediate pullbacks. Additionally, their valuations are only decent at best, with SEZL trading at 50x earnings and DAVE trading at 70x, these names may have already experienced most of their rally.

This leaves PSIX. PSIX trades at 13x earnings, way better than a “Somewhat decent valuation”. Industry average for what PSIX does is 26x, meaning it is pretty undervalued by that metric. Additionally, it has a measly 1B market cap, which is significantly easier to push higher than a superlong like APP with a 100B market cap. They also grew revenue by 40% and earnings by 170% in the last 12 months. Generally companies with that level of growth deserve way higher multiples than 13x, but I digress. Lastly, the chart looks phenomenal. It’s rallying above all key moving averages (the 8, 21, and 200dmas) and it recently took out its 52week high meaning it’s in breakout mode. (Also 8/21EMAs crossed recently)

This honestly feels like SMCI when it was at $4 (post split) back in 2022. SMCI at the time was trading at 12x earnings and growing aggressively. It wasn’t that they didn’t deserve a higher multiple, it was that NO ONE KNEW ABOUT THE STOCK. I believe that is the same case with PSIX

But most importantly, what does PSIX do?

They make and sell a wide variety of power solutions - it’s in the name. PSIX sells engines used in pumps, compressors, industrial equipment, trucks, busses to make up half of their revenue. The juicier other half comes from energy generation and data centers 👀 

Their energy solutions are a key component of data centers which are so hyped up by the market today. That fulfills the last bullet point of identifying opportunities in superlongs. PSIX has:

- Phenomenal fundamentals 
- Insanely cheap valuation
- Best chart I’ve seen in a while
- Lucrative industry exposure

The company is poised to continue growing. The stock is sitting at $50 a share and I think it goes to $70 sometime before August. Likely $100+ by end of year. Of all the superlongs to own, this is my favorite.

After week 23 the average premium per week is $1,100 with an annual projection of $57,175.

All things considered, the portfolio is up $54,892 (+17.45%) on the year and up $108,897 (+41.97% over the last 365 days. This is the overall profit and loss and includes options and all other account activity.

All options sold are backed by cash, shares, or LEAPS. I do not sell on margin, nor do I sell naked options.

All options and profits stay in the account with few exceptions. This is not my full time job, although I wish it was. I still grind on a 9-5. 

I contributed $600 this week, a 10 week contribution streak.

The portfolio is comprised of 91 unique tickers, down 1 from last week. These 91 tickers have a value of $333k. I also have 171 open option positions, up from 163 last week. The options have a total value of $35k. The total of the shares and options is $368k. The next goal on the “Road to” is $400k. 

I’m currently utilizing $30,600 in cash secured put collateral, down from $30,700 last week.

Strategy:
The underlying strategy is buy and hold. I also use simple 1-legged options to supplement that strategy. Options have somewhat of a learning curve, but I believe that most people can supplement their investments using simple options with careful risk management. 

I sell options on a weekly basis. I prefer cash secured puts and covered calls. Sometimes I’m ahead of the indexes and sometimes I’m behind. My goal is consistency in option premium revenue. I am building an income stream that will continue long into retirement.

Spreadsheets:
Unfortunately, I no longer provide spreadsheets. I received too many follow ups about formatting, pivot tables, compatibility etc.I think tracking is very important, but I post to discuss investing and options, not provide tech support for Excel. I appreciate the interest in my tracking methods, though. 

Commissions:
I use Robinhood as a broker and they do not charge commissions. There is a an industry standard regulation fee of $0.03 per contract. Last year I sold just over 1,400 contracts which is just over $40.00 in fees paid in 2024. In 2025, the contract fee is $0.04, which would push the fees up to around $60 based on current projections.

27,SMCI,What a UAE Deal Might Mean For SMCI,"This has been a pretty eventful week for SMCI and the AI sector as a whole. the acquisition of a [$20 billion deal](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/saudis-datavolt-signs-20bn-deal-with-supermicro/) with DataVolt in Saudi Arabia and a 39% jump in share price off the strength of the news and overall AI sentiment improving is enough to make any degen hard as solid veiny diamonds. One thing this week that has especially caught my eye is UAE's plan to construct a [5GW AI Campus](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2025/05/uae-and-us-presidents-attend-unveiling-phase-1-new-5gw-ai-campus-abu), with the help of G42, that will house 5GW worth of data center racks and span **10 square miles**.

To put this into perspective, thats:

* 50k 100kW full-scale liquid-cooled racks
* 3.2 **million** Nvidia Blackwell (B100) chips
* More power than NYC and San Francisco **combined**
* Equivalent to powering **3-4 million** homes or running **50 million** gaming PCs at full power 24/7

As you can see, this is an insanely ambitious feat the UAE is trying to achieve. Nonetheless, I couldn't help but ask myself, of the roughly 50k racks the UAE plans to procure, how many of those racks will be SMCI? Furthermore, whatever amount of racks SMCI does provide, how much money does SMCI stand to make from the project? Most importantly, What does that mean for the share price?

First, we need to understand what DCBBS is, and how it actually benefits customers with large scale projects like the UAE AI Campus.

DCBBS stands for **Direct Connect Backplane Building Block Solutions**, and it’s SMCI's proprietary system architecture for building **full AI racks,** not just individual servers. This means when a customer selects which AI rack configuration they want, when it arrives at their door, it comes in a form [like this](https://trendspider.com/blog/dell-and-super-micro-power-musks-ai-ambitions/). In other words, customers are getting Kitchen-Aid refrigerators sent to their fucking door that contain 30-90 Nvidia Blackwell chips and liquid cooling systems within them. No more receiving your SMCI rack order in individual server pieces that you have to assemble on your own. This greatly increases the speed in which these new data centers can go live. In most cases, these racks can be installed and plugged in in **under a day.**

Additionally, this also helps to increase their margins over time.

Traditionally, SMCI sold servers as modular building blocks. things like:

* 1U and 2U server chassis
* Motherboards
* Power supplies
* GPU trays

Customers (like system integrators, VARs, or hyperscalers) would assemble these into racks themselves. That’s low-margin business, because you’re selling parts, not solutions. the DCBBS racks contain:

* CPU &amp; GPU servers (e.g., Nvidia Blackwell, AMD EPYC, Intel Gaudi)
* Total liquid cooling (cold plates, manifolds, chillers, etc.)
* Network switches
* Rack management software
* Power distribution units (PDUs)

Why does this new model increase margins? Because it is a shift SMCI is making, from selling modular pieces that must be assembled, to selling complete solutions that are pre-assembled and ready for use upon arrival. This gives SMCI increased pricing power and in turn, increased margins. Below is a comparison table to illustrate the logic:

|Old Model (Per Server)|Rack-Scale Model (Per Rack)|
|:-|:-|
|Sell parts separately|Sell the full system integration|
|$5K–$15K ASP/server|$250K–$2M ASP per rack|
|6–10% gross margin|**15–25%+ gross margin**|
|Low-value add|**Turnkey AI solution** = premium pricing|

Now lets go more in depth:

**1. Higher Average Selling Price (ASP) per Unit**

* Traditional air-cooled servers sell for **$10K–$50K** each.
* Liquid-cooled **DCBBS racks** (often 64–96 GPUs) sell for **$2–5 million per rack**.
* Even if gross margins stay in the 8–10% range, **gross profit per rack is 40×–80× higher** than per-server sales.

Higher ASP = greater dollar-margin per unit sold, allowing SMCI to increase overall margins even with a similar percentage.

**2. Bundled Value = Control Over Margin Levers**

With DCBBS, SMCI is not just selling a server, it’s delivering:

* 8–12 liquid-cooled GPU servers
* 2000+ liquid-cooled racks a month
* Integrated CDUs (coolant distribution units)
* Power delivery + networking
* Cabling, plumbing, and chassis integration
* Software/BIOS optimization

All of these are designed, manufactured, and **assembled in-house**, which means:

1. Vertical integration reduces dependency on low-margin commodity components
2. Custom bundles let SMCI charge more for value-added services
3. Standardization improves yield, reduces warranty risk, and shortens labor cycles

**3. Faster Time-to-Deployment = Premium Pricing Power**

SMCI can ship **fully integrated, plug-and-play racks in 3–4 weeks**, while others take 8–12 weeks+ with multiple vendors.

For hyperscalers and AI startups racing to bring GPU clusters online, this **speed translates into willingness to pay more**, or at least not negotiate down.

For example: A customer buying a $2.5M rack from SMCI may avoid:

* Extra $500k/month in AI cloud rental costs
* 3–4 month delay in deploying AI training models
* Facility delays in retrofitting for traditional HVAC-based servers

Below is a table below comparing liquid-cooled racks Time-to-Deployment between SMCI and its competitors:

|**Vendor**|**Liquid-Cooled Rack Output (Est.)**|**Time to Deployment**|**Notes**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**SMCI**|**\~2,000+ racks/month**|**3–4 weeks** (from factory)|DCBBS fully integrated, scalable, Blackwell-ready|
|**Dell**|*Unknown (not disclosed)*|\~6–10 weeks (unverified)|IR7000 liquid-cooled racks for hyperscalers, but no output figures released|
|**HPE**|*Limited modular deployments*|\~8–12 weeks (pods)|Offers liquid-cooled AI systems (e.g. Cray EX, Apollo), but mostly for supercomputing clients|
|**Lenovo**|*Unknown*|6+ weeks (via FIS programs)|Neptune liquid cooling, but most integration is not turnkey at SMCI pace|

This “time-value” premium enhances margin per contract.

**4. Liquid Cooling = Lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for Clients**

Clients benefit from:

* 30–50%+ reduction in power usage (no fans/blowers at server level)
* Higher rack density → fewer racks → less real estate
* Reduced HVAC burden → capex + opex savings

Because DCBBS racks are pre-validated and ready for 80–100+ kW loads, customers can safely go denser per rack — which:

* Makes SMCI’s per-rack offering more economically valuable
* Lets them preserve pricing vs. air-cooled OEMs like Lenovo, HPE, or Dell, who may cut prices to remain competitive

Higher value-to-customer means more pricing power = higher gross margin

**5. Operational Efficiency at Scale**

SMCI is building out:

* A 3 million square foot manufacturing campus in Silicon Valley and Malaysia
* A supply chain optimized for GPU pre-allocation, liquid cooling parts, and just-in-time rack assembly

This allows SMCI to:

* Mass produce racks with minimal retooling
* Reduce per-rack cost at high volume
* Use contract-based repeat orders (like the DataVolt $20B deal) to plan capacity

Economies of scale + predictable assembly processes = declining cost/unit → rising margin

Below is a comparison table illustrating the margin impact:

|**Advantage**|**Margin Impact**|
|:-|:-|
|High ASP per rack|Higher gross profit in dollar terms|
|Bundled hardware/services|Increases perceived value + vertical profit|
|Speed to deploy (3-4 weeks)|Pricing premium vs. slower OEMs|
|Energy/cooling savings for customer|Improves TCO → preserves SMCI pricing power|
|Factory integration at scale|Lowers per-rack cost with volume|

So far, we've learned how DCBBS can substantially decrease build times for customers and how it could potentially increase margins for SMCI.

Now to the fun part: The UAE Deal

After doing some ape fisted carpet eating math, I estimate that the total cost of the 5GW AI Campus would be about $125 billion (assuming **each rack** draws about 100kW and sells for $2.5 million). Based on these numbers, I had ChatGPT build a table with a break down of what SMCI would get based on various percentages of the project they would be responsible for and superimposed a likelihood of occurrence formula in there:

|Coverage %|Likelihood of Occurrence|Racks Provided|G42 Total Payment to SMCI|Estimated Gross Profit (USD) 9.7%|Estimated EBITDA (USD)|Estimated EPS|Implied Share Price (@20x PE)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1%|Highly Likely (90%)|500|$1,250,000,000|$121,250,000|$103,062,500|$1.87|$37.40|

As you can see, even with a conservative PE of 20x and 9.7% margins, if SMCI gets even 2-5% of the project, thats an EPS of $3.75-9.37 and a share price of $75-187 a share.

**How ChatGPT Calculated the Likelihoods**

This wasn’t a statistical model but rather a strategic probability estimate based on 5 weighted factors:

**1. Historical Precedent (30%)**

* No hyperscaler or government has ever given 100% of a 5GW AI deployment to one vendor.
* Datavolt gave SMCI a $20B deal, but likely part of a larger multi-phase build — suggesting up to 25% is plausible.

**2. Industry Norm for Diversification (25%)**

* Large clients (e.g. AWS, G42, Meta) **split procurement across 2–4 OEMs** for risk mitigation, price leverage, and geopolitical hedging.
* Most national-scale AI campuses split rack-scale work among **Dell, Lenovo, HPE, SMCI, Nvidia integrators**, etc.

**3. SMCI Production Capacity (20%)**

* SMCI can output \~5,000 racks/month total, **2,000+ liquid cooled**.
* To hit 50–100% coverage of a 5GW facility, they’d need to commit 6–12 months of global capacity, which limits probability unless it's multi-year.

**4. Geopolitical Alignment (15%)**

* SMCI already has deep regional partnerships (Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi), so 10–25% is well within reach.
* But **50–100%** would likely require **exclusive national alignment**, which is rare unless the vendor is sovereign or majority-owned.

**5. First-Mover Advantage &amp; Time-to-Deploy (10%)**

* SMCI’s lead time (3–4 weeks vs. 8–12 weeks) is a massive advantage.
* For urgency-sensitive contracts, this could **justify awarding 25% or more** — but not 100%, barring a disruption in Dell/HPE supply.

I think its also important to add, two job listenings have been posted for positions in Abu Dhabi:

All in all, SMCI could stand to make a assload of money from a G42 UAE deal.

TL:DR: SMCI provides the fastest Time-to-Deployment of any of its competitors with its liquid-cooled DCBBS solution and this could help increase margins overtime and make it a more attractive buy to larger customers ready to deploy immediately. Capturing even 5% of the G42 UAE deal could result in a share price of $180+ a share. SMCI is already hiring for positions in Abu Dhabi.

",69,25,1747621323.0,2025-05-19T02:22:03+00:00,t3_1kq0ugj,wallstreetbets,"What a UAE Deal Might Mean For SMCI This has been a pretty eventful week for SMCI and the AI sector as a whole. the acquisition of a [$20 billion deal](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/saudis-datavolt-signs-20bn-deal-with-supermicro/) with DataVolt in Saudi Arabia and a 39% jump in share price off the strength of the news and overall AI sentiment improving is enough to make any degen hard as solid veiny diamonds. One thing this week that has especially caught my eye is UAE's plan to construct a [5GW AI Campus](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2025/05/uae-and-us-presidents-attend-unveiling-phase-1-new-5gw-ai-campus-abu), with the help of G42, that will house 5GW worth of data center racks and span **10 square miles**.

To put this into perspective, thats:

* 50k 100kW full-scale liquid-cooled racks
* 3.2 **million** Nvidia Blackwell (B100) chips
* More power than NYC and San Francisco **combined**
* Equivalent to powering **3-4 million** homes or running **50 million** gaming PCs at full power 24/7

As you can see, this is an insanely ambitious feat the UAE is trying to achieve. Nonetheless, I couldn't help but ask myself, of the roughly 50k racks the UAE plans to procure, how many of those racks will be SMCI? Furthermore, whatever amount of racks SMCI does provide, how much money does SMCI stand to make from the project? Most importantly, What does that mean for the share price?

First, we need to understand what DCBBS is, and how it actually benefits customers with large scale projects like the UAE AI Campus.

DCBBS stands for **Direct Connect Backplane Building Block Solutions**, and it’s SMCI's proprietary system architecture for building **full AI racks,** not just individual servers. This means when a customer selects which AI rack configuration they want, when it arrives at their door, it comes in a form [like this](https://trendspider.com/blog/dell-and-super-micro-power-musks-ai-ambitions/). In other words, customers are getting Kitchen-Aid refrigerators sent to their fucking door that contain 30-90 Nvidia Blackwell chips and liquid cooling systems within them. No more receiving your SMCI rack order in individual server pieces that you have to assemble on your own. This greatly increases the speed in which these new data centers can go live. In most cases, these racks can be installed and plugged in in **under a day.**

Additionally, this also helps to increase their margins over time.

Traditionally, SMCI sold servers as modular building blocks. things like:

* 1U and 2U server chassis
* Motherboards
* Power supplies
* GPU trays

Customers (like system integrators, VARs, or hyperscalers) would assemble these into racks themselves. That’s low-margin business, because you’re selling parts, not solutions. the DCBBS racks contain:

* CPU &amp; GPU servers (e.g., Nvidia Blackwell, AMD EPYC, Intel Gaudi)
* Total liquid cooling (cold plates, manifolds, chillers, etc.)
* Network switches
* Rack management software
* Power distribution units (PDUs)

Why does this new model increase margins? Because it is a shift SMCI is making, from selling modular pieces that must be assembled, to selling complete solutions that are pre-assembled and ready for use upon arrival. This gives SMCI increased pricing power and in turn, increased margins. Below is a comparison table to illustrate the logic:

|Old Model (Per Server)|Rack-Scale Model (Per Rack)|
|:-|:-|
|Sell parts separately|Sell the full system integration|
|$5K–$15K ASP/server|$250K–$2M ASP per rack|
|6–10% gross margin|**15–25%+ gross margin**|
|Low-value add|**Turnkey AI solution** = premium pricing|

Now lets go more in depth:

**1. Higher Average Selling Price (ASP) per Unit**

* Traditional air-cooled servers sell for **$10K–$50K** each.
* Liquid-cooled **DCBBS racks** (often 64–96 GPUs) sell for **$2–5 million per rack**.
* Even if gross margins stay in the 8–10% range, **gross profit per rack is 40×–80× higher** than per-server sales.

Higher ASP = greater dollar-margin per unit sold, allowing SMCI to increase overall margins even with a similar percentage.

**2. Bundled Value = Control Over Margin Levers**

With DCBBS, SMCI is not just selling a server, it’s delivering:

* 8–12 liquid-cooled GPU servers
* 2000+ liquid-cooled racks a month
* Integrated CDUs (coolant distribution units)
* Power delivery + networking
* Cabling, plumbing, and chassis integration
* Software/BIOS optimization

All of these are designed, manufactured, and **assembled in-house**, which means:

1. Vertical integration reduces dependency on low-margin commodity components
2. Custom bundles let SMCI charge more for value-added services
3. Standardization improves yield, reduces warranty risk, and shortens labor cycles

**3. Faster Time-to-Deployment = Premium Pricing Power**

SMCI can ship **fully integrated, plug-and-play racks in 3–4 weeks**, while others take 8–12 weeks+ with multiple vendors.

For hyperscalers and AI startups racing to bring GPU clusters online, this **speed translates into willingness to pay more**, or at least not negotiate down.

For example: A customer buying a $2.5M rack from SMCI may avoid:

* Extra $500k/month in AI cloud rental costs
* 3–4 month delay in deploying AI training models
* Facility delays in retrofitting for traditional HVAC-based servers

Below is a table below comparing liquid-cooled racks Time-to-Deployment between SMCI and its competitors:

|**Vendor**|**Liquid-Cooled Rack Output (Est.)**|**Time to Deployment**|**Notes**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**SMCI**|**\~2,000+ racks/month**|**3–4 weeks** (from factory)|DCBBS fully integrated, scalable, Blackwell-ready|
|**Dell**|*Unknown (not disclosed)*|\~6–10 weeks (unverified)|IR7000 liquid-cooled racks for hyperscalers, but no output figures released|
|**HPE**|*Limited modular deployments*|\~8–12 weeks (pods)|Offers liquid-cooled AI systems (e.g. Cray EX, Apollo), but mostly for supercomputing clients|
|**Lenovo**|*Unknown*|6+ weeks (via FIS programs)|Neptune liquid cooling, but most integration is not turnkey at SMCI pace|

This “time-value” premium enhances margin per contract.

**4. Liquid Cooling = Lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for Clients**

Clients benefit from:

* 30–50%+ reduction in power usage (no fans/blowers at server level)
* Higher rack density → fewer racks → less real estate
* Reduced HVAC burden → capex + opex savings

Because DCBBS racks are pre-validated and ready for 80–100+ kW loads, customers can safely go denser per rack — which:

* Makes SMCI’s per-rack offering more economically valuable
* Lets them preserve pricing vs. air-cooled OEMs like Lenovo, HPE, or Dell, who may cut prices to remain competitive

Higher value-to-customer means more pricing power = higher gross margin

**5. Operational Efficiency at Scale**

SMCI is building out:

* A 3 million square foot manufacturing campus in Silicon Valley and Malaysia
* A supply chain optimized for GPU pre-allocation, liquid cooling parts, and just-in-time rack assembly

This allows SMCI to:

* Mass produce racks with minimal retooling
* Reduce per-rack cost at high volume
* Use contract-based repeat orders (like the DataVolt $20B deal) to plan capacity

Economies of scale + predictable assembly processes = declining cost/unit → rising margin

Below is a comparison table illustrating the margin impact:

|**Advantage**|**Margin Impact**|
|:-|:-|
|High ASP per rack|Higher gross profit in dollar terms|
|Bundled hardware/services|Increases perceived value + vertical profit|
|Speed to deploy (3-4 weeks)|Pricing premium vs. slower OEMs|
|Energy/cooling savings for customer|Improves TCO → preserves SMCI pricing power|
|Factory integration at scale|Lowers per-rack cost with volume|

So far, we've learned how DCBBS can substantially decrease build times for customers and how it could potentially increase margins for SMCI.

Now to the fun part: The UAE Deal

After doing some ape fisted carpet eating math, I estimate that the total cost of the 5GW AI Campus would be about $125 billion (assuming **each rack** draws about 100kW and sells for $2.5 million). Based on these numbers, I had ChatGPT build a table with a break down of what SMCI would get based on various percentages of the project they would be responsible for and superimposed a likelihood of occurrence formula in there:

|Coverage %|Likelihood of Occurrence|Racks Provided|G42 Total Payment to SMCI|Estimated Gross Profit (USD) 9.7%|Estimated EBITDA (USD)|Estimated EPS|Implied Share Price (@20x PE)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|

* Large clients (e.g. AWS, G42, Meta) **split procurement across 2–4 OEMs** for risk mitigation, price leverage, and geopolitical hedging.
* Most national-scale AI campuses split rack-scale work among **Dell, Lenovo, HPE, SMCI, Nvidia integrators**, etc.

**3. SMCI Production Capacity (20%)**

* SMCI can output \~5,000 racks/month total, **2,000+ liquid cooled**.
* To hit 50–100% coverage of a 5GW facility, they’d need to commit 6–12 months of global capacity, which limits probability unless it's multi-year.

**4. Geopolitical Alignment (15%)**

* SMCI already has deep regional partnerships (Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi), so 10–25% is well within reach.
* But **50–100%** would likely require **exclusive national alignment**, which is rare unless the vendor is sovereign or majority-owned.

**5. First-Mover Advantage &amp; Time-to-Deploy (10%)**

* SMCI’s lead time (3–4 weeks vs. 8–12 weeks) is a massive advantage.
* For urgency-sensitive contracts, this could **justify awarding 25% or more** — but not 100%, barring a disruption in Dell/HPE supply.

I think its also important to add, two job listenings have been posted for positions in Abu Dhabi:

TL:DR: SMCI provides the fastest Time-to-Deployment of any of its competitors with its liquid-cooled DCBBS solution and this could help increase margins overtime and make it a more attractive buy to larger customers ready to deploy immediately. Capturing even 5% of the G42 UAE deal could result in a share price of $180+ a share. SMCI is already hiring for positions in Abu Dhabi.

Position: 15 $91c 1/16",14,7,1747620762.0,2025-05-19T02:12:42+00:00,t3_1kq0nuo,stocks,"What a UAE Deal Might Mean For SMCI This has been a pretty eventful week for SMCI and the AI sector as a whole. the acquisition of a [$20 billion deal](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/saudis-datavolt-signs-20bn-deal-with-supermicro/) with DataVolt in Saudi Arabia and a 39% jump in share price off the strength of the news and overall AI sentiment improving is enough to make any degen hard as solid veiny diamonds. One thing this week that has especially caught my eye is UAE's plan to construct a [5GW AI Campus](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2025/05/uae-and-us-presidents-attend-unveiling-phase-1-new-5gw-ai-campus-abu), with the help of G42, that will house 5GW worth of data center racks and span **10 square miles**.

To put this into perspective, thats:

* 50k 100kW full-scale liquid-cooled racks
* 3.2 **million** Nvidia Blackwell (B100) chips
* More power than NYC and San Francisco **combined**
* Equivalent to powering **3-4 million** homes or running **50 million** gaming PCs at full power 24/7

As you can see, this is an insanely ambitious feat the UAE is trying to achieve. Nonetheless, I couldn't help but ask myself, of the roughly 50k racks the UAE plans to procure, how many of those racks will be SMCI? Furthermore, whatever amount of racks SMCI does provide, how much money does SMCI stand to make from the project? Most importantly, What does that mean for the share price?

First, we need to understand what DCBBS is, and how it actually benefits customers with large scale projects like the UAE AI Campus.

DCBBS stands for **Direct Connect Backplane Building Block Solutions**, and it’s SMCI's proprietary system architecture for building **full AI racks,** not just individual servers. This means when a customer selects which AI rack configuration they want, when it arrives at their door, it comes in a form [like this](https://trendspider.com/blog/dell-and-super-micro-power-musks-ai-ambitions/). In other words, customers are getting Kitchen-Aid refrigerators sent to their fucking door that contain 30-90 Nvidia Blackwell chips and liquid cooling systems within them. No more receiving your SMCI rack order in individual server pieces that you have to assemble on your own. This greatly increases the speed in which these new data centers can go live. In most cases, these racks can be installed and plugged in in **under a day.**

Additionally, this also helps to increase their margins over time.

Traditionally, SMCI sold servers as modular building blocks. things like:

* 1U and 2U server chassis
* Motherboards
* Power supplies
* GPU trays

Customers (like system integrators, VARs, or hyperscalers) would assemble these into racks themselves. That’s low-margin business, because you’re selling parts, not solutions. the DCBBS racks contain:

* CPU &amp; GPU servers (e.g., Nvidia Blackwell, AMD EPYC, Intel Gaudi)
* Total liquid cooling (cold plates, manifolds, chillers, etc.)
* Network switches
* Rack management software
* Power distribution units (PDUs)

Why does this new model increase margins? Because it is a shift SMCI is making, from selling modular pieces that must be assembled, to selling complete solutions that are pre-assembled and ready for use upon arrival. This gives SMCI increased pricing power and in turn, increased margins. Below is a comparison table to illustrate the logic:

|Old Model (Per Server)|Rack-Scale Model (Per Rack)|
|:-|:-|
|Sell parts separately|Sell the full system integration|
|$5K–$15K ASP/server|$250K–$2M ASP per rack|
|6–10% gross margin|**15–25%+ gross margin**|
|Low-value add|**Turnkey AI solution** = premium pricing|

Now lets go more in depth:

**1. Higher Average Selling Price (ASP) per Unit**

* Traditional air-cooled servers sell for **$10K–$50K** each.
* Liquid-cooled **DCBBS racks** (often 64–96 GPUs) sell for **$2–5 million per rack**.
* Even if gross margins stay in the 8–10% range, **gross profit per rack is 40×–80× higher** than per-server sales.

Higher ASP = greater dollar-margin per unit sold, allowing SMCI to increase overall margins even with a similar percentage.

**2. Bundled Value = Control Over Margin Levers**

With DCBBS, SMCI is not just selling a server, it’s delivering:

* 8–12 liquid-cooled GPU servers
* 2000+ liquid-cooled racks a month
* Integrated CDUs (coolant distribution units)
* Power delivery + networking
* Cabling, plumbing, and chassis integration
* Software/BIOS optimization

All of these are designed, manufactured, and **assembled in-house**, which means:

1. Vertical integration reduces dependency on low-margin commodity components
2. Custom bundles let SMCI charge more for value-added services
3. Standardization improves yield, reduces warranty risk, and shortens labor cycles

**3. Faster Time-to-Deployment = Premium Pricing Power**

SMCI can ship **fully integrated, plug-and-play racks in 3–4 weeks**, while others take 8–12 weeks+ with multiple vendors.

For hyperscalers and AI startups racing to bring GPU clusters online, this **speed translates into willingness to pay more**, or at least not negotiate down.

For example: A customer buying a $2.5M rack from SMCI may avoid:

* Extra $500k/month in AI cloud rental costs
* 3–4 month delay in deploying AI training models
* Facility delays in retrofitting for traditional HVAC-based servers

Below is a table below comparing liquid-cooled racks Time-to-Deployment between SMCI and its competitors:

|**Vendor**|**Liquid-Cooled Rack Output (Est.)**|**Time to Deployment**|**Notes**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**SMCI**|**\~2,000+ racks/month**|**3–4 weeks** (from factory)|DCBBS fully integrated, scalable, Blackwell-ready|
|**Dell**|*Unknown (not disclosed)*|\~6–10 weeks (unverified)|IR7000 liquid-cooled racks for hyperscalers, but no output figures released|
|**HPE**|*Limited modular deployments*|\~8–12 weeks (pods)|Offers liquid-cooled AI systems (e.g. Cray EX, Apollo), but mostly for supercomputing clients|
|**Lenovo**|*Unknown*|6+ weeks (via FIS programs)|Neptune liquid cooling, but most integration is not turnkey at SMCI pace|

This “time-value” premium enhances margin per contract.

**4. Liquid Cooling = Lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for Clients**

Clients benefit from:

* 30–50%+ reduction in power usage (no fans/blowers at server level)
* Higher rack density → fewer racks → less real estate
* Reduced HVAC burden → capex + opex savings

Because DCBBS racks are pre-validated and ready for 80–100+ kW loads, customers can safely go denser per rack — which:

* Makes SMCI’s per-rack offering more economically valuable
* Lets them preserve pricing vs. air-cooled OEMs like Lenovo, HPE, or Dell, who may cut prices to remain competitive

Higher value-to-customer means more pricing power = higher gross margin

**5. Operational Efficiency at Scale**

SMCI is building out:

* A 3 million square foot manufacturing campus in Silicon Valley and Malaysia
* A supply chain optimized for GPU pre-allocation, liquid cooling parts, and just-in-time rack assembly

This allows SMCI to:

* Mass produce racks with minimal retooling
* Reduce per-rack cost at high volume
* Use contract-based repeat orders (like the DataVolt $20B deal) to plan capacity

Economies of scale + predictable assembly processes = declining cost/unit → rising margin

Below is a comparison table illustrating the margin impact:

|**Advantage**|**Margin Impact**|
|:-|:-|
|High ASP per rack|Higher gross profit in dollar terms|
|Bundled hardware/services|Increases perceived value + vertical profit|
|Speed to deploy (3-4 weeks)|Pricing premium vs. slower OEMs|
|Energy/cooling savings for customer|Improves TCO → preserves SMCI pricing power|
|Factory integration at scale|Lowers per-rack cost with volume|

So far, we've learned how DCBBS can substantially decrease build times for customers and how it could potentially increase margins for SMCI.

Now to the fun part: The UAE Deal

After doing some ape fisted carpet eating math, I estimate that the total cost of the 5GW AI Campus would be about $125 billion (assuming **each rack** draws about 100kW and sells for $2.5 million). Based on these numbers, I had ChatGPT build a table with a break down of what SMCI would get based on various percentages of the project they would be responsible for and superimposed a likelihood of occurrence formula in there:

|Coverage %|Likelihood of Occurrence|Racks Provided|G42 Total Payment to SMCI|Estimated Gross Profit (USD) 9.7%|Estimated EBITDA (USD)|Estimated EPS|Implied Share Price (@20x PE)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1%|Highly Likely (90%)|500|$1,250,000,000|$121,250,000|$103,062,500|$1.87|$37.40|
|2%|Very Likely (80%)|1000|$2,500,000,000|$242,500,000|$206,125,000|$3.75|$75.00|
|5%|Likely (65%)|2500|$6,250,000,000|$606,250,000|$515,312,500|$9.37|$187.40|
|10%|Possible (45%)|5000|$12,500,000,000|$1,212,500,000|$1,030,625,000|$18.74|$374.80|
|25%|Plausible (25%)|12500|$31,250,000,000|$3,031,250,000|$2,576,562,500|$46.84|$936.80|
|50%|Unlikely (10%)|25000|$62,500,000,000|$6,062,500,000|$5,153,125,000|$93.70|$1,874.00|
|100%|Very Unlikely (3%)|50000|$125,000,000,000|$12,125,000,000|$10,306,250,000|$187.40|$3,748.00|

As you can see, even with a conservative PE of 20x and 9.7% margins, if SMCI gets even 2-5% of the project, thats an EPS of $3.75-9.37 and a share price of $75-187 a share.

**How ChatGPT Calculated the Likelihoods**

This wasn’t a statistical model but rather a strategic probability estimate based on 5 weighted factors:

**1. Historical Precedent (30%)**

* No hyperscaler or government has ever given 100% of a 5GW AI deployment to one vendor.
* Datavolt gave SMCI a $20B deal, but likely part of a larger multi-phase build — suggesting up to 25% is plausible.

Last but not least, Cramer is [“Sick of”](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/jim-cramer-is-sick-of-super-micro-computer-stock-should-you-sell-smci-now/ar-AA1F0NkN?ocid=finance-verthp-feeds) SMCI

  
TL:DR: SMCI provides the fastest Time-to-Deployment of any of its competitors with its liquid-cooled DCBBS solution and this could help increase margins overtime and make it a more attractive buy to larger customers ready to deploy immediately. Capturing even 5% of the G42 UAE deal could result in a share price of $180+ a share. SMCI is already hiring for positions in Abu Dhabi.

Position: 15 $91c 1/16",3,0,1747620606.0,2025-05-19T02:10:06+00:00,t3_1kq0m2n,SmallStreetBets,"What a UAE Deal Might Mean For SMCI This has been a pretty eventful week for SMCI and the AI sector as a whole. the acquisition of a [$20 billion deal](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/saudis-datavolt-signs-20bn-deal-with-supermicro/) with DataVolt in Saudi Arabia and a 39% jump in share price off the strength of the news and overall AI sentiment improving is enough to make any degen hard as solid veiny diamonds. One thing this week that has especially caught my eye is UAE's plan to construct a [5GW AI Campus](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2025/05/uae-and-us-presidents-attend-unveiling-phase-1-new-5gw-ai-campus-abu), with the help of G42, that will house 5GW worth of data center racks and span **10 square miles**.

To put this into perspective, thats:

* 50k 100kW full-scale liquid-cooled racks
* 3.2 **million** Nvidia Blackwell (B100) chips
* More power than NYC and San Francisco **combined**
* Equivalent to powering **3-4 million** homes or running **50 million** gaming PCs at full power 24/7

As you can see, this is an insanely ambitious feat the UAE is trying to achieve. Nonetheless, I couldn't help but ask myself, of the roughly 50k racks the UAE plans to procure, how many of those racks will be SMCI? Furthermore, whatever amount of racks SMCI does provide, how much money does SMCI stand to make from the project? Most importantly, What does that mean for the share price?

First, we need to understand what DCBBS is, and how it actually benefits customers with large scale projects like the UAE AI Campus.

DCBBS stands for **Direct Connect Backplane Building Block Solutions**, and it’s SMCI's proprietary system architecture for building **full AI racks,** not just individual servers. This means when a customer selects which AI rack configuration they want, when it arrives at their door, it comes in a form [like this](https://trendspider.com/blog/dell-and-super-micro-power-musks-ai-ambitions/). In other words, customers are getting Kitchen-Aid refrigerators sent to their fucking door that contain 30-90 Nvidia Blackwell chips and liquid cooling systems within them. No more receiving your SMCI rack order in individual server pieces that you have to assemble on your own. This greatly increases the speed in which these new data centers can go live. In most cases, these racks can be installed and plugged in in **under a day.**

Additionally, this also helps to increase their margins over time.

Traditionally, SMCI sold servers as modular building blocks. things like:

* 1U and 2U server chassis
* Motherboards
* Power supplies
* GPU trays

Customers (like system integrators, VARs, or hyperscalers) would assemble these into racks themselves. That’s low-margin business, because you’re selling parts, not solutions. the DCBBS racks contain:

* CPU &amp; GPU servers (e.g., Nvidia Blackwell, AMD EPYC, Intel Gaudi)
* Total liquid cooling (cold plates, manifolds, chillers, etc.)
* Network switches
* Rack management software
* Power distribution units (PDUs)

Why does this new model increase margins? Because it is a shift SMCI is making, from selling modular pieces that must be assembled, to selling complete solutions that are pre-assembled and ready for use upon arrival. This gives SMCI increased pricing power and in turn, increased margins. Below is a comparison table to illustrate the logic:

|Old Model (Per Server)|Rack-Scale Model (Per Rack)|
|:-|:-|
|Sell parts separately|Sell the full system integration|
|$5K–$15K ASP/server|$250K–$2M ASP per rack|
|6–10% gross margin|**15–25%+ gross margin**|
|Low-value add|**Turnkey AI solution** = premium pricing|

Now lets go more in depth:

**1. Higher Average Selling Price (ASP) per Unit**

* Traditional air-cooled servers sell for **$10K–$50K** each.
* Liquid-cooled **DCBBS racks** (often 64–96 GPUs) sell for **$2–5 million per rack**.
* Even if gross margins stay in the 8–10% range, **gross profit per rack is 40×–80× higher** than per-server sales.

Higher ASP = greater dollar-margin per unit sold, allowing SMCI to increase overall margins even with a similar percentage.

**2. Bundled Value = Control Over Margin Levers**

With DCBBS, SMCI is not just selling a server, it’s delivering:

* 8–12 liquid-cooled GPU servers
* 2000+ liquid-cooled racks a month
* Integrated CDUs (coolant distribution units)
* Power delivery + networking
* Cabling, plumbing, and chassis integration
* Software/BIOS optimization

All of these are designed, manufactured, and **assembled in-house**, which means:

1. Vertical integration reduces dependency on low-margin commodity components
2. Custom bundles let SMCI charge more for value-added services
3. Standardization improves yield, reduces warranty risk, and shortens labor cycles

**3. Faster Time-to-Deployment = Premium Pricing Power**

SMCI can ship **fully integrated, plug-and-play racks in 3–4 weeks**, while others take 8–12 weeks+ with multiple vendors.

For hyperscalers and AI startups racing to bring GPU clusters online, this **speed translates into willingness to pay more**, or at least not negotiate down.

For example: A customer buying a $2.5M rack from SMCI may avoid:

* Extra $500k/month in AI cloud rental costs
* 3–4 month delay in deploying AI training models
* Facility delays in retrofitting for traditional HVAC-based servers

Below is a table below comparing liquid-cooled racks Time-to-Deployment between SMCI and its competitors:

|**Vendor**|**Liquid-Cooled Rack Output (Est.)**|**Time to Deployment**|**Notes**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**SMCI**|**\~2,000+ racks/month**|**3–4 weeks** (from factory)|DCBBS fully integrated, scalable, Blackwell-ready|
|**Dell**|*Unknown (not disclosed)*|\~6–10 weeks (unverified)|IR7000 liquid-cooled racks for hyperscalers, but no output figures released|
|**HPE**|*Limited modular deployments*|\~8–12 weeks (pods)|Offers liquid-cooled AI systems (e.g. Cray EX, Apollo), but mostly for supercomputing clients|
|**Lenovo**|*Unknown*|6+ weeks (via FIS programs)|Neptune liquid cooling, but most integration is not turnkey at SMCI pace|

This “time-value” premium enhances margin per contract.

**4. Liquid Cooling = Lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for Clients**

Clients benefit from:

* 30–50%+ reduction in power usage (no fans/blowers at server level)
* Higher rack density → fewer racks → less real estate
* Reduced HVAC burden → capex + opex savings

Because DCBBS racks are pre-validated and ready for 80–100+ kW loads, customers can safely go denser per rack — which:

* Makes SMCI’s per-rack offering more economically valuable
* Lets them preserve pricing vs. air-cooled OEMs like Lenovo, HPE, or Dell, who may cut prices to remain competitive

Higher value-to-customer means more pricing power = higher gross margin

**5. Operational Efficiency at Scale**

SMCI is building out:

* A 3 million square foot manufacturing campus in Silicon Valley and Malaysia
* A supply chain optimized for GPU pre-allocation, liquid cooling parts, and just-in-time rack assembly

This allows SMCI to:

* Mass produce racks with minimal retooling
* Reduce per-rack cost at high volume
* Use contract-based repeat orders (like the DataVolt $20B deal) to plan capacity

Economies of scale + predictable assembly processes = declining cost/unit → rising margin

Below is a comparison table illustrating the margin impact:

|**Advantage**|**Margin Impact**|
|:-|:-|
|High ASP per rack|Higher gross profit in dollar terms|
|Bundled hardware/services|Increases perceived value + vertical profit|
|Speed to deploy (3-4 weeks)|Pricing premium vs. slower OEMs|
|Energy/cooling savings for customer|Improves TCO → preserves SMCI pricing power|
|Factory integration at scale|Lowers per-rack cost with volume|

So far, we've learned how DCBBS can substantially decrease build times for customers and how it could potentially increase margins for SMCI.

Now to the fun part: The UAE Deal

After doing some ape fisted carpet eating math, I estimate that the total cost of the 5GW AI Campus would be about $125 billion (assuming **each rack** draws about 100kW and sells for $2.5 million). Based on these numbers, I had ChatGPT build a table with a break down of what SMCI would get based on various percentages of the project they would be responsible for and superimposed a likelihood of occurrence formula in there:

|Coverage %|Likelihood of Occurrence|Racks Provided|G42 Total Payment to SMCI|Estimated Gross Profit (USD) 9.7%|Estimated EBITDA (USD)|Estimated EPS|Implied Share Price (@20x PE)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1%|Highly Likely (90%)|500|$1,250,000,000|$121,250,000|$103,062,500|$1.87|$37.40|
|2%|Very Likely (80%)|1000|$2,500,000,000|$242,500,000|$206,125,000|$3.75|$75.00|
|5%|Likely (65%)|2500|$6,250,000,000|$606,250,000|$515,312,500|$9.37|$187.40|
|10%|Possible (45%)|5000|$12,500,000,000|$1,212,500,000|$1,030,625,000|$18.74|$374.80|
|25%|Plausible (25%)|12500|$31,250,000,000|$3,031,250,000|$2,576,562,500|$46.84|$936.80|
|50%|Unlikely (10%)|25000|$62,500,000,000|$6,062,500,000|$5,153,125,000|$93.70|$1,874.00|
|100%|Very Unlikely (3%)|50000|$125,000,000,000|$12,125,000,000|$10,306,250,000|$187.40|$3,748.00|

As you can see, even with a conservative PE of 20x and 9.7% margins, if SMCI gets even 2-5% of the project, thats an EPS of $3.75-9.37 and a share price of $75-187 a share.

**How ChatGPT Calculated the Likelihoods**

This wasn’t a statistical model but rather a strategic probability estimate based on 5 weighted factors:

**1. Historical Precedent (30%)**

* No hyperscaler or government has ever given 100% of a 5GW AI deployment to one vendor.
* Datavolt gave SMCI a $20B deal, but likely part of a larger multi-phase build — suggesting up to 25% is plausible.

**2. Industry Norm for Diversification (25%)**

* Large clients (e.g. AWS, G42, Meta) **split procurement across 2–4 OEMs** for risk mitigation, price leverage, and geopolitical hedging.
* Most national-scale AI campuses split rack-scale work among **Dell, Lenovo, HPE, SMCI, Nvidia integrators**, etc.

**3. SMCI Production Capacity (20%)**

* SMCI can output \~5,000 racks/month total, **2,000+ liquid cooled**.
* To hit 50–100% coverage of a 5GW facility, they’d need to commit 6–12 months of global capacity, which limits probability unless it's multi-year.

**4. Geopolitical Alignment (15%)**

* SMCI already has deep regional partnerships (Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi), so 10–25% is well within reach.
* But **50–100%** would likely require **exclusive national alignment**, which is rare unless the vendor is sovereign or majority-owned.

**5. First-Mover Advantage &amp; Time-to-Deploy (10%)**

* SMCI’s lead time (3–4 weeks vs. 8–12 weeks) is a massive advantage.
* For urgency-sensitive contracts, this could **justify awarding 25% or more** — but not 100%, barring a disruption in Dell/HPE supply.

I think its also important to add, two job listenings have been posted for positions in Abu Dhabi:

I use Robinhood as a broker and they do not charge commissions. There is a an industry standard regulation fee of $0.03 per contract. Last year I sold just over 1,400 contracts which is just over $40.00 in fees paid in 2024.

Also. Every time I buy Leap calls I am afraid to get into deep in the money and lose liquidity due to low volume. (Does it make sense?)

[**NVDA (Nvidia)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&amp;p=d)\- NVDA is set to ship 18,000 of its advanced GB300 Grace Blackwell AI chips to Saudi Arabia's Humain for a 500 MW data center project. Additionally, the Trump administration is considering a deal that would allow the UAE to purchase over a million NVDA AI chips, easing previous export restrictions. This caused NVDA to skyrocket 10 points yesterday, watching for additional momentum today. Interested if we can make an equivalent move today and if the trend is strong, might buy a little if so- note that NVDA has earnings on 5/28. Overall interesting that NVDA is finding sales outside of China, but not sure if the ME can make up the shortfall.

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&amp;p=d)\- TSLA has been on a tear ever since Musk has stepped away from DOGE, going from $275 -&gt; $340 in 5 days. Was watching this since $300, the next major level I'm watching is $350- considering how we exploded upwards after the election, not very enthusiastic to short this unless we go to stupidly high levels like $400+. So for now, biased long. Musk has been controversially politically but the stock performance did hinge on his presence at the company, so interested to see if this is going to blow everyone out of the water shorting it (eg me) like last time lol. 

[**UNH (UnitedHealth Group)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UNH&amp;p=d)\- UnitedHealth Group's CEO Andrew Witty has stepped down, and the company has suspended its 2025 forecast due to higher-than-expected medical costs, leading to a massive selloff yesterday. We dropped close to 70 points yesterday, I was personally hoping for the selloff to reach $300 but ultimately didn't get that far. Bought a little around $310 but will kick this out by selling calls against it because volatility is high. UNH has been through... a lot this year with Luigi and the CEO shooting, the proposed AI to analyze healthcare claims, and now this. We've fallen close to 40% after the *new* CEO stepped down as well. Expecting a small dead-cat bounce and a small slow recovery today, other than that not sure how they're going to navigate out of this.

[**SMCI (Supermicro)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SMCI&amp;p=d)\- Supermicro has announced a multi-year $20B partnership with Saudi data center firm DataVolt to deliver GPU platforms and cooling systems for AI campuses in Saudi Arabia and the United States. Made a pretty large 10 point move yesterday, and I want to see if we can make an equivalent move today to see if the trend is strong- interested in the $50 level.

[**AMD (Advanced Micro Devices)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMD&amp;p=d)\- Reported Q1 earnings with EPS of $0.62 vs. $0.61 expected and revenue of $5.47B vs. $5.46B expected. AMD mentioned a $1.5B revenue hit due to U.S. chip export restrictions to China, with $800M in costs linked to AI chip curbs. Overall pretty mixed results, stock spiked AH but gave back most of the gains, currently only up 1%. No particular level I'm watching. Overall I see less risk in this (and the other semis) now that most of the major chip companies (ARM reports today) have defined their losses due to the chip restriction- and we have clear defined numbers as to how much a stock will move if they're lifted. Obviously another bad catalyst would be completely stopping all exports, but that seems unlikely at this point.

[**DIS (Disney)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=DIS&amp;p=d)\- Reported Q2 EPS of $1.45 vs. $1.21 expected and revenue of $23.6B vs. $23.34B exp. Raised full-year EPS outlook to $5.75, +16% vs. prior guidance. Parks revenue grew 6% to $8.9B. Disney+ added 1.4M subs, hitting $336M in operating profit. I looked into the earnings and interestingly, I think profitability over raw subscriber growth was the spotlight in Disney+. Overall great earnings, which they capped off with softening international parks revenue, then followed it up with a park in Abu Dhabi (lol). Disneyworld generates roughly $10M a day in revenue, so it'll be interesting to see how much a park in Abu Dhabi will cost (10 times more?? /s)

[**SMCI (Super Micro Computer)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SMCI&amp;p=d)\- Issued weak guidance post-earnings, citing “economic uncertainty and tariff impacts.” EPS of 0.31 vs .50 exp, revenue of $4.60B vs. $5.42B expected. Ever since the spike back in February, this stock has essentially been (relatively) non-volatile, still watching $30 level. SMCI's server business is essentially linked to AI/data center build-outs- but this stock hasn't been moving that much with tech companies announcing greater AI spend. Accounting issues could return (highly unlikely), tariffs get worse, etc.

[**PLTR (Palantir Technologies)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PLTR&amp;p=d)\- Currently holding a short position due to the stock's massive run up to 125. Stop set at 115 (near yesterday’s high), earnings were released on Monday. I kind of see a similar pattern that came when NVDA was trading near $140 in this stock: (NVDA obviously has better fundamentals than PLTR) but we had a massive run up, earnings that were excellent but still couldn't live up to the hype, and a subsequent selloff. For now, nothing has really changed my mind about covering my short unless we have a massive turn. Government spending cuts are the main risk for the company.

And of course holding in an S&amp;P ETF growth fund, as well. I would rather take a guaranteed 10% gain even if it moves 12%, rather  than miss the 10% and it fall back to 1%.

# Stock Indices

# U.S. Markets

U.S. stock indices are experiencing notable declines today, reflecting investor concerns over recent economic data. The following table summarizes the performance of major U.S. indices based on current market data as of 11:47 AM PDT:

|Ticker|Description|Current Price|Previous Close (04/29/2025)|% Change|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|\^GSPC|S&amp;P 500|5499.44|5560.82|\-1.10%|
|\^DJI|Dow Jones Industrial Average|40290.41|40527.62|\-0.59%|
|\^IXIC|Nasdaq Composite|17101.67|17461.32|\-2.06%|
|\^RUT|Russell 2000|1950.07|1975.00|\-1.26%|

* **S&amp;P 500**: Down 1.10% to 5499.44, following a previous close of 5560.82. Over the past 10 trading days, it has gained 1.91% from 5396.63 on April 15, indicating short-term volatility but a modest upward trend.
* **Dow Jones**: Declined 0.59% to 40290.41, showing relative resilience compared to other indices.
* **Nasdaq Composite**: Experienced the steepest drop at 2.06%, reflecting sensitivity in technology-heavy sectors.
* **Russell 2000**: Down 1.26%, consistent with broader market caution.

News reports indicate that the S&amp;P 500’s decline is driven by weaker-than-expected U.S. economic growth data, raising recession fears. U.S. stock futures also dipped, and global stocks slumped, with European markets like the STOXX 600 seeing losses due to tariff-related uncertainties.

# Global Markets

* **Europe**: The Eurozone’s GDP beat forecasts in Q1, with Germany and France reporting modest growth (0.2% and slight growth, respectively). However, Germany faces rising unemployment, and France’s domestic demand remains stagnant. European indices like the FTSE 100 and DAX closed higher recently, but tariff concerns persist.
* **Asia**: China’s manufacturing PMI contracted sharply in April due to U.S. trade tensions, impacting global sentiment. Japan’s factory output fell more than expected in March, also due to tariffs. Asian markets showed mixed results, with Japan and Australia up, while India and Turkey were down.

# Currencies

The currency market shows relative stability with minor movements:

|Ticker|Description|Current Value|Previous Close (04/29/2025)|% Change|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|EURUSD=X|EUR/USD|1.1396|1.1386|\+0.09%|

* **EUR/USD**: Trading at 1.1396, up 0.09% from 1.1386. Over the past 10 trading days, it has fluctuated narrowly, moving from 1.1389 on April 16 to the current level, suggesting stability in the euro-dollar pair.
* **Context**: The slight dollar weakening may be linked to U.S. economic contraction and easing inflation pressures, as reported in economic news.

# Bonds

Bond yields are trending lower, signaling a flight to safety:

|Ticker|Description|Current Yield|Previous Close (04/29/2025)|Change (Basis Points)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|\^TNX|10-Year Treasury Note Yield|4.139%|4.173%|\-3.4|

* **10-Year Treasury Yield**: Decreased to 4.139% from 4.173%, a drop of 3.4 basis points. Over the past 10 days, it has declined from 4.323% on April 15, indicating rising bond prices as investors seek safer assets.
* **Implications**: The yield decline aligns with market uncertainty, as investors move away from riskier equities amid recession fears and trade tensions.

# Commodities

Commodity prices are under pressure, reflecting concerns about global demand:

|Ticker|Description|Current Price|Previous Close (04/29/2025)|% Change|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|GC=F|Gold Futures|3314.0|3329.5|\-0.47%|
|CL=F|Crude Oil Futures|59.72|60.27|\-0.91%|

* **Gold**: Trading at 3314.0, down 0.47% from 3329.5. Over the past 10 days, it has risen 2.0% from 3249.0 on April 11, suggesting a safe-haven appeal despite today’s dip.
* **Crude Oil**: Down 0.91% to 59.72 from 60.27. Over the past 10 days, it has fallen 2.94% from 61.53 on April 15, likely due to expected demand slowdowns amid economic contraction in the U.S. and China.
* **News Context**: U.S. crude oil inventories dropped unexpectedly, which could support prices, but global demand concerns dominate.

# Mortgage Rates

Mortgage rates remain elevated but show slight adjustments:

|Mortgage Type|Rate (04/30/2025)|Change from Previous Day|Change from Previous Week|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|30-Year Fixed|6.87%|\+0.01% (1 bp)|\-0.11% (-11 bp)|
|15-Year Fixed|5.94%|Unchanged|Unchanged|
|5-Year ARM|7.23%|\-0.06% (-6 bp)|N/A|

* **Analysis**: The 30-year fixed rate’s slight increase to 6.87% reflects ongoing high interest rate expectations, though the weekly decline suggests some relief. The surge in pending home sales, as reported in economic news, may be linked to this weekly drop, boosting housing market activity.
* **Implications**: High mortgage rates continue to challenge affordability, but stability in shorter-term rates like the 15-year fixed could support certain buyer segments.

# Economic and News Context

# U.S. Economic Indicators

* **GDP**: The U.S. economy contracted by 0.3% in Q1 2025, against expectations of growth, fueling recession fears.
* **Consumer Spending**: Slowed in Q1 but surged 0.7% in March, showing resilience.
* **Inflation**: The PCE price index rose 2.3% annually in March, with Core PCE flat, both below forecasts, suggesting easing inflationary pressures.
* **Employment**: Private payrolls and job openings missed expectations, indicating a labor market slowdown.
* **Manufacturing**: The Chicago PMI signaled contraction, aligning with global manufacturing challenges.
* **Housing**: Pending home sales saw the largest gain in over a year, potentially driven by lower weekly mortgage rates.

# Global Economic Indicators

* **Eurozone**: Q1 GDP exceeded forecasts, but a slowdown looms. Germany and France grew modestly, with challenges like unemployment and weak demand.
* **China**: Manufacturing PMI contracted sharply in April due to U.S. tariffs, with factory output falling at the fastest pace in 16 months.
* **Japan**: Factory output declined more than expected in March, impacted by trade tensions.
* **Other Regions**: Russia raised its 2025 budget deficit forecast, Brazil created fewer jobs than expected, and the UK saw a significant drop in house prices.

# News Highlights

* **Trade Tensions**: U.S. tariffs under President Trump are causing widespread uncertainty, affecting companies like Volvo and Logitech, and prompting EU contingency plans for Russia sanctions (Breaking News).
* **Corporate Earnings**: Mixed results with outperformances from Airbus and Barclays, but disappointments from Starbucks and Super Micro Computer (Stock Market News).
* **Market Sentiment**: Hedge funds sold European stocks heavily, and investor Mark Mobius holds 95% cash due to trade uncertainty, reflecting cautious sentiment.

# Futures Market

Futures provide insight into market expectations:

|Ticker|Description|Current Price|Context|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|ES=F|E-Mini S&amp;P 500 Jun 25|5555.75|Trading at a premium to the spot S&amp;P 500 (5499.44), suggesting optimism for June 2025.|

* **Analysis**: The premium in S&amp;P 500 futures indicates that despite today’s declines, investors anticipate recovery or growth by mid-2025, possibly driven by expected policy or economic stabilization.

# Conclusion

The financial markets on April 30, 2025, are characterized by caution, driven by a U.S. economic contraction, slowing employment, and global trade tensions. U.S. stock indices are down significantly, with the Nasdaq hit hardest, while Treasury yields and commodity prices reflect a shift toward safety and demand concerns. Bitcoin’s short-term dip contrasts with its longer-term gains, and mortgage rates remain high but stable, supporting some housing activity. Positive notes include Eurozone GDP growth and U.S. home sales, but the overall sentiment is wary. Investors should monitor economic data releases and trade policy developments closely, as these will likely shape market directions in the near term.",1,2,1746041424.0,2025-04-30T19:30:24+00:00,t3_1kbp59z,StockMarket,"Market Analysis Report: April 30, 2025, Mid Day As of 12:04 PM PDT on April 30, 2025, financial markets are navigating a complex landscape marked by economic uncertainty, trade tensions, and mixed global indicators.

[**SMCI (Super Micro Computer)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SMCI&amp;p=d)\- SMCI preannounced disappointing Q3 FY2025 results, with revenue expected between $4.5B–$4.6B vs. $5.5B expected, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.29–$0.31 vs. $0.54 expected. SMCI attributed the shortfall to delayed customer platform decisions and higher inventory reserves from older generation products. We're close to 20% down and with all the negative news on semi competition from China and server costs, I'm looking to play a bounce in this if the selloff gets worse. No real level I'm watching, likely will move with the market today. SMCI cited that inventory is increasing and as a result affected NVDA/DELL afterhours as well. DELL is down 6%! Potential supply chain disruptions like tariffs continue to be the biggest risk.

Jamie Dimon said that a recession is a ""best case scenario"", ultimately looking at how bad the selloff will be today.

[**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&amp;p=d)\- DeepSeek released its Prover-V2-671B model on Hugging Face, a 671B parameter AI model trained on Huawei’s Ascend 910B chips. Obviously bad if Deepseek can release a competitive model that wasn't built on NVDA's chips like last time. This was also affected by SMCI news, so I'm interested in this today if we near $100 near the open.

Daily active users reached 460 million, slightly above expectations. However, the company declined to provide Q2 guidance, citing macroeconomic uncertainties. Interested in this below $7, otherwise not interested mainly due to all the other things going on today. The digital advertising sector faces challenges due to changing trade policies and economic uncertainties, impacting revenue streams for advertising. Ultimately can be a huge loser if tariffs/recession goes through.

39,SMCI,US Economy Contracts for First Time Since 2022 on Imports Surge,"&gt;The US economy contracted at the start of the year for the first time since 2022 on a monumental pre-tariffs import surge and softer consumer spending, a first snapshot of the ripple effects from President Donald Trump’s trade policy.

&gt;Inflation-adjusted gross domestic product decreased an annualized 0.3% in the first quarter, well below average growth of about 3% in the prior two years, according to the government’s initial estimate published Wednesday. Net exports subtracted nearly 5 percentage points from GDP, the most on record, the Bureau of Economic Analysis report showed.

&gt;Consumer spending — which accounts for two-thirds of GDP — advanced at a 1.8% pace, the weakest since mid-2023. Business outlays for equipment, the lone bright spot in the report, increased an annualized 22.5%.

|Indicator|Actual|Estimate|
|:-|:-|:-|
|GDP|\-0.3%|\-0.2%|
|Personal consumption|\+1.8%|\+1.2%|
|PCE price index, excl. food, energy|\+3.5%|\+3.1%|

&gt;The GDP data highlight the scramble by companies to secure merchandise ahead of expansive tariffs. Looking ahead, many economists anticipate the higher duties will cause a supply shock, challenging businesses and leading to a pullback in demand as higher prices push cash-strapped Americans closer to the brink.

&gt;Forecasters currently see nearly even odds of the US falling into a recession in the next year. Consumers are also growing increasingly anxious that tariffs will take a toll on the labor market and drive up the cost of living.

&gt;The latest GDP figures showed imports surged an annualized about 41% — the biggest advance in nearly five years. Because these goods and services aren’t produced in the US, they are subtracted from GDP. Economists see the sharp widening of the trade deficit reversing in the second quarter.

&gt;Typically, imported merchandise moves into warehouses or directly to storefronts. However, the report showed business inventories contributed 2.25 percentage points to GDP during the quarter, the most since the end of 2021. The recent flood imports may instead show up in higher inventories in coming months and, along with a narrowing trade gap, provide a lift to second-quarter GDP.

&gt;Because swings in trade and inventories can sometimes distort overall GDP, economists prefer looking at final sales to private domestic purchasers for a better snapshot of demand. This measure increased at a 3% pace in the first quarter after rising an annualized 2.9% at the end of 2024.

&gt;Growth in consumer spending was driven by services and nondurable goods.

**My take:** As is commonly said, we haven't even begun to feel the effects of Trump's trade policy yet- shortages of products haven't begun hitting American consumers, but we're going to start feeling the effects this summer. We're likely in for a painful day in the markets today.

Biggest trend? **A ton of selling.**

* Darrell Issa dropped **$25–$50 million** in UBS trades.
* Dave McCormick unloading GS and PARA.
* Kevin Hern dumping Morgan Stanley debt.
* Treasury Bills showing up a lot too (hiding in safety?)



And on the flip side:

Some buys starting to pop up:

* Earl Leroy Carter and Marjorie Taylor Greene loading up on Treasuries.
* Ashley Moody picking up tech names (NVDA, SMCI).
* Dave McCormick nibbling on GIS and KBH.

**Bottom line:**

* Selling is still bigger than buying.
* Some are rotating into cash/Treasuries.
* Selective stock buying (especially in tech) is showing up, but not in huge size.

# Darrell Issa’s UBS Sale: Deleveraging or Rate Risk Repricing?

Wanted to call this out specifically because it’s sneaky important:  
Issa’s “sale” wasn’t just dumping stock, it was **getting out of four interest rate caps**.

These caps are basically insurance against rates spiking.  
By selling early (before maturity), it kinda suggests Issa thinks:

* Rate volatility might be calming down.
* Carrying the protection wasn’t worth it anymore.
* He's maybe expecting rates to stabilize or even drift lower.

Seems like someone deep in the political game is *less worried about rates blowing up from here*.

Biggest trend? **A ton of selling.**

* Darrell Issa dropped **$25–$50 million** in UBS trades.
* Dave McCormick unloading GS and PARA.
* Kevin Hern dumping Morgan Stanley debt.
* Treasury Bills showing up a lot too (hiding in safety?)



And on the flip side:

Some buys starting to pop up:

* Earl Leroy Carter and Marjorie Taylor Greene loading up on Treasuries.
* Ashley Moody picking up tech names (NVDA, SMCI).
* Dave McCormick nibbling on GIS and KBH.

**Bottom line:**

* Selling is still bigger than buying.
* Some are rotating into cash/Treasuries.
* Selective stock buying (especially in tech) is showing up, but not in huge size.

# Darrell Issa’s UBS Sale: Deleveraging or Rate Risk Repricing?

Wanted to call this out specifically because it’s sneaky important:  
Issa’s “sale” wasn’t just dumping stock, it was **getting out of four interest rate caps**.

These caps are basically insurance against rates spiking.  
By selling early (before maturity), it kinda suggests Issa thinks:

* Rate volatility might be calming down.
* Carrying the protection wasn’t worth it anymore.
* He's maybe expecting rates to stabilize or even drift lower.

Seems like someone deep in the political game is *less worried about rates blowing up from here*. Subtle move, but could matter a lot if you're thinking about the next few months.",0.07137918472290039,0.4592898190021515,0.4693309962749481,neutral,0.4693309962749481,-0.3879106342792511

Why are they always bundling SMCI and DELL together?
If SMCI is the market leader in liquid cooling and has the bleeding-edge tech for AI servers, why not just go all-in on them?

Is this a case of:

	•	Some kind of scale balancing? (SMCI = high-performance racks, Dell = standardization?)
	•	Risk mitigation by not going full SMCI?
	•	Or is there something SMCI doesn’t do well that Dell covers?

Just feels weird that the “AI Arms Race” giants are choosing both like it’s a power combo.

25,SMCI,"Week 13 $1,084 in premium","I will post a separate comment with a link to the detail behind each option sold this week.

After week 13 the average premium per week is $947 with an annual projection of $49,228.

All things considered, the portfolio is down $19,986 (-6.55%) on the year and up $33,154 (+13.25%) over the last 365 days. This is the overall profit and loss and includes options and all other account activity.

All options sold are backed by cash, shares, or LEAPS. I do not sell on margin, nor do I sell naked options.

I sell options on a weekly basis. I prefer cash secured puts and covered calls. Sometimes I’m ahead of the indexes and sometimes I’m behind. My goal is consistency in option premium revenue.

Turns out AWS (Amazon) and Azure (Microsoft) get their storage from major companies like:

Seagate (STX) and Western Digital (WDC) for traditional HDDs and SSDs.

Micron (MU) and Samsung for flash storage (NAND SSDs).

NVIDIA (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) for GPUs and CPUs powering AI workloads.  Nvidia obviously gets all the attention right now.

Arista Networks (ANET) and Broadcom (AVGO) for network hardware.

Supermicro (SMCI) for custom-built servers.

26,SMCI,"Week 11 -$2,553 in premium","I will post a separate comment with a link to the detail behind each option sold this week.

After week 11 the average premium per week is $914 with an annual projection of $47,405.

All things considered, the portfolio is down $1,132 (-0.38%) on the year and up $49,859 (+20.49%) over the last 365 days. This is the overall profit and loss and includes options and all other account activity.

All options sold are backed by cash, shares, or LEAPS. I do not sell on margin, nor do I sell naked options.

All options and profits stay in the account with few exceptions. This is not my full time job, although I wish it was. I still grind on a 9-5. 

I broke my streak of contributions three weeks ago. I will pick it up again in about two weeks. I am pausing the streak to evaluate a few things. Taxes are coming up and I am looking into a vehicle. I decided to hold off on the new vehicle and will not need to borrow from the portfolio. 
I will restart the road to $400k on Monday.

The portfolio is comprised of 96 unique tickers unchanged from last week. These 96 tickers have a value of $261k. I also have 161 open option positions, down from 163 last week. The options have a total value of $32k. The total of the shares and options is $293k. 

I’m currently utilizing $31,600 in cash secured put collateral, up from $30,300 last week.

I sell options on a weekly basis. I prefer cash secured puts and covered calls. Sometimes I’m ahead of the indexes and sometimes I’m behind. My goal is consistency in option premium revenue.

42,SMCI,AI trade simply out of juice or starting to deflate?,"The S&amp;P 500 has had a stellar run for the past couple of years, adding roughly $19T from the ChatGPT moment (Nov '22) to the DeepSeek event (Jan '25). I ran some back of the envelope calculations and, by my estimate, at least half of that is AI-driven!

By AI-driven, I’m referring to two key contributors:

1. First, the ""picks and shovels"" plays in AI data centers, which contributed $4.5 trillion (24% of the S&amp;P's gains), with NVDA leading the charge, accounting for 69% (nice) of this group's gains. While in my table I’ve focused on some of the major players in this space, it's likely I've left out many others, meaning these figures almost certainly underestimate the full impact.
2. Second, the rest of the Magnificent 7, which have benefited in various ways from the AI narrative, added an additional $5.2 trillion (27% of the S&amp;P's gains).

Now, the big question is: Is the AI trade simply losing some juice, or are we witnessing the start of a full-blown reversal? Since the DeepSeek event, these names have collectively shed $1.3 trillion, suggesting the latter might not be easily dismissed.

What does this mean for the S&amp;P going forward? The rest of the pack will have to pick up the slack if we are to see some gains this year, and that is without even considering the big R word.

Edit: figured out how to add the image.

85,SMCI,NETRAMARK - Revolution in medicine: This AI technology changes everything! — The quantum leap in medical data analysis,"The modern era has dawned! At breakneck speed, artificial intelligence models are penetrating all sectors of the economy. Business models that worked yesterday are disappearing from the market or being replaced by new ones. Data analysis now happens at lightning speed, with knowledge built over hundreds of years. The pharmaceutical industry is increasingly using artificial intelligence to make clinical trials more efficient and precise. AI is particularly effective in analyzing large amounts of medical data, recognizing patterns, and optimizing decision-making processes. The improvements in evaluation and interpretation are revolutionary. The Canadian technology company NetraMark Holdings Inc. (WKN: A3D5X9 | ISIN: CA64119M1059 | Ticker symbol: AIAI) is developing solutions for the pharmaceutical industry to use Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI). The results so far indicate a quantum leap. Meanwhile, NetraMark's market value is still in its infancy. Time is of the essence!

I**nvestment Highlights**

**NetraMark Holdings Inc (WKN: A3D5X9 | ISIN: CA64119M1059 | Ticker-Symbol: AIAI)**

* Combination of clinical trials in the biotech/pharma sector with generative AI
* Strong growth of the underlying market between 20 and 43% expected
* Implementation of AI models in research-relevant areas in line with requirements
* Significant enrichment of the life sciences sector through higher validation quality
* Strong share price performance within the known AI peer group of NASDAQ
* Significant growth potential in the medium term
* Still low market capitalization compared to investments made

**Recruitment and data analysis for clinical studies**

The pharmaceutical industry is increasingly using artificial intelligence (AI) to make clinical trials more efficient and precise. AI is particularly effective in data analysis, as it can analyze large amounts of medical data, recognize patterns, and optimize decision-making processes. AI can evaluate millions of patient data, laboratory values, and clinical reports in a few seconds. Automated pattern recognition identifies significant correlations that human analysts might overlook. Deep learning algorithms help to detect side effects and therapeutic successes at an early stage. AI searches electronic patient records to identify suitable study participants faster. So-called predictive models predict which patients are likely to respond best to a therapy. This reduces recruitment time, which is often a critical hurdle in clinical trials.

**Blockbuster potential: NetraMark is operating in a strong market with NetraAI 2.0**

(WKN: A3D5X9 | ISIN: CA64119M1059 | Ticker Symbol: AIAI | Frankfurt: 8TV)** is a leading artificial intelligence (AI) company transforming clinical trials in the pharmaceutical industry through the use of advanced data analytics. Last week, the Company announced the launch of NetraAI 2.0, a next-generation platform designed to improve clinical trial analytics. NetraAI 2.0 offers advanced features that help clinical trial sponsors gain valuable insights, refine endpoints, and optimize inclusion/exclusion criteria, thus setting the stage for successful trials in the regulatory phase. The pharmaceutical industry is already using a variety of AI models to optimize the development of new drugs, clinical trials, and patient care. Recent studies show that the market for artificial intelligence in clinical research is experiencing dynamic growth. In 2021, this sector had a turnover of approximately USD 1.3 billion, and this is expected to reach USD 5.6 billion by 2029. This corresponds to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.9 % per annum.

**According to** [**Mordorintelligence.com**](http://mordorintelligence.com/)**, the market size for AI in the pharmaceutical industry, in particular, is expected to grow from an estimated USD 3.05 billion in 2024 to approximately USD 18 billion by 2029.** An average growth rate (CAGR) of 42.7% can be achieved here. These figures illustrate AI's significant potential and growing importance in clinical research and healthcare. AI also helps conduct virtual clinical trials, dramatically reducing costs and mitigating ethical challenges.

**A New Era in Optimizing Clinical Trials**

**NetraAI 2.0 addresses one of the most pressing challenges in clinical research: striking a balance between efficacy and feasibility.** By transforming clinical trial data into actionable insights, the platform aims to improve decision-making and shorten study timelines. It provides streamlined reporting for decision-makers, and AI-powered reports prioritize the most important results and help continuously refine study strategies. This leads to agile decision-making and improved responsiveness. Validation levels are applied to identify truly robust clinical trial models. **By incorporating different clinical significance thresholds, the platform aims to provide nuanced interpretations of study results, ensuring alignment with pre-defined clinical objectives.** The study design can be optimized by identifying the most relevant patient subpopulations alongside causal variables to reduce recruitment challenges while maintaining statistical power and clinical significance.

Unlike other AI-based methods, NetraAI is designed to incorporate focus mechanisms that divide small data sets into explainable and unexplanable subsets. Unexplainable subgroups are collections of patients that may lead to suboptimal over-adjustment models and inaccurate insights due to poor correlations with the variables involved. NetraAI uses the explainable subsets to derive insights and hypotheses, including factors influencing treatment and placebo response, as well as adverse events, that have the potential to increase the chances of a clinical trial's success. Other AI methods lack these focusing mechanisms because they assign each patient to a class, even if this leads to “overfitting” in which important information is drowned out that could have been used to improve the chances of a study's success.

**Management Additions and Strategic Partnership**

**As previously announced on December 11, 2024, NetraMark has appointed Dr. Angelico Carta, co-founder of Worldwide Clinical Trials, as Chief Strategy Officer.** Dr. Carta has over 35 years of experience in clinical research and pharmaceutical strategy. He will focus on expanding partnerships and refining the software solutions' time to market. His leadership is expected to play a critical role in further developing NetraMark's AI-driven capabilities in clinical trials and precision medicine.

Concurrently, NetraMark has entered into a pilot collaboration agreement with a top-5 pharma company. The initiative aims to leverage NetraAI technology to generate new insights into patient populations and enhance the clients' development of treatments for autoimmune disorders. This collaboration is consistent with one of the Company's core objectives - to validate the technology through large collaborations and co-publishing opportunities.

**Full coffers for the next strategic round**

NetraMark strengthened its financial position in the first quarter of this fiscal year through the exercise of warrants and stock options by its holders. With net proceeds of over CAD 1.16 million, the further development and expansion of NetraMark's AI solutions are being advanced. The financing strengthens the Company's ability to scale operations and drive innovation in precision medicine. **Co-founder and CTO Dr. Joseph Geraci defines the target fields for the near future as follows:** ""*From the beginning, NetraAI was developed as a hub to improve the ability of machine intelligence and to understand patient subpopulations in clinical trials. As AI advances at an unprecedented rate, NetraAI 2.0 puts us in a unique position to push the boundaries of innovation and redefine how clinical trials are designed and understood*.""

Conclusion: The potential is enormous

After a quiet 2024, NetraMark's shares really took off from October onwards. The price rose from around CAD 0.20 to a peak of CAD 1.25, in line with the development of the latest AI solution, NetraAI. Now, in the first quarter, the Company is able to benefit from the positive sentiment in the high-tech sector. The NASDAQ 100 index has achieved a performance of 26% in the last 12 months, while the share of NetraMark (WKN: A3D5X9 | ISIN: CA64119M1059 | Ticker symbol: AIAI | Frankfurt: 8TV) has even outperformed with an increase of over 90%. Our peer group comparison includes prominent comparable stocks such as Nvdia, Super Micro Computer, and C3.Ai. In direct comparison, the CSE-listed stock NetraMark holds its own.

Over the last 12 months, NetraMark has been able to keep pace with the big players in the AI industry. Source: LSEG, as of 17.02.2025

**Given NetraAI's broad range of applications, a large area of activity within the biotech and pharmaceutical sector, and excellent peer group, we expect a rapid appreciation based on a current market capitalization of CAD 70 million.** With the rollout beginning and the current collaboration with a major pharmaceutical company, awareness of NetraMark's solutions should increase, leading to new customers and revenues. Thus, the current price of CAD 1.09 should be seen only as a temporary stop on the way to a fair valuation. The business model should gain significant momentum very quickly with further collaborations. Chart-wise, the price broke out in November 2024 with high volume, and since then, the new price level above CAD 1.00 has been significantly stabilized. The stock is also tradable in Frankfurt and Munich. **Risk-conscious investors now have an opportune entry point before the next blockbuster customer signs up for NetraMark's AI services.**

**Recruitment and data analysis for clinical studies**

The pharmaceutical industry is increasingly using artificial intelligence (AI) to make clinical trials more efficient and precise. AI is particularly effective in data analysis, as it can analyze large amounts of medical data, recognize patterns, and optimize decision-making processes. AI can evaluate millions of patient data, laboratory values, and clinical reports in a few seconds. Automated pattern recognition identifies significant correlations that human analysts might overlook. Deep learning algorithms help to detect side effects and therapeutic successes at an early stage. AI searches electronic patient records to identify suitable study participants faster. So-called predictive models predict which patients are likely to respond best to a therapy. This reduces recruitment time, which is often a critical hurdle in clinical trials.

I was invested in this company and made a decent amount of money off of them, until now. Probably slightly red after Thursday and ultimately selling Friday morning.  

After having watched the Athena lander try to land on Thursday morning, and watching my a reasonable amount of money die with it, it was a moment for reflection for this company, and really any others.  Some assumptions I made on LUNR and this landing:

1.) They learned from Odie, their failed moon landing attempt.  Intuitive Machines (IM) did learn, they upgraded cameras and other guidance systems.  They got within 400m of their landing sites on something hundreds of thousands of kilometres away! Impressive!

2.) These are literal rocket scientists and engineers, working with NASA and are probably ex-NASA engineers, should be a safe bet after point 1, right?

Learnings after getting hosed Thursday:

1.) Both 1 and 2 are correct.  Maybe I missed this, but where were their real world trials of this equipment? Why not try to use the same autonomous landing software with orbits around the earth where you have satellites to communicate with or literally watch with? Or use drones to watch with as it nears a landing destination here on Earth?  If there was any activity like this, I would have assumed it would be publicized to help the company stock and profile and also to support the government/private partnership they had, and would have made stock news outlets that I pay attention to; however, maybe I missed it?  The Earth has different gravity and an atmosphere, yes, but you could have tested the software here on Earth and recovered the unit that had dummy weights in it instead of a very expensive drill, a mass spectrometer, and a Nokia cellular network inside of it.

2.) During the landing viewing on Thursday, they mentioned setting up multiple lunar satellites around the moon to help with future missions... Why wouldn't you set those up first?  Seems like better smaller steps to guarantee these much larger, higher risk missions.  Yes, not as sexy as a landing, but probably small (but huge) milestones on the Gantt chart to bigger future missions.  

3.) Assuming #1/#2 to be true, and they had no real world test trials or other information to help aid the landing, did NASA, ultimately send all of their paid assets to the moon on largely unproven systems?  As an investor in the company (a very small investor), did I just do the same thing? 

Not hating on them, I want them to succeed, but it won't be with my money any longer.  I hope their contracts don't get cut by Elon/DOGE/etc that think this is a 'wasteful' program after now having two failed missions.  Afterall, other competitors landed successfully earlier in the week.  

In the current political climate, LUNR seems like a very risky bet at this point, and not an investment, unless there's some laying out of steps to guarantee future success.  Given that the federal government is largely their only source of revenue at this point, it's a massive question mark.  I'll probably invest in BUD instead at this point, they're on a tear since earning.  Even SMCI might be a better gamble.

1.) They learned from Odie, their failed moon landing attempt.  Intuitive Machines (IM) did learn, they upgraded cameras and other guidance systems.  They got within 400m of their landing sites on something hundreds of thousands of kilometres away! Impressive!

2.) These are literal rocket scientists and engineers, working with NASA and are probably ex-NASA engineers, should be a safe bet after point 1, right?

Learnings after getting hosed Thursday:

1.) Both 1 and 2 are correct.  Maybe I missed this, but where were their real world trials of this equipment? Why not try to use the same autonomous landing software with orbits around the earth where you have satellites to communicate with or literally watch with? Or use drones to watch with as it nears a landing destination here on Earth?  If there was any activity like this, I would have assumed it would be publicized to help the company stock and profile and also to support the government/private partnership they had, and would have made stock news outlets that I pay attention to; however, maybe I missed it?  The Earth has different gravity and an atmosphere, yes, but you could have tested the software here on Earth and recovered the unit that had dummy weights in it instead of a very expensive drill, a mass spectrometer, and a Nokia cellular network inside of it.

2.) During the landing viewing on Thursday, they mentioned setting up multiple lunar satellites around the moon to help with future missions... Why wouldn't you set those up first?  Seems like better smaller steps to guarantee these much larger, higher risk missions.  Yes, not as sexy as a landing, but probably small (but huge) milestones on the Gantt chart to bigger future missions.  

3.) Assuming #1/#2 to be true, and they had no real world test trials or other information to help aid the landing, did NASA, ultimately send all of their paid assets to the moon on largely unproven systems?  As an investor in the company (a very small investor), did I just do the same thing? 

Not hating on them, I want them to succeed, but it won't be with my money any longer.  I hope their contracts don't get cut by Elon/DOGE/etc that think this is a 'wasteful' program after now having two failed missions.  Afterall, other competitors landed successfully earlier in the week.  

In the current political climate, LUNR seems like a very risky bet at this point, and not an investment, unless there's some laying out of steps to guarantee future success.  Given that the federal government is largely their only source of revenue at this point, it's a massive question mark.  I'll probably invest in BUD instead at this point, they're on a tear since earning.  Even SMCI might be a better gamble.

Hear me out. 

Daily is struggling and is breaking back under an old downtrend it once had. 9ema is taking over the 21ema, and all indicators are down low. Oversold yes, but no sign of reversal yet. 

On the 2 hour chart we have an h forming. Very visible. Very much my go to these days with stocks dying. 

On the hourly (and tbh 2hour too) we got a descending triangle. A bearish sign.

35.66 to 34.53. My key range that needs to break down. And will be my trigger to enter puts. Probably won't swing cause you never know what could be tweeted over the weekend.

SMCI dip BUY or BYE?,"🔸 Salesforce (CRM): Q4 free cash flow up 31% YoY to $12.4B, AI-related ARR hits $900M (+120% YoY), and Agentforce transactions skyrocketed 24x in a single quarter to 5,000 deals. Yet, the stock dipped 4%+ post-earnings. Analysts see the pullback as a solid buying opp with valuation looking more attractive.

🔸 Home Depot (HD): Q4 revenue hit $39.7B (+14.1% YoY), beating by $638M, but the FY25 sales growth guidance of 2.8% missed expectations (3.4%). EPS forecast cut 2% to $14.94. With a stretched P/E of 25.2x, the stock faces 25% downside risk, and fair value could be around $285.16.

🔸 Hims &amp; Hers (HIMS): Stock tanked 25% over GLP-1 drug shortage fears, but let’s not ignore subscription growth of 269.49% since 2021 and FY25 revenue guidance of $2.3B-$2.4B, beating estimates. DCF model suggests fair value at $80—this one looks seriously undervalued.

🔸 Nvidia (NVDA): Q4 data center revenue now 91% of total (+93% YoY), free cash flow at $15.5B (+38% YoY), and FY26 Q1 revenue guidance of $43.0B (+65% YoY). Minor gross margin dip triggered some selling, but with a $50B buyback plan, long-term bulls have every reason to stay confident.

🔸 Rocket Lab (RKLB): Q4 revenue $132.4M (+120% YoY), but Neutron rocket launch delayed to late 2025, and Q1 revenue guidance of $120M (+29% YoY) came in light. Stock is down 12% post-earnings, with 10.4% short interest—bears are circling.

🔸 Super Micro Computer (SMCI): Stock bounced post-earnings, dodging Nasdaq delisting risks. But auditors flagged 5 internal control issues, plus ongoing SEC and DOJ investigations. That $40B FY27 revenue target? Yeah, investors are skeptical, and regulatory overhang is capping upside.

🔸 Snowflake (SNOW): Q4 net revenue retention at 126%, showing stronger customer stickiness. AI integration with Microsoft Azure is driving storage revenue to 11% of the mix, and operating margins could hit 8%. Stock is rebounding as the market bets big on its AI pivot.

🔸 Tempus AI: FY25 revenue expected at $1.24B (+79% YoY), Q4 oncology NGS tests hit 270.8K (single-test revenue +5% YoY), and genomics revenue up 30.6% YoY to $120.4M.

43,SMCI,When will you taste the 🌈,"1. Stocks with High Short Interest:

High short interest indicates that a substantial number of investors are betting against a company’s stock, anticipating a price decline. Notable examples include:
	•	Enphase Energy (ENPH): This solar company has attracted significant bearish bets due to challenges from Chinese competition and high interest rates.  ￼
	•	Super Micro Computer (SMCI): Known for its high short interest, indicating potential investor skepticism.  ￼
	•	Albemarle (ALB): A lithium producer facing considerable short interest, possibly due to concerns over lithium market dynamics.  ￼
	•	Fox Corporation (FOXA): The media company has seen increased short positions, suggesting bearish sentiment.  ￼
	•	Moderna (MRNA): Despite its role in COVID-19 vaccine development, Moderna has experienced significant short interest, potentially due to uncertainties about future revenue streams.  ￼

2. Companies with Recent Earnings Misses:

Missing earnings expectations can lead to negative investor sentiment and potential stock price declines. Recent examples include:
	•	Crawford &amp; Company B (CRD.B): Reported quarterly earnings of $0.19 per share, missing estimates of $0.24.  ￼
	•	Vistra (VST): Reported fourth-quarter earnings of $1.14 per share, significantly below the expected $2.17.  ￼
	•	Deere &amp; Company (DE): Reported a 30% decline in revenue and a 50% drop in net income for the first quarter of 2025 compared to the previous year.  ￼
	•	Okta (OKTA): Released earnings that fell short of expectations by $0.48 per share.  ￼

3. Sector-Specific Challenges:

Certain sectors are facing headwinds that could impact stock performance:
	•	Semiconductor Industry: Companies like Nvidia (NVDA) have experienced recent corrections, and upcoming earnings reports from Broadcom (AVGO) and Marvell Technology (MRVL) could influence investor sentiment in the AI and semiconductor space.  ￼
	•	Australian Energy Sector: Companies such as Boss Energy Ltd (BOE) and Paladin Energy Ltd (PDN) are among the most shorted ASX shares, indicating potential vulnerabilities.  ￼

I have kept a close eye on this subreddit for the last 10-15 years and have always been amazed by how ahead of the curve we are.

- Tesla 
- Shopify 
- Block
- NVDA 
- AMD 
- PLTR
- AAPL

I know everyone in the comments is going to claim this is selection bias, but I can assure you these stocks were talked about so much it is unmistakable. People will also claim but these stocks have tanked since then! They have had significant corrections, but if you bought them when the buzz began you are still significantly in the green.  We will have to wait and see what the future holds. 

 But what about the losers like movie pass!? Of course, some losers have been overly hyped too, but they are far less common. Also, in my opinion, the tone around stocks like movie pass is totally different than a stock like NVDA or SHOP. 

The beautiful part about Reddit is you hear both sides, SHOP had a great deal of resistance back in 2017 and still does. A lot of people claimed it was a worthless company. People like Andrew Left were worshipped for shorting the company. But at the end of the day it was posted about non stop and has performed extremely well. People were also screaming from the top of the mountain that NVDA was overpriced in 2017, look where that ended up. 

Lately it feels like we have entered a new “hype” cycle where a lot of new names have been heavily mentioned. Similar to the hype cycle of 2016-2017 there is a lot of resistance and great discussions behind had. Here are some new names that I have noticed being posted about non stop:

**Catalyst:** Some catalysts today: Deepseek cuts API pricing by 75%, NVDA is reporting earnings, ChatGPT is doing a limited rollout of ChatGPT 4.5, META considering $200B AI data center.

NVDA reporting earnings is the main catalyst today and decides the immediate direction of the market.

**Technicals:** Mainly interested in seeing if NVDA misses revenue (unlikely) or if they say anything significant due to new export controls which I talked about yesterday (strengthening of CHIPS Act export controls to China).

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** NVDA leads in semis design, is a multi-billion dollar company, etc.

**Risks:** I'm currently positioned defensively (sold calls against my position since I have a decent cost basis from back when DeepSeek news released, so overall will just sit on hands and get out of my position if the earnings are bad).

**Catalyst:** (Old news) New report shows demand is falling in Europe, with sales dropping a precipitous 45% in January.

**Technicals:** Massive selloff since post-election highs- $300 was a significant level I was watching at the time and we exploded past that, so interested to see if we're able to hold above it.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** BYD is a major competitor to TSLA and will likely overtake them in the future, and Musk's political actions are seen as controversial in Europe.

**Risks:** Musk.

**Catalyst:** The CC market is experiencing a selloff mainly due to proposed tariffs and the hack at Bybit, resulting in the loss of \~$1.5 billion.

**Technicals:** Not too interested in playing this long- still watching to see how we perform but the sell off has continued, waiting for a larger move still.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Hacks increase fear of storing on centralized exchanges (like Coinbase), proposed tariffs affecting digital assets can lead to market volatility. Interestingly enough, ByBit was (theorized) to be hacked by North Korea.

**Catalyst:** China plans to inject at least $55 billion into its largest banks in the coming months as part of a broader stimulus package, Yuan printer go brrrrr. This move is intended to supplement the core Tier 1 capital of China’s six largest state-owned banks. This is the first bank recapitalization since the global financial crisis. 10T yuan (\~$1.4T) debt package to support local government financing and economic stability.

**Technicals:** We've seen a decent upmove on a lot of Chinese stocks due to this, we'll see how the market reacts.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** China has been going through a spending crisis, and the government's decision to inject substantial capital into its major banks is a move to strengthen liquidity. This initiative aims to enhance the lending capacity of banks, support local government financing, and stabilize the broader economy. It's a (pre) bailout baby.

**Risks:** This does signal that China sees economic weakness, such as lack of demand due to their real estate sector they've traditionally leaned on for consumer growth/investment. Is this a long term fix? Who knows, but it worked for the US!

**Catalyst:** They finally filed! Really cutting it close there lol. The company has faced allegations of accounting irregularities. These allegations, along with a failure to file specific financial forms have been a plague for the past year on the stock price. 

**Technicals:** We've seen a 20% move AH, so worth watching at open to see if we move further. Other than that, watching $50/$55 level.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Was at threat of delisting from the NASDAQ but now they're safe baby.

**Risks:** People getting out, or the filing being rejected/advised to resubmit. The latter is a massive catalyst but low probability.

I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments.

The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

News: [China Plans To Start Bank Capital Hike With At Least 55 Billion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-26/china-plans-to-start-bank-capital-hike-with-at-least-55-billion)

**Catalyst:** Some catalysts today: Deepseek cuts API pricing by 75%, NVDA is reporting earnings, ChatGPT is doing a limited rollout of ChatGPT 4.5, META considering $200B AI data center.

NVDA reporting earnings is the main catalyst today and decides the immediate direction of the market.

**Technicals:** Mainly interested in seeing if NVDA misses revenue (unlikely) or if they say anything significant due to new export controls which I talked about yesterday (strengthening of CHIPS Act export controls to China).

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** NVDA leads in semis design, is a multi-billion dollar company, etc.

**Risks:** I'm currently positioned defensively (sold calls against my position since I have a decent cost basis from back when DeepSeek news released, so overall will just sit on hands and get out of my position if the earnings are bad).

**Related Tickers:** INTC, QCOM, ASML

**Ticker:** [**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&amp;p=d)

**Catalyst:** (Old news) New report shows demand is falling in Europe, with sales dropping a precipitous 45% in January.

**Technicals:** Massive selloff since post-election highs- $300 was a significant level I was watching at the time and we exploded past that, so interested to see if we're able to hold above it.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** BYD is a major competitor to TSLA and will likely overtake them in the future, and Musk's political actions are seen as controversial in Europe.

**Risks:** Musk.

**Related Tickers:** BYD, and other auto stocks.

**Ticker:** [**COIN (Coinbase)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=COIN&amp;p=d)**/**[**HOOD (Robinhood)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HOOD&amp;p=d)**/**[**MSTR (MicroStrategy)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MSTR&amp;p=d)**/Other CC Stocks**

**Catalyst:** The CC market is experiencing a selloff mainly due to proposed tariffs and the hack at Bybit, resulting in the loss of \~$1.5 billion.

**Technicals:** Not too interested in playing this long- still watching to see how we perform but the sell off has continued, waiting for a larger move still.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Hacks increase fear of storing on centralized exchanges (like Coinbase), proposed tariffs affecting digital assets can lead to market volatility. Interestingly enough, ByBit was (theorized) to be hacked by North Korea.

**Related Tickers:** MARA, RIOT

**Ticker:** [**BABA (Alibaba)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&amp;p=d)**/**[**FXI (iShares China Large-Cap ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FXI&amp;p=d)**/Chinese Stocks**

**Catalyst:** China plans to inject at least $55 billion into its largest banks in the coming months as part of a broader stimulus package, Yuan printer go brrrrr. This move is intended to supplement the core Tier 1 capital of China’s six largest state-owned banks. This is the first bank recapitalization since the global financial crisis. 10T yuan (\~$1.4T) debt package to support local government financing and economic stability.

**Technicals:** We've seen a decent upmove on a lot of Chinese stocks due to this, we'll see how the market reacts.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** China has been going through a spending crisis, and the government's decision to inject substantial capital into its major banks is a move to strengthen liquidity. This initiative aims to enhance the lending capacity of banks, support local government financing, and stabilize the broader economy. It's a (pre) bailout baby.

**Risks:** This does signal that China sees economic weakness, such as lack of demand due to their real estate sector they've traditionally leaned on for consumer growth/investment. Is this a long term fix? Who knows, but it worked for the US!

**Related Tickers:** JD, BIDU

**Ticker: SMCI**

**Catalyst:** They finally filed an hour before the deadline on the final day! Really cutting it close there lol. The company has faced allegations of accounting irregularities. These allegations, along with a failure to file specific financial forms have been a plague for the past year on the stock price. 

**Technicals:** We've seen a 20% move AH, so worth watching at open to see if we move further. Other than that, watching $50/$55 level. We'll see where it goes but worth noting that we've made a significant move back to pre-delisting threat prices already.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Was at threat of delisting from the NASDAQ but now they're safe baby.

**Risks:** People getting out, or the filing being rejected/advised to resubmit. The latter is a massive catalyst but low probability.

Earnings on Wednesday should be very interesting. Here’s a consolidated copy

Super Micro Lowers FY25 Revenue Guide, Pushes Back 30% Liquid Cooling Target


Super Micro recently reported preliminary fiscal Q2 results, in which it cut its fiscal 2025 revenue guide while hinting that Blackwell GPUs could take longer to ramp in the first part of the calendar year.

At Computex in June 2024, CEO Charles Liang stated that he “expects 15 percent of racks [SMCI] sells this year to use DLC, and 30 percent to employ it [in 2025].” In August 2024,  Liang slightly changed his tune, noting that they now expect “25% to 30% of the new global datacenter deployments to use DLC solutions in the next 12 months.”

I remember this comment well, as it was part of the evidence used to debunk the August rumors considering SMCI had moved up their timeline for DLC delivery (from end of year 2025 to mid-year 2025).

Two weeks ago in the February 2025 report, this timeline was shifted back with Liang stating that Super Micro now believes that “DLC or overall liquid cooling market share will grow all the way to 30% or even more in the next 12 months” -- it’s not a dramatic shift in tone but rather pushes the 30% target back from mid-year 2025 noted in August, to beyond the original year-end timeline --- to now technically being early 2026.

The August earnings call also housed one critical piece of information regarding Blackwell and Super Micro’s 2025 revenue. Wells Fargo’s Aaron Rakers questioned management about Blackwell and guidance for December 2024 and onwards. Liang explained that for the December quarter, Blackwell “will be very small. Engineering sample small volume. So the real volume, I believe, had to be March quarter next year. And that's why we foresee only $26 billion to $30 billion.”

But now, SMCI implied they are not able to ship Blackwell in the March quarter:

Super Micro has walked back the revenue guide that hinged on Blackwell’s NVL systems shipping in volume in the March quarter. Management was also quite clear that the new product was facing a delay as they await more GPU supply.

Vertiv Signals Softer Q1


Vertiv is a provider of thermal and power management solutions and is a leader in direct liquid cooling. The company stated they benefited from a “particularly strong” Q4, with revenue rising nearly 26% YoY as they overdelivered by nearly $200 million as customers wanted products as soon as possible.

Vertiv’s strength in Q4 may be tied to key partner Dell, as its AI server backlog in fiscal Q3 (October quarter) rose more than 18% QoQ to $4.5 billion after being flat QoQ in Q2, and its AI pipeline rising more than 50% QoQ. Analysts placed Dell’s AI server pipeline at $16 to $17 billion, up from $11 to $13 billion previously, a rather large jump for one quarter. However, Dell noted that one factor for its softer Q4 and fiscal year guide was the “unpredictability of the AI shipments” as there are “some more timing differences than what we were anticipating when we gave the guide the last quarter.”

For Q1, Vertiv guided a deceleration to 19% YoY growth, with FY25 revenue growth guided at 16%. Management defended this deceleration into Q1 by saying: “Now of course, Q4 was particularly strong. So we should not look at Q1 as a quarter-to-quarter, really look at the first quarter sales as the acceleration that has taken place. With a 19% organic growth in the first quarter, I feel very, very good about what that tells us about our overall trajectory” and also that it is “higher than what we actually saw in 2024.”

Liquid cooling capacity is not a constraint for Vertiv, as they had said last summer that they were “on track to finish in 2024 with a 45x capacity increase compared to baseline at the end of 2023.”

I agree with the analyst sentiment (and weak price action) following the report that the commentary doesn’t check out exactly. management is contradicting itself by guiding for organic growth of 19% at the midpoint for Q1 but 16% growth for the fiscal year (i.e., slower growth later in the year) while stating shipments will increase QoQ.

Additionally, the QoQ/YoY has to be looked at which is lower than what typical seasonality would account for, as our numbers indicate Vertiv was down (12.1%) due to seasonal sequential growth from Q4-Q1. This year, Vertiv is down (16.9%) from Q4-Q1.

My conclusion (still to be confirmed) is that Vertiv may see a weak Q2 before there is an acceleration into the back half.


Networking Companies Shift Tone on Timing for GB200s


PCIe 6.0 supplier:

PCIe 6.0 is a networking standard expected to initially ship with Nvidia’s Blackwell. A key supplier stated to expect this in the second half of the year, as these products “are driving higher dollar content opportunities [...] on a full rack and full accelerator basis and we expect volume deployments to begin in the second half of this year.”

Revealed at GTC in March of 2024, PCIe 6.0 was initially expected to launch with the GB200s. The following quote from this supplier also hints that merchant GPUs (Nvidia) will not be driving H1 – which would be odd if Blackwell was shipping. “Now, if you look into 2025, we see both contributing growth. The first half of the year will be more predominantly the internal AI accelerator programs. But if you get into the back half of the year, the transition on the merchant GPUs will also be very strong for us. This is where you'll see the custom rack configurations start to deploy and that’s where we see a big dollar increase in our contemporary GPU with [our product] starting to ramp.”

PMIC Suppliers:

PMICs (power management integrated circuits) are a critical part of the picture for Blackwell, given that these components were linked to Blackwell’s rumored power management issues. Major PMIC suppliers were unable to confirm volume shipments in the first quarter in recent earnings calls.

One PMIC supplier that we covered on our Advanced site on Feb 5th, is stating that “We know that we're not the only one players going after this, so the share is still to be determined. The final design, everything is still to be finalized as well, too. So we're working closely with the customer. Again, at this point, we can say that we're targeting for a mid-year launch.”

This company is either discussing Blackwell Ultra with the B300s, or they are implying GB200s are delayed.

The competing PMIC supplier stated: “Just to add a little bit of color to how we see the year rolling out, we believe that we will be off to a slower start in the first half of the year. But as the year develops, the customer base is expected to broaden as hyperscalers launch their new products. We have multiple product ramps with both existing customers as well as with these new hyperscalers.”

The takeaway is that neither PMIC supplier can confirm they are shipping in volume in Q1 or Q2, yet meanwhile, both are saying they are still part of the supply chain.

Semtech Suddenly Pulls Guidance on Active Copper Cabling (ACCs)


Perhaps the most drastic commentary to come out of the last few weeks was when a key supplier pulled its Q1 guidance intra-quarter.

Semtech filed an 8-K stating that “net sales from its CopperEdge products used in active copper cables are expected to be lower than the Company’s previously disclosed floor case estimate of $50 million due to rack architecture changes, with no expected ramp-up over the course of fiscal year 2026.”

ACC content had been estimated to be substantially higher with 36x2 configurations – it had been rumored back in October 2024 that Nvidia was halting development of one of the NVL72 configurations, the NVL36x2, which linked two 36 GPU racks together in a side-by-side system. Semtech pulling guidance strengthens this view.

The shift in architecture to discontinue the 36x2 configuration was said to possibly “disrupt the supply chain for assembly and cooling solutions,” by removing dual-rack configurations and focusing solely on single-rack NVL72 and NVL36 configurations. DLC suppliers have been pushing back Blackwell’s ramp later in the year, suggesting that the market may have faced some impacts from this rumored design change late last year.

While shifting architectures is not a big deal in the medium-term (as stated above, NVL72 single rack configurations are expected to see a higher mix); it’s the suddenness that Semtech pulled it’s guidance that is cause for concern as the company had reaffirmed its optimistic revenue floor guidance  based on two factors – the timing of Blackwell’s launch and changes in rack design. This suggests both factors may be in play, as a late-stage design change was expected to have downstream impacts on timing for DLC ramping.

Conclusion:
Given market jitters around DeepSeek, which turned out to be a non-issue, something more material related to the GB200s, such as growth slowing below expectations at the start of the new fiscal year, could send the stock below $100 -- which we would see as a buying opportunity.

There is a scenario where Nvidia’s stock marches higher – perhaps based on the remaining strength from Hopper and the B200s, B200 HGX systems and B200As packaged with CoWoS-S and having a lower thermal design power (TDP). Or perhaps the string of suppliers discussed here are simply stating the GB200s are not ramping in volume in Q1 but will in Q2.",128,52,1740329696.0,2025-02-23T16:54:56+00:00,t3_1iweku5,stocks,"Nvidia Suppliers Send Mixed Signals for Delays on GB200 Systems – What It Means for NVDA Stock Recently Analyst Beth Kindig, a bullish analyst, put out an interesting newsletter that was surprisingly bearish on Nvidia due to their supplier commentary.

A key supplier stated to expect this in the second half of the year, as these products “are driving higher dollar content opportunities [...] on a full rack and full accelerator basis and we expect volume deployments to begin in the second half of this year.”

Revealed at GTC in March of 2024, PCIe 6.0 was initially expected to launch with the GB200s. The following quote from this supplier also hints that merchant GPUs (Nvidia) will not be driving H1 – which would be odd if Blackwell was shipping. “Now, if you look into 2025, we see both contributing growth. The first half of the year will be more predominantly the internal AI accelerator programs. But if you get into the back half of the year, the transition on the merchant GPUs will also be very strong for us. This is where you'll see the custom rack configurations start to deploy and that’s where we see a big dollar increase in our contemporary GPU with [our product] starting to ramp.”

PMIC Suppliers:

PMICs (power management integrated circuits) are a critical part of the picture for Blackwell, given that these components were linked to Blackwell’s rumored power management issues. Major PMIC suppliers were unable to confirm volume shipments in the first quarter in recent earnings calls.

One PMIC supplier that we covered on our Advanced site on Feb 5th, is stating that “We know that we're not the only one players going after this, so the share is still to be determined. The final design, everything is still to be finalized as well, too. So we're working closely with the customer. Again, at this point, we can say that we're targeting for a mid-year launch.”

This company is either discussing Blackwell Ultra with the B300s, or they are implying GB200s are delayed.

The competing PMIC supplier stated: “Just to add a little bit of color to how we see the year rolling out, we believe that we will be off to a slower start in the first half of the year. But as the year develops, the customer base is expected to broaden as hyperscalers launch their new products. We have multiple product ramps with both existing customers as well as with these new hyperscalers.”

The takeaway is that neither PMIC supplier can confirm they are shipping in volume in Q1 or Q2, yet meanwhile, both are saying they are still part of the supply chain.

Semtech Suddenly Pulls Guidance on Active Copper Cabling (ACCs)


Perhaps the most drastic commentary to come out of the last few weeks was when a key supplier pulled its Q1 guidance intra-quarter.

Semtech filed an 8-K stating that “net sales from its CopperEdge products used in active copper cables are expected to be lower than the Company’s previously disclosed floor case estimate of $50 million due to rack architecture changes, with no expected ramp-up over the course of fiscal year 2026.”

ACC content had been estimated to be substantially higher with 36x2 configurations – it had been rumored back in October 2024 that Nvidia was halting development of one of the NVL72 configurations, the NVL36x2, which linked two 36 GPU racks together in a side-by-side system. Semtech pulling guidance strengthens this view.

The shift in architecture to discontinue the 36x2 configuration was said to possibly “disrupt the supply chain for assembly and cooling solutions,” by removing dual-rack configurations and focusing solely on single-rack NVL72 and NVL36 configurations. DLC suppliers have been pushing back Blackwell’s ramp later in the year, suggesting that the market may have faced some impacts from this rumored design change late last year.

While shifting architectures is not a big deal in the medium-term (as stated above, NVL72 single rack configurations are expected to see a higher mix); it’s the suddenness that Semtech pulled it’s guidance that is cause for concern as the company had reaffirmed its optimistic revenue floor guidance  based on two factors – the timing of Blackwell’s launch and changes in rack design. This suggests both factors may be in play, as a late-stage design change was expected to have downstream impacts on timing for DLC ramping.

Conclusion:
Given market jitters around DeepSeek, which turned out to be a non-issue, something more material related to the GB200s, such as growth slowing below expectations at the start of the new fiscal year, could send the stock below $100 -- which we would see as a buying opportunity.

There is a scenario where Nvidia’s stock marches higher – perhaps based on the remaining strength from Hopper and the B200s, B200 HGX systems and B200As packaged with CoWoS-S and having a lower thermal design power (TDP). Or perhaps the string of suppliers discussed here are simply stating the GB200s are not ramping in volume in Q1 but will in Q2.",0.15947389602661133,0.15776917338371277,0.6827569007873535,neutral,0.6827569007873535,0.0017047226428985596

Feb 21 - Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI, Financial) performs a strategic move by issuing $700 million in convertible senior notes. Super Micro Computer finalized the 2.25% convertible senior notes due 2028 with unsecured maturity on July 15, 2028, though the notes become redeemable before term through redemption or conversion or sukuk repurchase. Interest payments for the notes will begin in the first half of July 2025. Super Micro Computer Inc. intends to allocate the funds generated from its $700 million note issuance for corporate expenses, which include building operational working capital to sustain future growth initiatives.

The notes provide noteholders with the option of redemption following March 1, 2026, according to the indenture provisions, while a fundamental change in the company entitles them to demand a repurchase.

76,SMCI,Grok 3: Super Micro Computer (SMCI) Stock Price Outlook: Post-10-K Recovery Analysis,"Let’s analyze Super Micro Computer (SMCI) stock’s potential price trajectory based on its current financial situation, recent guidance, and future expectations, assuming the company files its delayed 10-K by February 25, 2025, resolves its accounting issues, and regains investor trust. The stock is currently around $48 (as of February 17, 2025), down from a pre-split peak of $120 ($1,200 pre-split) when revenue expectations were $15 billion for fiscal 2024. The plunge was driven by Hindenburg Research’s short report, EY’s resignation, and delays in audited financials. With the latest data and CEO Charles Liang’s $40 billion revenue projection for fiscal 2026, I’ll estimate stock prices under conservative, balanced, and optimistic scenarios at key dates: post-10-K (March 2025), end of fiscal 2025 (June 2025), and end of fiscal 2026 (June 2026).

**Current Financial Situation (Latest Available Data)**

SMCI hasn’t filed its fiscal 2024 10-K or fiscal 2025 Q1/Q2 10-Qs, but preliminary results and guidance provide a snapshot:

* Fiscal 2024 (ended June 30, 2024):
   * Revenue: $14.94 billion (reported in preliminary Q4 results, up 110% from $7.12 billion in fiscal 2023).
   * Net Income: \~$1.2 billion (extrapolated from prior quarters and Q4’s $402 million, though unaudited).
   * Gross Margin: 11.2% in Q4 (down from 17% in Q4 2023 due to supply chain costs and AI hardware scaling).
   * Shares Outstanding: \~586 million post-split (adjusted from \~58.6 million pre-split after the 10:1 split on January 27, 2025).
   * EPS (adjusted): $20.46 pre-split ($2.05 post-split) based on analyst consensus for fiscal 2024.
* Fiscal 2025 Q1 (ended September 30, 2024):
   * Preliminary Revenue: $5.9–$6 billion (up 181% YoY from $2.12 billion).
   * Preliminary Gross Margin: 13.3%.
   * Adjusted EPS: $0.75–$0.76 (post-split), exceeding prior guidance of $0.67–$0.83.
* Fiscal 2025 Q2 (ended December 31, 2024):
   * Preliminary Revenue: $5.6–$5.7 billion (up 54% YoY from $3.66 billion).
   * Adjusted EPS: $0.58–$0.60 (post-split), slightly below consensus of $0.61.
   * Guidance lowered from earlier $6–$7 billion due to supply constraints, but still reflects robust AI demand.
* Fiscal 2025 Guidance (full year):
   * Revenue: $23.5–$25 billion (down from $26–$30 billion, aligning with Wall Street’s $24.5 billion estimate).
   * EPS: Analyst consensus \~$2.17 (post-split), up 8% from $2.01 in fiscal 2024.
* Debt: $1.725 billion in 0% convertible notes due 2029, plus a new $700 million 2.25% convertible notes due 2028 (closing \~February 20, 2025). Debt-to-equity ratio is \~0.40, manageable given growth.
* Market Cap: At $48/share, \~$28 billion (586 million shares × $48).

**Future Expectations and Key Drivers**

* Fiscal 2026 Revenue Guidance: CEO Charles Liang projects “at least $40 billion” in fiscal 2026 (ending June 30, 2026), calling it “conservative.” Analysts previously estimated $29.18 billion, so this optimism hinges on:
   * AI Demand: SMCI’s leadership in AI servers, especially with NVIDIA’s Blackwell GPUs and direct-liquid cooling (DLC) tech, drives growth. Partnerships with NVIDIA, xAI (building the 100,000+ GPU Colossus supercomputer), and Fujitsu bolster this.
   * Capacity Expansion: New facilities in Malaysia and Taiwan, plus U.S. production, aim to meet demand.
   * Market Trends: Gartner predicts data center spending will rise 15.5% to $367 billion in 2025, favoring SMCI’s AI hardware niche.
* EPS Growth: Analysts project $2.38 for fiscal 2026 (up 9.7% from $2.17), but Liang’s $40 billion hint suggests potential for $3–$4/share if margins improve (currently squeezed at 13–15% vs. historical 17–18%).
* Risks Resolved: Filing the 10-K by February 25 avoids delisting, quells DOJ/SEC probe fears, and rebuilds trust post-Hindenburg and EY fallout. The Special Committee’s “no fraud” finding helps.

**Valuation Methodology**

SMCI traded at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of \~8 when it hit $120 post-split ($1,200 pre-split) with $15 billion revenue expected—a premium reflecting AI hype. Today, with $14.94 billion in fiscal 2024 revenue and a $28 billion market cap, P/S is \~1.9, well below the tech sector average of 7. I’ll use P/S multiples (conservative: 2, balanced: 4, optimistic: 6) based on revenue projections, cross-checked with P/E (20–30 range) against EPS estimates.

**Price Estimates**

1. March 2025 (Post-10-K Filing, Assuming Filed by February 25):
   * Revenue: Trailing 12 months \~$17 billion (Q3/Q4 2024 + Q1/Q2 2025).
   * EPS: \~$0.60 (Q2 prelim).
   * Conservative: P/S 2 × $17B = $34B market cap → $58/share. (Relief rally, tempered by past issues.)
   * Balanced: P/S 4 × $17B = $68B → $116/share. (Trust regained, AI growth priced in.)
   * Optimistic: P/S 6 × $17B = $102B → $174/share. (Short squeeze + keynote hype.)
2. June 2025 (End of Fiscal 2025):
   * Revenue: $24.5B (midpoint of $23.5–$25B guidance).
   * EPS: $2.17 (analyst consensus).
   * Conservative: P/S 2 × $24.5B = $49B → $84/share. (Steady growth, muted enthusiasm.)
   * Balanced: P/S 4 × $24.5B = $98B → $167/share. (Strong AI traction, P/E \~25 × $2.17 ≈ $54, but P/S drives higher.)
   * Optimistic: P/S 6 × $24.5B = $147B → $251/share. (Peak AI optimism, P/E 30 × $2.17 ≈ $65, P/S dominates.)
3. June 2026 (End of Fiscal 2026):
   * Revenue: $40B (CEO’s “conservative” guidance; optimistic case $45B).
   * EPS: $3.50 (assuming 8.75% net margin on $40B, 586M shares), vs. analyst $2.38.
   * Conservative: P/S 2 × $40B = $80B → $136/share. (Growth priced in cautiously, P/E 20 × $3.50 ≈ $70.)
   * Balanced: P/S 4 × $40B = $160B → $273/share. (P/E 25 × $3.50 ≈ $88, P/S reflects AI leadership.)
   * Optimistic: P/S 6 × $45B = $270B → $461/share. (P/E 30 × $4 ≈ $120, P/S assumes max growth + premium.)

**Prediction and Rationale**

* March 2025: $116 (balanced) seems likely if the 10-K lands cleanly. The recent climb from $40s to $48 reflects anticipation, and a successful filing could double the stock from today’s $48 as shorts cover and confidence returns. $174 (optimistic) is possible with a blowout keynote on February 20.
* June 2025: $167 (balanced) fits if SMCI delivers on $24.5 billion and margins stabilize. $251 (optimistic) requires flawless execution and NVIDIA-driven hype.
* June 2026: $273 (balanced) aligns with $40 billion revenue and a P/S of 4—reasonable given SMCI’s 70% growth in 2025 and 63% projected for 2026. $461 (optimistic) assumes $45 billion and a return to peak AI valuations (P/S 6), rivaling its $70 billion market cap at $120 last year.

**Why These Levels?**

SMCI’s plunge from $120 to $48 reflects a crisis of trust, not fundamentals—revenue doubled since then. At $40 billion in 2026, it’s 2.7× last year’s $15 billion when it hit $120, suggesting $273–$461 is plausible if sentiment rebounds. Partnerships (NVIDIA, xAI), DLC innovation, and $700 million in fresh capital bolster the case. Risks—margin pressure, competition from Dell/HP, or lingering legal overhang—cap the conservative case.",50,23,1739900841.0,2025-02-18T17:47:21+00:00,t3_1isinov,wallstreetbets,"Grok 3: Super Micro Computer (SMCI) Stock Price Outlook: Post-10-K Recovery Analysis Let’s analyze Super Micro Computer (SMCI) stock’s potential price trajectory based on its current financial situation, recent guidance, and future expectations, assuming the company files its delayed 10-K by February 25, 2025, resolves its accounting issues, and regains investor trust.

SMCI hasn’t filed its fiscal 2024 10-K or fiscal 2025 Q1/Q2 10-Qs, but preliminary results and guidance provide a snapshot:

* Fiscal 2024 (ended June 30, 2024):
   * Revenue: $14.94 billion (reported in preliminary Q4 results, up 110% from $7.12 billion in fiscal 2023).
   * Net Income: \~$1.2 billion (extrapolated from prior quarters and Q4’s $402 million, though unaudited).
   * Gross Margin: 11.2% in Q4 (down from 17% in Q4 2023 due to supply chain costs and AI hardware scaling).
   * Shares Outstanding: \~586 million post-split (adjusted from \~58.6 million pre-split after the 10:1 split on January 27, 2025).
   * EPS (adjusted): $20.46 pre-split ($2.05 post-split) based on analyst consensus for fiscal 2024.
* Fiscal 2025 Q1 (ended September 30, 2024):
   * Preliminary Revenue: $5.9–$6 billion (up 181% YoY from $2.12 billion).
   * Preliminary Gross Margin: 13.3%.
   * Adjusted EPS: $0.75–$0.76 (post-split), exceeding prior guidance of $0.67–$0.83.
* Fiscal 2025 Q2 (ended December 31, 2024):
   * Preliminary Revenue: $5.6–$5.7 billion (up 54% YoY from $3.66 billion).
   * Adjusted EPS: $0.58–$0.60 (post-split), slightly below consensus of $0.61.
   * Guidance lowered from earlier $6–$7 billion due to supply constraints, but still reflects robust AI demand.
* Fiscal 2025 Guidance (full year):
   * Revenue: $23.5–$25 billion (down from $26–$30 billion, aligning with Wall Street’s $24.5 billion estimate).
   * EPS: Analyst consensus \~$2.17 (post-split), up 8% from $2.01 in fiscal 2024.
* Debt: $1.725 billion in 0% convertible notes due 2029, plus a new $700 million 2.25% convertible notes due 2028 (closing \~February 20, 2025). Debt-to-equity ratio is \~0.40, manageable given growth.
* Market Cap: At $48/share, \~$28 billion (586 million shares × $48).

**Future Expectations and Key Drivers**

* Fiscal 2026 Revenue Guidance: CEO Charles Liang projects “at least $40 billion” in fiscal 2026 (ending June 30, 2026), calling it “conservative.” Analysts previously estimated $29.18 billion, so this optimism hinges on:
   * AI Demand: SMCI’s leadership in AI servers, especially with NVIDIA’s Blackwell GPUs and direct-liquid cooling (DLC) tech, drives growth. Partnerships with NVIDIA, xAI (building the 100,000+ GPU Colossus supercomputer), and Fujitsu bolster this.
   * Capacity Expansion: New facilities in Malaysia and Taiwan, plus U.S. production, aim to meet demand.
   * Market Trends: Gartner predicts data center spending will rise 15.5% to $367 billion in 2025, favoring SMCI’s AI hardware niche.
* EPS Growth: Analysts project $2.38 for fiscal 2026 (up 9.7% from $2.17), but Liang’s $40 billion hint suggests potential for $3–$4/share if margins improve (currently squeezed at 13–15% vs. historical 17–18%).
* Risks Resolved: Filing the 10-K by February 25 avoids delisting, quells DOJ/SEC probe fears, and rebuilds trust post-Hindenburg and EY fallout. The Special Committee’s “no fraud” finding helps.

**Valuation Methodology**

SMCI traded at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of \~8 when it hit $120 post-split ($1,200 pre-split) with $15 billion revenue expected—a premium reflecting AI hype. Today, with $14.94 billion in fiscal 2024 revenue and a $28 billion market cap, P/S is \~1.9, well below the tech sector average of 7. I’ll use P/S multiples (conservative: 2, balanced: 4, optimistic: 6) based on revenue projections, cross-checked with P/E (20–30 range) against EPS estimates.

**Price Estimates**

1. March 2025 (Post-10-K Filing, Assuming Filed by February 25):
   * Revenue: Trailing 12 months \~$17 billion (Q3/Q4 2024 + Q1/Q2 2025).
   * EPS: \~$0.60 (Q2 prelim).
   * Conservative: P/S 2 × $17B = $34B market cap → $58/share. (Relief rally, tempered by past issues.)
   * Balanced: P/S 4 × $17B = $68B → $116/share. (Trust regained, AI growth priced in.)
   * Optimistic: P/S 6 × $17B = $102B → $174/share. (Short squeeze + keynote hype.)
2. June 2025 (End of Fiscal 2025):
   * Revenue: $24.5B (midpoint of $23.5–$25B guidance).
   * EPS: $2.17 (analyst consensus).
   * Conservative: P/S 2 × $24.5B = $49B → $84/share. (Steady growth, muted enthusiasm.)
   * Balanced: P/S 4 × $24.5B = $98B → $167/share. (Strong AI traction, P/E \~25 × $2.17 ≈ $54, but P/S drives higher.)
   * Optimistic: P/S 6 × $24.5B = $147B → $251/share. (Peak AI optimism, P/E 30 × $2.17 ≈ $65, P/S dominates.)
3. June 2026 (End of Fiscal 2026):
   * Revenue: $40B (CEO’s “conservative” guidance; optimistic case $45B).
   * EPS: $3.50 (assuming 8.75% net margin on $40B, 586M shares), vs. analyst $2.38.
   * Conservative: P/S 2 × $40B = $80B → $136/share. (Growth priced in cautiously, P/E 20 × $3.50 ≈ $70.)
   * Balanced: P/S 4 × $40B = $160B → $273/share. (P/E 25 × $3.50 ≈ $88, P/S reflects AI leadership.)
   * Optimistic: P/S 6 × $45B = $270B → $461/share. (P/E 30 × $4 ≈ $120, P/S assumes max growth + premium.)

**Prediction and Rationale**

* March 2025: $116 (balanced) seems likely if the 10-K lands cleanly. The recent climb from $40s to $48 reflects anticipation, and a successful filing could double the stock from today’s $48 as shorts cover and confidence returns. $174 (optimistic) is possible with a blowout keynote on February 20.
* June 2025: $167 (balanced) fits if SMCI delivers on $24.5 billion and margins stabilize. $251 (optimistic) requires flawless execution and NVIDIA-driven hype.
* June 2026: $273 (balanced) aligns with $40 billion revenue and a P/S of 4—reasonable given SMCI’s 70% growth in 2025 and 63% projected for 2026. $461 (optimistic) assumes $45 billion and a return to peak AI valuations (P/S 6), rivaling its $70 billion market cap at $120 last year.

**Why These Levels?**

SMCI’s plunge from $120 to $48 reflects a crisis of trust, not fundamentals—revenue doubled since then. At $40 billion in 2026, it’s 2.7× last year’s $15 billion when it hit $120, suggesting $273–$461 is plausible if sentiment rebounds. Partnerships (NVIDIA, xAI), DLC innovation, and $700 million in fresh capital bolster the case. Risks—margin pressure, competition from Dell/HP, or lingering legal overhang—cap the conservative case.",0.012460064142942429,0.9652085304260254,0.022331392392516136,negative,0.9652085304260254,-0.952748466283083

30,SMCI,Structuring A Spread in a Cash Secured Environment With a BPE That Is &lt;50% Of Naked,"We all get it ... .  Working in a cash secured environment can kind of suck for ROC %-age metrics if you're going to be sticking with out-of-the-money naked short puts.

For example, the SPY 45 DTE 25 delta short put strike in April 4th expiry is paying 4.95 for the 590 on a buying power effect (BPE), a crappy .84% ROC as a function of strike price.  6.39% annualized.  That doesn't exactly ""rock the house.""

However, you can structure a spread to basically double (yes, double) the ROC %-age at max over selling a naked put, and it involves looking at buying a strike that is 50% of the short option strike, which for the 590 would be at the 295 or a higher strike where the short put still goes for ""cheap.""  In the April 4th, the lowest strike available would be the 375, costing .19 to put on.  The brings in the BPE to ... wait for it ... 210.24, more than a 50% reduction in BPE over the naked 590, with the resulting ROC %-age at max being 2.26%; 17.19% annualized.  That isn't horrible, particularly in contrast to what the naked is paying.

Now, before you get all excited here and think doing things this way is the greatest thing since sliced bread, you need to keep in mind the following ... .

The notional risk is basically the same as that of a naked short put.  In other words, you need to keep in mind that BP needs to be potentially available to take on shares at the short put option strike.  In practice, however, assignment should be rare if you sell the right duration at the right delta and in the right IV environment, coupled with taking profit at 50% max and using mechanical trade management techniques. 

Because the long put is so far OTM, it frequently goes no bid and can't be closed or rolled along with the short put as a unit.  Consequently, if you need to roll out the short put as an assignment avoidance technique but can't roll out the long put with it because there aren't any bidders for it, you may have to (a) determine what strike you're going to roll your short put to; (b) buy a cheap put that is &gt;50% the strike price of the strike you're rolling to; and ***then*** (c) roll out the short put.  

Other Examples In Stuff That Doesn't Have the Crappy IV of SPY:

NOTE: Regarding the options section and the $7k loss this week. AFRM was up another 12.89% after a 21.88% surge last Friday. I own 400 shares and have 4 outstanding covers calls all with a strike of $52.5. Since AFRM is up to $80.66 today, the total return on those options is -$9,517 (-119.76%). This is because of the fact that as the underlying increases the amount to buy back the outstanding covered call with the $52.5 strike goes up as well. This means that the covered call has a growing unrealized gain as the share price appreciates. New options for 2028 come out in September. If the shares have not been assigned by then, I will look into rolling to the highest strike possible. 

I added this note to illustrate that a covered call that has its strike surpassed by share price will negatively affect this options display. Unless the option gets assigned or rolled, it will stay an unrealized loss.

I’m currently utilizing $36,800 in cash secured put collateral, up from $35,050 last week.

I sell options on a weekly basis. I prefer cash secured puts and covered calls. Sometimes I’m ahead of the indexes and sometimes I’m behind. My goal is consistency in option premium revenue.

The portfolio is comprised of 94 unique tickers up from 93 last week. These 94 tickers have a value of $356k. I also have 152 open option positions, down from 154 last week. The options have a total value of -$3k. The total of the shares and options is $353k. 

I’m currently utilizing $36,800 in cash secured put collateral, up from $35,050 last week.

I sell options on a weekly basis. I prefer cash secured puts and covered calls. Sometimes I’m ahead of the indexes and sometimes I’m behind. My goal is consistency in option premium revenue.

Commissions:
I use Robinhood as a broker and they do not charge commissions. There is a an industry standard regulation fee of $0.03 per contract. Last year I sold just over 1,400 contracts which is just over $40.00 in fees paid in 2024. In 2025, the contract fee is $0.04, which would push the fees up to around $60 based on current projections.  

The premiums have increased significantly as my experience has expanded over the last three years. 

Hope you all have a lucrative 2025. Make sure to post your wins. I look forward to reading about them!",0.19740837812423706,0.24859653413295746,0.5539950728416443,neutral,0.5539950728416443,-0.0511881560087204

This has been the most time I've ever spent researching a stock. So far, in matters of relevance, key indicators have been used based on relevant facts over BS fiction short seller reports. Let's look at historical facts and readily available information. SMCI company is BRUTALLY HONEST, and they are being reported as misleading. I will have every short summaries of all relevant information of last delisting, and recent late filing to instill confidence of actually reporting this time.  Adding more calls at open. For Mar 21. paper handed a ton already. over 5 k in profits. Been following since $18.already but the more I dig the more confidence I get. Will allocate more of those funds in intervals before Feb 20 as I believe that day will have huge news. Will probably not add any very long dates calls because I believe market cap will increase 100% by Mar21. Probably 300-500% by 27. But those profits for Mar21-April range are going to absolutely generate 1000s% anyways. 
 
This post indicates all relevant information and overlooks no available Info im confident. if I did post a comment as I’ve got over 100 hours jn on this stock now. 

Keep in mind CEOs for SMCI and Nvidia are meeting DDN Feb 20 to discuss what DDN says as possibly ground breaking AI news. Black Stone just invested 300m into this Private equity company. I think we can use some of the words SMCI said in the last business update to make this information relevant like “Confidential new product line” he touched on this Feb 12. Let’s keep in mind SMCI offered 700M convertible notes. Not sure what’s about to roll out but I think SMCI was pummeled with legal fees and this news needs money like now. I’m almost certain we have filing before the Feb 25th. I say this 1) DDN Feb 20 2)Before 20th or after but before 25th release all filings1, 10ks, 3, 10Qs. 3) New CFO before 25. 4) NVIDIA discussing huge earnings with new news on huge upcoming projects. Maybe talking and pumping SMCI with proud partner getting ready for this huge BOOM. 
 Couple this with Trump, EU already talking HUNDREDS of billions will be dumped into AI over next 5 years. Couple this with trump possibly doing big tax cuts, like we’ve seen in the past. And honestly couple this with the true news that this company is literally pulling in 10s of billions as they were in 2023 and are at half the market cap on all this BS news. I think SMCI priced in for SMCI not listing documents and going under selling OTC I’m being serious. 25b rev this year market cap 24b. This is going to change very soon. 

Information below this will give you more confidence that SMCI will 100% file based on being honest in the past. And some other miscellaneous things. 

1) September 14, 2017. The initial delay in 10-k. \*EXACT WORDS\* ""The Company is unable at this time to provide a date as to when the review and the audits will be completed."" this is over internal controls over financial reporting for June 30, 2017, 10-k... ""Company operating expense expected to be higher for the quarter because of legal and accounting costs.""

2) January 30, 2018. Fin info/Management changes/delayed sec filings update... ""Audit Committee completed disclosed investigation. We will need additional reviews before the finalized 10k report to determine if changes will need to be made. KEY UNABLE THIS TIME TO PROVIDE DATE FOR 10-K.""  Today's new CFO is Kevin Bauer. Needs plan update on FEB 28 for filings due March 13 ""SEC Compliance.""

3) FEB 20, 2018. The exact words 8 days before the deadline... I need more time for 10k and will request an extension on an update for FEB 28. If not granted, they said they had the option to appeal. (Was Granted) extended 180 days  

4) May 3, 2018, Fin/Info Because I'm transparent, I include all ""KEY POINT relevant updates to show endpoint differences in tones."" Back to update, ""Audit committee overseeing additional testing company believes it is nearing completion for \*current filings only\*. \*NOT INCLUDING 10K BACK TO BEARISH\*."" Then it directly goes back to saying additional testing is required to analyze the impact on the company's historical financial statements and complete 10k... Back to square 1. They say they will file 10Q for sep30,dec31, and March 31 after the 10k release, but there is no update, and they say additional time is needed for 10k. He still needs 10- K by August 24.

5) July30/Aug 7 4Q fin. Results were scheduled for August 7 after the announcement on July 30 and rescheduled to August 21, on August 7. It's horrible News, as the update was critical at this point because delisting would occur if reports were not filed on August 24... This is where I believe all the people claiming SMCI are crooks. \*But keep in mind at no point did they warrant 10-K was anywhere near ready but consistently diligent with saying current reports are looking good ""10Qs"", but 10 K still needs extensive care and has to be released first, then goes on and says 10K still needs to go through extensive testing for historical info throughout 2017-2018 going all the way to final update\* Yes this information for investors would warrant an even further upset failing to produce positive News for compliance. But again, at NO POINT DID SMCI EVER POST NEWS OF 10 K progress nearing completion up until or by AUG24.

6) August 21 4Q Fin/Info is irrelevant; it is a separate article. SEC FILINGS... It says, as we all know, extreme leaps were made, but they came up short due to the pure magnitude of historical information that needs to be audited. Remember that the AI wave is pumping in tons of new business, and companies need extensive capital for pure growth to come. And also being blasted by legal fees and accounting costs crippling this company's margins and ability to keep up with demand. But at NO POINT EVER INSIGHTED SIGNIFICANT VALUE IN THE PROOF OF RELEASE OF 10K.

Part 2. (1B) 2024/5 current news. (1B1) News compares/contrasts the 2018 delist to the 25 News and relists 2020. (1C) Deception of short sellers HIDENBUGER (closed)actual truths and findings of (EY).

1B) August 28 Delays 10K internal controls over Fin. Reporting.

2B) November 5: A special committee releases information/SEC filing update \* investigation is complete on concerns raised by EY. No fraud or misconduct was found.\* \*But for remedial measures, strengthen internal governance and oversight functions\* says unable to give a time frame on 10k filings\* No auditor is the reason for that

3B) November 18 new auditor BDO. Ask for a time extension. \*November 20 says they will have all updated audited 10ks and 10qs within the discretionary period\* if it is granted time. This, along with the request for late filings of current quarters, is 10 qs.

4(B) DDecember 2review independent committee. It talks about recommendations for a new CFO, executives, and strengthening measures with more experience. As well what was supposed to be assessed raised by EY. concerns ""(i) the integrity of the Company's senior management and Audit Committee, (ii) the commitment of the Company's senior management and Audit Committee to ensuring that the Company's financial statements are materially accurate, (iii) the Audit Committee's independence and ability to provide proper oversight over matters relating to financial reporting, and (iv) the tone at the top of the Company about rehiring certain former employees and financial reporting"" All concerns raised by EY appeared to hold no weight, and SMCI was compliant with independent committee everything came back good... Very import read SMCI IR December 2 2024 recommend reading full document. Also, SMCI says they believe they will have all filings within the discretionary period. February 25

5B) February 11, 2024 Fin. Update business call. They said they believe they will file all past and current, up-to-date quarterly and yearly forms. By February 25. They can't say anything more than this, but it's a dead giveaway compared to the reports in the past. Also, I subpoenaed the court for a short seller report from Aug(Hidenburg) And all the suits caused by this. SMCI says these are without merit and that no past statements need restatements. 

(1B1) January 9 2020 approved relist 14th first trade day.

(2B1) AUG 25, 2020 accounting investigation settlement. They never actually admitted to anything of fraud but indeed paid the settlement. Whether they cooked the books or not, they likely did. Do I find this necessarily bearish? For the time being, yes (2020). 

(3B1) Compared, some factors had near resemblances. Based on reports raised by Hidenburg, EY.

(4B1) In Contrast, there was a reasonable likelihood that 2024 issues were raised for external Speculation. In 2017/18, there was a valid reason to believe that SMCI was cooking books.

1C) Hindenburg reports, I'll be 1000% honest: this is the laziest report I've ever seen written. I'll go straight down the list. The statement is fear-mongering availability bias practice; Hurryand reminds them of 2018. Anyways,. It says SMCI was listed in 2018. Get this. I quote, ""By August 2020, found improperly reporting revenue and fined."" It would've taken half a second to realize this was, for instance, for 2018 delisting. I will tell you that Smci execs after relisting. I will say this with this statement about hiring three execs back 3 months after reinstatement to scare people that they're doing the same thing. No evidence for years after has ever been brought up about the. SEC heavily looked into SMCI after initially relisting. This is absolute madness. Well, I don't need to tell you this is false because there are about five statements down. The new CFO, extremely honest, goes even further in-depth several pages down. Later in the article,. It goes on and on about how great Kevin Bauer would never steal. Then, he says that SMCI cut his head in 2021 so they could get going. He talks about how the SEC liked him and how SMCI feared him being too fair and honest. But as mentioned, they were already improperly recording revenue 3 months after reinstatement. Then he seems to go on about them doing business with his brothers, about an industry I know well. It looks like this brother's company does sub-assembly, a massive manufacturing tool. I'm sure it's way cheaper labor overseas. Then, it acts as if SMCI is wrong for not disclosing them when they didn't have to until the filing. EY was also going through losing 84 companies because they were labeled the company with the most mistakes made by mad numbers. It costs 200 million dollars with all of these losses for EY. This was a perfect chance for EY to take the steam off their prior failures. Anyways, all the information claimed on SMCI has now been claimed as false. Not only this, but EY did all the 10-Q for 2023. Why did they wait until mid-Octoberr after Hindenburg reported a year after they did the auditing on every 10-Q prior to report all of SMCI fraud?

News: [Google Ceo Sees Useful Quantum Computers 5 To 10 Years Away](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-12/google-ceo-sees-useful-quantum-computers-5-to-10-years-away)

**Ticker:** [**SPY**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SPY&amp;p=d)**,** [**QQQ**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=QQQ&amp;p=d)**,** [**VXX**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VXX&amp;p=d)**, UPRO and other market ETFs**

**Technicals:** Already positioned with my short on PLTR and have some shares of UPRO short, but interested if we'll see another new low in the markets (breaking the low of post-CPI report established).

**Catalyst:** CPI report of inflation gauges come in far higher than estimates, fed cuts seen less likely in first half of 2025, which resulted in a selloff for the entire market premarket. Inflation's back on the menu boys.

**Risks:** We'll likely see more volatility at the open obviously, and see more selloffs in the speculative/hype sectors, but I'm mainly focused on broader market movements and PLTR short I mentioned yesterday.

**Ticker:** [**SMCI (Super Micro Computer, Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SMCI&amp;p=d)

https://preview.redd.it/braz34ybupie1.png?width=1535&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d98fd34b133f9077108087635e3fabc8b76c9ba

**Catalyst:** Super Micro Computer missed expectations and reduced its sales outlook for FY 2025, now projecting revenue between $23.5-$25B, down from the previous estimate of $26B- $30B.

The company also announced plans to submit delayed filings to the SEC by February 25 to avoid delisting.

**Technicals:** Ultimately a miss on earnings, but the news of submitting filings to the SEC was what made the stock recover afterhours yesterday. Not too interested in this until we get a news update on the filings that will determine if this is not as shady as Hindenburg makes it out to seem.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The semis sector is somewhat stressed due to the possible tariffs on semis coming in that Trump threatened. SMCI revising downward is clearly bad, while they expect growth in 2026 due to future growth from AI infrastructure demand.

Obviously if they fail to submit a delayed filing then that would be a brutal blow for the stock.

**Risks:** Most of them are detailed in Hindenburg's report (Link here: [Hindenburg Report](https://hindenburgresearch.com/smci/))

**Catalyst:** Zillow and RDFN announced a partnership making Zillow (ZG) the exclusive provider of multifamily rental listings (properties with 25+ units) on RDN and its sites.

**Technicals:** None to speak of, but partnering means their revenue is tied a little closer together, meaning they will trade together/greater correlation.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The real estate sector is increasingly focusing on user experiences through partnerships, rather than trying to expand outward- this allows them to charge a premium vs value.

This collaboration aims to provide renters with a more comprehensive search platform while expanding the reach for property marketers (ultimately advertising).

**Risks:** Probably regulatory issues, but likely won't be facing those in this admin.

**Catalyst:** SWTX received FDA approval for GOMEKLI (mirdametinib) for the treatment of patients with neurofibromatosis type 1-associated plexiform neurofibromas (NF1-PN). TAM is roughly $1B yearly.

**Technicals:** $55 is the level. 

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Having ""the"" drug for treatment pretty much turns a nothing biotech stock into a somebody (which later leads to them getting acquired by a giant like MRK).

**Risks:** MRK calls deal off, which is the reason for the massive moves in the past 2 days and we see a reversal of that news.

News: [EU Says It Will Impose Countermeasures Against US Tariffs](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-11/eu-says-it-will-impose-countermeasures-against-us-tariffs)

**Ticker:** [**PSX (Phillips 66)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PSX&amp;p=d)

**Catalyst:** Elliott Management has increased its stake in Phillips 66 to over $2.5 billion, advocating for operational changes to enhance shareholder value. Elliott is believed to push the company to spin off or sell midstream opportunities.

**Technicals:** We made a 6% move (just like when Elliott took a stake in BP), we may see another leg of movement during the day.

**Risks:** Spinning off a segment reduces income diversification (at the possible benefit of having a higher valuation multiple), more of a long-term investment risk than a short term one. In the short-term, expect a ton of marginal headlines that will move the stock up/down 1% depending on how they want to make changes.

**Related Tickers:** BP, XOM, CVX, MPC

**Ticker:** [**LSCC (Lattice Semiconductor)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=LSCC&amp;p=d)

**Catalyst:** LSCC reported EPS of $0.15 vs. $0.19 expected. Revenue of $117.4 million vs. $117 million expected. Provided strong indication of improving customer consumption and stronger future demand.

**Technicals:** Watching $65 level to the upside. Overall not interested in shorting this if I had to take a position.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The semiconductor industry is signaling increased demand and increased spending across all companies, which is bullish obviously. Despite slightly missing EPS they signaled a good enough outlook that the stock reacted positively to Earnings. LSCC makes low power FPGAs.

**Related Tickers:** NVDA, AMD, INTC, TXN

**Ticker:** [**ASTS (AST SpaceMobile)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASTS&amp;p=d)

**Catalyst:** Following TMUS's announcement of compatibility with Starlink Beta, ASTS (a close competitor) experienced an 18% increase, with potential for further movement (both upside/downside) today, particularly around the $30 level.

**Technicals:** I'm leaning more towards pullback today, watching $30 level.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The satellite communications industry is rapidly evolving, with major players forming partnerships to expand global connectivity. Starlink is the biggest company out there, but ASTS moves whenever adoption news comes out, like it did previously with Verizon.

**Risks:** Competition from entities like Starlink may pressure ASTS's market share and profitability in the future, especially when SpaceX is expected to IPO (eventually). Remember that ASTS has 5 satellites and is working on \~19 more.

**Offhand Comments:** The market's reaction underscores the ""adoption trade"", kind of like how all the weed stocks moved with each other.

**Ticker:** [**PLTR (Palantir Technologies)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PLTR&amp;p=d)

**Catalyst:** Nothing significant today, but we saw a huge spike up to $117.75 yesterday, likely from comments made during the Paris AI summit. Currently short.

**Technicals:** Interested in $115 level as an add, on the short side. Watching $120 as the level to cover on.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** PLTR has made the mother of all moves recently, gaining 50% in the past 2 weeks. Most of that was from earnings,

**Risks:** For a trade, I'm capping my risk at $120- everyone and their mother knows that PLTR is overvalued and run on hype at this point, and a move up to $100 from earnings might be tolerable but adding an extra 15% on top of that is irrational (in my opinion). Obviously there's significant retail interest in this stock, so will have to be agile and cognizant of what they're thinking as stock moves around.

92,SMCI,"SMCI - Road to Redemption, or The Final Blow?","# SMCI - Road to Redemption, or The Final Blow?

Gamblers, regards, and fellow degens, lend me your ears. We are approaching what could be one of the largest opportunities of the year: aping into an equity that has been continually embroiled in SEC investigations.

I, of course, am speaking of Supermicro (SMCI).

Now, many of you may be familiar with super micros, but this one is a bit different. If you are not familiar, Supermicro (henceforth SMCI) became the poster child for GPU server buildouts, mainly leveraging their liquid cooling capabilities which made them highly appealing to hyperscalers. There are entire realms of study dedicated to the science cooling server farms, and those circles have supported liquid cooling for quite a while, and they are a total darling of Nvidia. It traded to a high of $124 during AI exuberance as a pick-and-shovel play, only to have an Icarian fall back to low double digits, trading to $17 at its lowest.

This fall was due to the now-defunct Hindenburg short selling group, who in 2024 released a report that SMCI was engaging in less than savory, and manipulative at worse, accounting practices that essentially reported revenue that had not been received. Additionally, the report alleges that the company was evading export restrictions on GPUs by shipping to Russia. Unverified, but it is known that Chinese companies DID get their hands on restricted GPUs through SMCI products. The next day, SMCI delayed the filling of its 10-k, crushing the stock price. The DoJ then probed the company. SMCI hired Ernst &amp; Young to audit the company which saw the auditors quit as they experienced what they referred to as an unwillingness on the part of executives to aid them. The equity price was entirely demolished by this point.

A somewhat bump in the stock price was due to regulatory bodies allowing them until Feb 25th, 2025 to publish their delinquent earnings.

Now for the recent updates.

Earlier this week, the company stated that they would release a business update next Tuesday, February 11th before the filing deadline on February 25th. This has rocketed the stock logarithmically as people anticipate un-audited earnings and confirmation that they will be able to file by the deadline. Additionally, they stated that they have cooling racks with built-in Blackwell chips ready to go. If this is all true, and earnings are good, this stock price will skyrocket. We will see $50 by the end of the week, if not higher. This, of course, is delectable to struggling 'gards. I personally am eyeing Feb 28th 37 C @ 2.90.

However, there are some major issues beyond those outlined within the saga.

1. There is a major chance that they announce they will take this private. While they were able to secure BDO post E&amp;Y failure, there has been little visibility on the progress of the audit and filing progress.
2. There is a high chance that the company will restate past financials. This may not be a problem if forward guidance is good, but if there is no margin for error.
3. Nvidia tried to distance itself from SMCI by vendoring to Gigabyte and ASRock. This could have greatly decreased potential revenue for SMCI
4. In December, they considered a private investment in public equity by engaging Evercore, which would help them raise the capital. This casts doubts on the integrity of the financials and health of sales.
5. There has been an absurd amount of dark pool buying, and a good amount of insider buying. What strikes me as strange, however, is that the insider buying is done by Cheung, the man who oversaw the ""botched"" financials.

To conclude, I'm at a sort of impasse here. This is obviously a highly risky play, but I could not forgive myself if I did not put my balls on the table and it takes off. Part of this is me just talking to myself, but maybe you all will find some utility in reading this, or share your thoughts (or lack thereof).",47,43,1738853198.0,2025-02-06T14:46:38+00:00,t3_1ij4667,wallstreetbets,"SMCI - Road to Redemption, or The Final Blow? # SMCI - Road to Redemption, or The Final Blow?

It rallied 60% to $15.39 in a week. On 11/15/24, I bought SMCI believing extension approval likely. It rallied 138% to $44.16. With earnings tomorrow, Bitcoin miner CLSK is up next.

Don't be surprised if CLSK beats earnings, stays on track for 50 exahash by H1 2025, and further builds shareholder value with higher projected BTC per share. While RIOT and MARA copy MSTR using convertible notes buying Bitcoin at \~$100k, CLSK invested in itself using their $650M note to instead buy back shares and fund growth. 2 days ago, CLSK announced surpassing 40 exahash. Despite 28% shorts and negative EPS projections, CLSK may make some serious noise on wall street as shorts learn the hard way not to be greedy. If you're bullish on Bitcoin, CLSK assets and profits are going HIGHER this year too. If it matters, last year CLSK rallied HARD after beating earnings early February 2024 too.

If one invests like everyone else, one will get the same gains as everyone else. I am beyond excited to see what's coming for CLSK shareholders and Bitcoin holders in the years to come. I'm ready CLSK.

27,SMCI,Recommendation of Companies Like PLTR,"I've been looking for a solid long-term investment, especially after missing out on PLTR. I spent two years trying to trade penny stocks but failed badly. A year ago, I bought SMCI and ended up losing 80%, despite doing extensive due diligence.

30,SMCI,SMCI Earnings 2/11/25 and History,"NEWS: HPC-AI server stock SMCI announces business update for 2/11/25. After last earnings call, I can see NVDA B200 GPU's releasing Q1 2025 and liquid servers leading to high 2025 projections for SMCI. Updates on 10-K filings being on track would also build confidence. Details below:

Compared to its 52 week high of $122.90, SMCI is still trading at a 76% discount of $29.50. So how did it get so low and what's in store for SMCI from here on out?

1. On 8/28/24, Hindenberg released its short report right after NVDA went down 7% after earnings due to FUD concerning their massive growth was unsustainable (which turned out to be plain wrong). Before this, SMCI and NVDA mirrored each other's price changes.
2. Following this in September 2024, the DOJ released a report that led to a 10% drop that was quickly bought back up to original stock price in 2 weeks.
3. The drop that actually mattered was the one in October 2024 confirming accountant E&amp;Y backed out. This has been priced in and is the big question mark. BDO is the new accounting firm and 10-K is due 2/25.
4. In my opinion, SMCI may have fudged numbers a bit like making deliveries early to meet earnings goals. This is COMPLETELY DIFFERENT from pretending there are no orders to begin with.
5. After getting an extension by nasdaq to file their 10-K which led to a rally up to $50 early December, the market wide EOY sell off following HPC-AI FUD from DeepSeek led to the price decline we see today.
6. On 1/29/25, SMCI chief accounting officer Kenneth Cheung accepted stock options which may indicate confidence in timely submission of 10-K forms.

As you may summize, SMCI price is low mainly due to FUD concerning the integrity of its numbers. It has huge partnerships with NVDA, GOOGL, AMZN and xai and its server business has high demand. Earnings goal for SMCI will be to restore its reputation.

52,SMCI,Is SMCI SMUGGLING NVIDIA GPUS to CHINA?!?!?,"Gather 'round, I've stumbled upon some juicy DD that's bad news for any $SMCI bulls.

Yesterday, a video surfaced on X, of a Chinese entrepreneur bragging about getting 200 NVIDIA H200 GPUs despite the export ban, claiming that he's done so for the past 5 year.

But where the story gets really interesting is when the video shows him pulling the NVIDA H200s out from a fresh delivery, which clearly shows $SMCI logo on the boxes he received...

Now before any $SMCI bulls go panic-denial mode, let's put this into context:

* \*\*2018:\*\*$SMCI gets yeeted off Nasdaq for ""losing"" its financial statements. 
* **2020: SEC Slapdown:** $17.5 million fine for widespread accounting violations. The bill is paid, and 3 months later $SMCI rehires the same execs directly involved in the fraud numbers
* **2024:**
   * Hindenburg drops a DD bomb, accusing them of *still* mishandling their numbers, even accusing SMCI of ""violations in US export bans""... interesting
   *  Ernst &amp; Young resign as SMCI's auditor after raising concerns about the company's accounting practices, board management... maybe they picked up on rumors of an additional revenue stream that was hidden in the books as well, who knows.
* **Lawsuits, Lawsuits Everywhere:** Ex-employees whisteblowers continue reporting falsified revenue numbers and other sus accounting practices. 10-k gets ""misplaced"", nice one

And now this video. Definitely not the PR $SMCI needs right now.

Could this be a coincidence? Unlikely. But sure, let's assume $SMCI is just an innocent pawn in this Chinese GPU smuggling game without ever realizing, the accusation alone could trigger a huge sell off. DeepSeek's roll out sent a wake up to the US: we've lost the lead in our own game.

9,SMCI,"Nvidia sheds almost $600 billion in market cap, biggest one-day loss in U.S. history","Nvidia lost close to $600 billion in market cap on Monday, the biggest drop for any company on a single day in U.S. history.

The chipmaker’s stock price plummeted 17% to close at $118.58. It was Nvidia’s worst day on the market since March 16, 2020, which was early in the Covid pandemic. After surpassing Apple last week to become the most valuable publicly traded company, Nvidia’s drop on Monday led a 3.1% slide in the tech-heavy Nasdaq.

The selloff was sparked by concerns that Chinese artificial intelligence lab DeepSeek is presenting increased competition in the global AI battle. Late last month, DeepSeek unveiled a free, open-source large language model that it says took only two months and less than $6 million to build, using reduced-capability chips from Nvidia, called H800s. 

Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) dominate the market for AI data center chips in the U.S., with tech giants like Alphabet, Meta, and Amazon spending billions of dollars on the processors to train and run their AI models. Analysts at Cantor wrote in a report on Monday that the release of DeepSeek’s latest technology has caused “great angst as to the impact for compute demand, and therefore, fears of peak spending on GPUs.”

The analysts, who recommend buying Nvidia shares, said they “think this view is farthest from the truth,” and that advancements in AI will most likely lead to “the AI industry wanting more compute, not less.”

But after Nvidia’s huge run-up — the stock soared 239% in 2023 and 171% last year — the market is on edge about any possible pullback in spending. Broadcom, the other big U.S. chipmaker to see giant valuation gains from AI, fell 17% on Monday, pulling its market cap down by $200 billion.

Data center companies reliant on Nvidia’s GPUs for their hardware sales saw big selloffs as well. Dell, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Super Micro Computer dropped at least 5.8%. Oracle, a part of President Donald Trump’s latest AI initiative, fell 14%.

For Nvidia, the loss was more than double the $279 billion drop the company saw in September, which was the biggest one-day market value loss in history at the time, unseating Meta’s $232 billion loss in 2022. Before that, the steepest drop was $182 billion by Apple in 2020.

Nvidia’s decline is more than double the market cap of Coca-Cola and Chevron and exceeds the market value of both Oracle and Netflix.

CEO Jensen Huang’s net worth also took a massive hit, declining roughly $21 billion, according to Forbes’ real-time billionaires list. The move demoted Huang to 17th on the richest-person list.

The sudden excitement around DeepSeek over the weekend pushed its app past OpenAI’s ChatGPT as the most-downloaded free app in the U.S. on Apple’s App Store. The model’s development comes despite a slew of recent curbs on U.S. chip exports to China.

Venture capitalist David Sacks, who was tapped by Trump to be the White House’s AI and crypto czar, wrote on X that DeepSeek’s model “shows that the AI race will be very competitive” and that Trump was right to rescind President Joe Biden’s executive order last week on AI safety.

“I’m confident in the U.S. but we can’t be complacent,” Sacks wrote.

Nvidia is now the third most-valuable public company, behind Apple and Microsoft.

19,SMCI,What do you think about Leverage Shares 2x Long Super Micro Computer?,"Hey everyone,



I’ve been looking into the Leverage Shares 2x Long Super Micro Computer ETF and noticed an interesting trend. When the price of SMCI shares was around $17.50 and went up to $49.50, the 2x leveraged ETF increased roughly six times over the same period, outperforming the expected 2x leverage.



With SMCI expected to sort out their financials soon, I’m considering whether it might be a better idea to buy the 2x leveraged ETF instead of the regular shares for the next few months. This would align with my expectation that the shares will rise significantly in the next 2-3 months.



Has anyone here had experience with leveraged ETFs like this one, particularly for stocks with strong growth potential? Any pros/cons to consider before jumping in with the leveraged ETF?

74,SMCI,To conclude my investing year of 2024 (Take-profit Part),"3.5x – Tesla: From April’s low of $140 to the current $500.

5x – NVIDIA: From $200-$300 at the start of the year to a peak of $1,500.

10x – SMCI: Stock started around $100 when the company began deploying its equipment and hit a high of $1,200.

4x – Palantir ($PLTR): Hesitated when it was $20 earlier this year; jaw dropped at $80.

12x – Rigetti Computing ($RGTI): A friend recommended it at $1.3, now close to $12 (I didn’t buy! 😭).

1.8x – Broadcom ($AVGO): Got in at the low of $1,300; it’s now at $2,400. 💃

9x – SoundHound AI: From $2-$4 initially, then $8, and now $19.

4x – Reddit ($RDDT): IPO at $45, now at $180.

3x – $BGM: AI + pharma play. A friend tipped me off at $3.8, peaked at $11.6 (I invested! 🙏).

4.5x – $RKLB: A colleague recommended it at $6; I sold at $27. 😘

These are roughly the investment gains I’ve tracked this year. Of course, there were losses too, which I won’t detail.

For example:

$AIFU (AI + Insurance): Recommended by a friend at $1.2, now close to $1. I haven’t sold yet because their recommendations are usually solid—like $RGTI, with a 12x return I still can’t get over!
While I missed some opportunities, this year has shown that my overall strategy is on the right track. I can now identify lows more clearly, but recognizing the highs still challenges my understanding.

What will 2025 bring? I still have a lot to learn.

22,SMCI,2.5 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks,"I bought the dip on several 'pandemic stocks' that had significant declines (70%+) in 2022 and started sharing public updates 1-2 times a year.

In Q3 2023 I began reallocating into AI-related stocks when I developed strong conviction. I'm also working on a self-funded AI startup, which keeps me in the loop on AI.

Returns have been strong and continue to give me the runway to work on my startup and support my family after leaving my corporate tech job. There's more context in my previous updates linked below.

(*\*) Short term capital gain/loss held for &lt;1yr*

I held several companies (\*) for a short time to spread out my AI bets, but some of the increasingly high P/E ratios concerned me (PLTR, TSLA, etc.).

So, I sold them and purchased more NVIDIA. This approach is considered risky, but I have strong conviction in their relative valuation, defensibility, and long-term prospects.

In this case I believe that 'diversification' among AI stocks would do more to dilute my returns than mitigate my risks. Particularly because they're all highly correlated and despite its market cap, Nvidia has the most reasonable valuation all things considered. We'll see if the bet pays off.

To clarify, I am confident in the long-term prospects of Palantir, Tesla, and others, but I'm just not comfortable with the valuations. I may reassess in the future when I have new information or valuations change.

Meta is the only other stock I held onto, given my bullish view on their AI and hardware strategy combined with their attractive valuation.

# Unrealized (current investments)

* **Meta (META):** \+367.97%
* **Nvidia (NVDA):** \+117.05%

Nvidia's performance here is understated since I recently increased my holdings, but it's up \~200% since I initially purchased it last year after dithering for months.

These returns are less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I’d like to maintain some anonymity around it.

# Rate of return (IRR)

My annual return (IRR) for this portfolio (Jun 2022 to Dec 2024) is **73.6%**.

# Investment thesis

See a summary of my investment thesis in a [previous update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/). **TL;DR:**

&gt;“…AI is another secular trend like PCs (Windows, Mac), the internet (browsers, search, social) and mobile (iOS, Android, wearables). The difference is that new technology like AI can now spread faster than ever before and get used in new ways. Every new epoch uniquely benefits from the past, potentially bending the growth curve in new ways.

&gt;The other difference is that Nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation. Therefore, the \~350% run up over the last 12 months doesn’t make NVIDIA the stock of the last year, but rather it’s the stock of the next decade. The recent 3X gain will be a blip compared to what’s coming thanks to NVIDIA’s CUDA (moat), among [other things](https://stratechery.com/2023/nvidia-on-the-mountaintop/).”

# Nvidia's dominance

I'm still working through my thoughts here, but my strong conviction around Nvidia comes in part from these observations:

* Nvidia is [founder-led](https://www.amazon.com/Nvidia-Way-Jensen-Huang-Making/dp/1324086718/) and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies.
* It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage.
* This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy.
* AI will consistently make software easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now).
* Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints.

# We still underestimate the AI opportunity

Most importantly, we’ve barely scratched the surface of AI’s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find.

We have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before.

# Final thoughts

I'm still well within the '*maybe I'm just lucky*' phase since it's only been a couple years. Towards the end of [my last update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1d758m7/2_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/) I also shared a few ways my investment approach has changed, which I’m still benefiting from.

I expect my next update to be the 3-year update in mid 2025.

34,SMCI,MicroStrategy secures Nasdaq-100 inclusion after bitcoin-fueled stock surge,"**Dec 13 (Reuters)** \- MicroStrategy ([MSTR](https://www.reuters.com/markets/microstrategy/)) will be added to the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 Index, the exchange operator said on Friday, following a meteoric surge in the shares of the bitcoin buyer.

The change takes effect before the market opens on **Dec. 23**, Nasdaq announced.

Inclusion in the index typically boosts the stock's price, as exchange-traded funds (ETFs) replicating the index's performance buy shares of newly included firms.

Data analytics firm **Palantir Technologies (**[**PLTR**](https://www.reuters.com/markets/palantir-technologies/)**)** and Taser maker **Axon Enterprise (**[**AXON**](https://www.reuters.com/markets/axon-enterprise/)**)** were also added to the Nasdaq-100 Index along with MicroStrategy. Meanwhile, **Illumina (**[**ILMN**](https://www.reuters.com/markets/illumina/)**)**, AI server maker **Super Micro Computer (**[**SMCI**](https://www.reuters.com/markets/super-micro-computer/)**)**, and vaccine maker **Moderna (**[**MRNA**](https://www.reuters.com/markets/moderna/)**)** were removed, Nasdaq stated.

MicroStrategy, an aggressive investor in Bitcoin, has seen its shares soar more than six-fold this year, bringing its market value to nearly **$94 billion**.

The company started purchasing and holding Bitcoin in 2020 as revenue from its software business waned, making it the largest corporate holder of the cryptocurrency.

Analysts have noted that MicroStrategy's Bitcoin strategy has boosted the appeal of its stock, which often aligns with the cryptocurrency's performance.

Bernstein analysts predict that **S&amp;P 500 inclusion** could be on the horizon for MicroStrategy by 2025 following the Nasdaq-100 inclusion. They also anticipate the company's prospects will improve next year, highlighting ""more visibility and recognition beyond fresh ETF inflows"" due to the Nasdaq-100 inclusion.

Bitcoin has surged in recent weeks, fueled by expectations of easing regulatory roadblocks under the upcoming administration. Earlier this month, Bitcoin surpassed **$100,000** for the first time.

""Management has shown no signs of slowing this (Bitcoin-buying) down and are comfortable buying Bitcoin in the $95K-$100K range,"" Bernstein analysts said.

MicroStrategy held approximately **423,650 bitcoins**, purchased for about **$25.6 billion** (average purchase price) as of Dec. 8. The investment is now worth around **$42.43 billion**, based on Bitcoin's recent close, according to Reuters calculations.

**Thoughts:**

Overall pretty interesting article, the Bitcoin premium is roughly around 2.26x to NAV. If there are more serious dislocations (like when we saw greater than 3x and MSTR was trading around $545) the stock could be worth trading again on the short side. More future catalysts for this inbound- article mentions that the company will set sights on S&amp;P Inclusion as well. Other actions the company can take when dislocation gets ridiculous is to do an offering and bring that NAV premium back in-line to something more rational. Worth game-planning for, for future trades.

**Other tangential idea:** Some of MSTR's wallet addresses are known, (not sure if we know all of them, however). The stock likely spikes when they make major buys with their wallet and prior to their announcement of having bought more, because those announcements have spiked up the stock in the past. There's probably some small time frame that you can front-run the announcement.

""Management has shown no signs of slowing this (Bitcoin-buying) down and are comfortable buying Bitcoin in the $95K-$100K range,"" Bernstein analysts said.

MicroStrategy held approximately **423,650 bitcoins**, purchased for about **$25.6 billion** (average purchase price) as of Dec. 8. The investment is now worth around **$42.43 billion**, based on Bitcoin's recent close, according to Reuters calculations.

**Thoughts:**

Overall pretty interesting article, the Bitcoin premium is roughly around 2.26x to NAV. If there are more serious dislocations (like when we saw greater than 3x and MSTR was trading around $545) the stock could be worth trading again on the short side. More future catalysts for this inbound- article mentions that the company will set sights on S&amp;P Inclusion as well. Other actions the company can take when dislocation gets ridiculous is to do an offering and bring that NAV premium back in-line to something more rational. Worth game-planning for, for future trades.

**Other tangential idea:** Some of MSTR's wallet addresses are known, (not sure if we know all of them, however). The stock likely spikes when they make major buys with their wallet and prior to their announcement of having bought more, because those announcements have spiked up the stock in the past. There's probably some small time frame that you can front-run the announcement. ",0.7172101736068726,0.03051791898906231,0.2522718906402588,positive,0.7172101736068726,0.6866922546178102

The firm will present you with the basic facts about NVDA, not as, and never as, a financial recommendation, but as an introduction to its financials, to give you a better idea if it's even worth your time to further explore NVDA as a company and potential vehicle of investment. The firm does not want you to be falsely misled into thinking we can offer you expertise on NVDA, we cannot. We can however answer the questions that we would expect any man who'd risk his capital to answer. How much money does NVDA make? How much do they have? And you would think, most importantly, how much has NVDA paid their previous investors so far? And while we don't believe the answers to these questions to justify investment, this firm adamantly believes that not knowing the answers to these questions is unacceptable for those who do or would choose to buy common stock in NVDA. 

In short, you'd have to be a fucking idiot to lend your money to a company without reading our charts and commentary, or the equivalent there of. To assess the full risk of NVDA however, will require a much deeper dive than a single blog post can provide.

Let’s take a look at what investors were thinking during the ChatGPT hype and whether that investment panned out at a fundamental rather than speculative level. In other words, did NVDA actually make more money or did its share price just go up?

https://imgur.com/wRnNWlD

This graph shows what percentage of NVDA’s share price was being represented by the money it had made (ttm net income/shares/share price). This 10 year low during 2023, shows unequivically that there was in fact investment hype during this time, that the price per earnings went very high as people were willing to accept less than 1% earnings just to get in on the hype. Why would investors accept such low earnings per dollar? Because these investors anticipated that the rapid adoption of ChatGPT and the AI hype around it, would mean a growth for NVDA that would more than make up for the price they paid. So were they dumb? Did they overpay? Let’s find out! 

For our example, we’ll imagine an investor that bought sometime in February after the 100m user threshold was announced:

February 15th, 2023
  $22.75 price
  $0.175 net income
  $0.175/$22.75 = ~0.8% 


December 10th, 2024
  ~$2.57 net income
  $2.57/$22.17 = ~11% 


If an investor had bought sometime in February after the news of the 100m users was released. Let’s say for example February 15th at a closing price of approximately $22.75 per share they would have bought when NVDA’s trailing twelve month net income was about $0.175 (17.5 cents) per share, or about 0.8% of the price of the share at that time. Today, those same shares carry about $2.57 per share, a wopping 10x increase (almost 15 actually) in just 2 years. $2.57/$22.75 = ~11%, which means investors that bought in on the AI hype are already seeing the net income of their shares exceed the growth rate of the money supply (M2), which is about 7-8%. Meaning that NVDA isn’t just earning more dollars, its earning a greater share of the economic pie, and in a world where profits are actually returned to investors, would mean beating inflation (at least from a micro perspective). Now whether this cash that NVDA is reporting to generate will ever actually make it back to the shareholder is another story.

Now that we’ve seen that buying (even when the fundamental value of the shares was at its lowest) has paid off, let’s take a look at how much money NVDA actually has:

https://imgur.com/VSPPMhj
https://imgur.com/6KPxWte

As you can see, NVDA has almost no money relative to its price. The market’s pricing of NVDA is derived principally from the money it is supposed to make in the future, rather than the present value of the company.

This is not what the firm would deem a good fundamental investment. Why? Because one would be paying a future price for future value, rather than the current price for its current value. Furthermore, the market is a game of desperation, and if shareholders are desperate for money, they should be offering their shares below the liquidation value of the company. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush after all. 

However, if one understands that NVDA’s price has been based on the growth of its earnings, and if one can also see that the growth of said earnings has gone up, but its stock price has gone down (as is the case for NVDA at the time of this post ~$135) then one could speculate that the market will not only price NVDA’s earnings higher than they are currently being priced, but that the market will actually price its earnings higher than in the previous quarters unless the market believes that NVDA’s future growth will be lower. The firm believes that within the next 3 months, NVDA will almost certainly attain new all time highs. In fact, we believe the passive participant in the market, will be genuinely surprised by how high the price of NVDA will go. At the time of this post, the firm has no positions in NVDA. An associate of the firm has exposure to NVDA through long options on the SNP500. A position the firm feels is not worth mentioning as longing the SNP500 might as well be a long on inflation.

So NVDA has made all this money? How much of that money has been returned to shareholders? 
https://imgur.com/RANJVwo

As you can see by that line at the bottom, almost none. About half of the money has been spent on share buybacks and when the company’s evaluation is 50x the money that it makes and 50x the money that it has, these buybacks only break even once the company has actually grown 50x (less so if you’re only evaluating the company on past earnings and not the amount of money it actually has, in this case, you might only want a 5x to consider yourself breaking even) . I’d much rather have my money now and use it to make more money, than wait around for NVDA to 50x. But NVDA doesnt give shareholders the option of how to spend their own money or how to evaluate the company. They don’t give the money to the shareholder to decide whether they want to wait for a 50x gain on NVDA. They’ve decided they’ll spend it for you. Not on growing the company or acquiring others, but by buying their own stock. 

Now that we can understand a basic view of NVDA’s finances and how it relates to its price, let’s take a glance at some of the more sinister aspects of NVDA.

First is this little tidbit the firm discovered while reading NVDA’s Q2 filing:
https://imgur.com/b438cbJ

NVDA expects you to follow **ALL**  6 of its listed social media accounts and will be leaving out material information in its 10Q and 10k filings that will only be available in its listed social media accounts. This is clearly unethical, and our firm at this time questions whether this intent to distribute exclusive material information across 6 different channels is even legal. Though we do not have the legal training or background to make a claim one way or the other, we would like to assume that the system in place would not allow such a thing.

Now lets throw a bone to the hardware guys. If you’ve never heard of Moore’s Law, you can skip this section as trying to understand what Moore’s Law means will get in the way of seeing the blatant contradiction between NVDA’s CEO and his company’s own SEC filings. For your time:

   Moore's Law is the observation that the  number of transistors in an integrated circuit doubles about every two years.

   The observation is named after Gordon Moore, the co-founder of Fairchild Semiconductor and Intel

   From Wikipedia: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore's_law


So why is the firm bringing up Moore’s Law? We don’t even know what half that sentence means, and we certainly wouldnt be able to explain the nuances of NVDA’s hardware products. Well, there’s one thing we do know, it’s how to bullshit. So let’s wind back the clocks to the end of 2022. September. Right before entering Q4.

“Moore’s Law’s dead,” Huang said, “And the ability for Moore’s Law to deliver twice the performance at the same cost, or at the same performance, half the cost, every year and a half, is over. It’s completely over, and so the idea that a chip is going to go down in cost over time, unfortunately, is a story of the past.”

Source: https://www.marketwatch.com/story/moores-laws-dead-nvidia-ceo-jensen-says-in-justifying-gaming-card-price-hike-11663798618



Ok, so going into Q4, Moore’s Law is dead. The CEO said it’s over baby. Rapid growth is a thing of the past. That means the market should be lowering its growth expectations for NVDA right?

https://imgur.com/VSPPMhj
https://imgur.com/6KPxWte

But it did the opposite. Investors were willing to pay more for less, implying they actually expected NVDA’s long term growth rate to increase not decrease. Almost as if the market knew what NVDA would end up publishing in its Q4 filing:

Source: https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001045810/000104581023000017/nvda-20230129.htm

(10k filed Feb 24, 2023)

So not only did the company contradict the CEO’s statements made in the September prior to the reported quarter, now theyre actually ahead of Moore’s law, and according to them, giving the entire industry a path forward. What the fuck. 🤣

And to finish things off, we’ll put on our tin foil hats. The firm does not know how to verify the veracity of the following information. 

There has been a short report put out by Hindenburg Research regarding SMCI:

    https://hindenburgresearch.com/smci/



The firm has no idea if the information reported is true. So this last section is just for fun. If the information in the report is true, then the firm would conclude that it paints the picture that SMCI has been funneling money out of the company into other companies, out of shareholder hands, into the hands of insiders and their network of family and friends. SMCI’s biggest customer? NVDA. In other words, if the allegations are accurate, the biggest chunk of money that SMCI funneled out came from NVDA. So it’s really not outside the realm of possibility that NVDA was intentionally buying from SMCI knowing where the money was ending up. The firm is not in the practice of lawsuits or building criminal cases. So the firm cannot and has no intention of doing so here for you now. The firm, however, is also not stupid. And the fact that all this money the company is making is not ending up in shareholders pockets, really isnt helping the “management would never steal from shareholders” fantasy that many would like to be the truism that must be disproved with mountains of evidence. It should have to be proven that the money is being returned to investors, not the other way around. When the vast majority of the profits dont go to the investors, which we can see from the dividend chart, but get spent on buybacks at 50x multiples, well people start to listen when accusations start to be made about money being funneled into other companies.

We’ve learned a lot. We’ve seen the impressive growth of NVDA’s earnings and how they relate to its price and the general hype around AI. We’ve shown that the company has barely any money at all and is being priced on future earnings. We’ve shown where some of this money is going. And we even got to put on our conspiracy hats for a little bit. 

And that is our fundamental analysis of NVDA, the AI giant. The good, the bad, and the fugly. Thanks for tuning in.

The firm is not in the practice of lawsuits or building criminal cases. So the firm cannot and has no intention of doing so here for you now. The firm, however, is also not stupid. And the fact that all this money the company is making is not ending up in shareholders pockets, really isnt helping the “management would never steal from shareholders” fantasy that many would like to be the truism that must be disproved with mountains of evidence. It should have to be proven that the money is being returned to investors, not the other way around. When the vast majority of the profits dont go to the investors, which we can see from the dividend chart, but get spent on buybacks at 50x multiples, well people start to listen when accusations start to be made about money being funneled into other companies.

We’ve learned a lot. We’ve seen the impressive growth of NVDA’s earnings and how they relate to its price and the general hype around AI. We’ve shown that the company has barely any money at all and is being priced on future earnings. We’ve shown where some of this money is going. And we even got to put on our conspiracy hats for a little bit. 

And that is our fundamental analysis of NVDA, the AI giant. The good, the bad, and the fugly. Thanks for tuning in.

* Rubrik does the above and sells at-cost servers from partners like Dell, HPE, SMCI, etc. They protect data in places like AWS , Azure, and GCP.

After hours Friday SMCI jumped almost 9 percent! Makes perfect sense that investors are flooding back into this stock! It has been so beaten down over the last six months by bad press and fears of fraud. Those fears have been quelled by a new CFO and auditing team. 

We just saw in the last month of 72% rally and there is still plenty of room to run on Monday it will open up around $48, the last critical level we saw was $49.

Also, it looks like a somewhat sloppy cup and handle pattern is forming. My half baked technical analysis is. We will see a minor pull back around $50 to finish the pattern, then it will launch back up to the next critical level around $60 a share. 

Fundamentally speaking, they have been showing plenty of growth and demand for their products which mainly consists of hardware to House semiconductors, especially their trademark marked water cooled rack, which directly addresses a huge issue that centers are facing as computing power gets to Skynet levels. Their price to earnings ratio is a modest 21.9, the earnings per share is a humble 2, the ps ratio is 1.5 which is the lowest among its competitors. In fact all of its metrics or lowest amongst its competitors except for the EPS for AMD, which is 1.1. 

There will be much to see within the next quarterly earnings report and how they managed to address their auditing issues and reporting issues. But I think this company still has room to run and definitely has legs.

I have 200 shares with plans to buy much more. I was going to buy on the next red day, expecting it to be Monday, but I digress.

I had a November 210-contract iron condor on SMCI I created on Oct 6th... Got assigned on 108 contracts at 37 when MP dipped to 17.40.  Holding 10,800 shares, have 108 x Dec 20th 50 CCs at $2.4.

Should I... Or would you:
* Just ride it out, have my shares get assigned (gains would be $206K since October 6th),
* Roll it to a higher January (or later) strike where premium is the same as current premium on my 50s? If so, would I do that right away since on Monday there will only be 12 days until expiry, or when there appears to be resistance, or at expiration?
* Is there a spread I could create and would that be created now or at the last minute? Like a delta 1 bull call or bear call spread at market close on Dec 20? Or I could buy 108 50Ps I gather.

**Why write this?**   

* I feel like we need a solid fucking company.
* I get too scared to buy aviation, nuclear, and crypto stocks.
* They weren’t listed on WSB’s Earnings board.
* I thought more people would like the YOLO.
* They POSSIBLY gave me a backpack when I was MAYBE working with them eight years ago.

[Rubrik Backpack](https://preview.redd.it/aq0rogvya55e1.png?width=628&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7dc549da0311f723117c74e29efa2136085b9e84)

**DD Research**

**What is Rubrik ?** 

* Rubrik is a backup &amp; recovery provider that sits on top of a company’s cloud infrastructure.

**What is an example of Backup &amp; Recovery I can maybe understand?** 

* You drop your phone under a tire because you were to busy while parking, leading to a smashing of both it and the SIM card. The only fix is you buy a new phone, login with your iCloud email, and everything is restored from the cloud.
* Rubrik does the above and sells at-cost servers from partners like Dell, HPE, SMCI, etc. They protect data in places like AWS , Azure, and GCP.
* People pay whatever when they have no phone or car. Same here.

**How are you qualified?** 

* I worked at a research company for five years partnering with SaaS vendors $5M-$250M, for two of those years I CAN NEITHER CONFIRM NOR DENY they may have been a client.
* I transitioned to Software Engineering three years ago from Tech Sales. I have tracked them and understand both the sales pitch and technology pitch. 
* I saw them masterfully navigate researchers, which they still do, and become the golden child. Billions of dollars get validated by researchers.... it's importants.
   * [(Updated) They Poached the Magic in 2018](https://www.theregister.com/2018/05/01/rubrik_gartner_hires/). One is doable but not three of them it delayed the research paper a year that doesn’t happen unless a research analyst dies.
   * [(Updated) Because of 2018 poaching the late Fall report never got published (major delay), The 2019 Report Was Fought Back By Rubrik for Flawed Data](https://www.crn.com/news/storage/rubrik-ceo-gartner-data-center-magic-quadrant-seriously-flawed) . I've never seen a CEO do this without blowback Bipul again with a killer move.
   * TL:DR; They were making moves YEARS ago. See article excerpt below.

[This is pretty rare, vendors complain but not publishing a document read by 4k+ CIO controlling the flow of billions of dollars in a sector. It's just insane. There's a lot of big names backing them. ](https://preview.redd.it/x3hcumds365e1.png?width=1152&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f1e26b7a5f66134efaf4447b77fa18f020f0837)

**Who’s in the market? Competitors?** 

https://preview.redd.it/qq3hhafdg55e1.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20d4d8a57db7467d15ffd2abaa24459d6ac8d60c

* Their only publicly traded competitor is Commvault which is around $170 and dropping.
* Veeam and Cohesity are private firms with very different architectures, support qualities, and applications. Rubrik is the only one fully doing what it does. They are considered the “Lexus”

**How are they different?** 

* Rubrik views backup and recovery very differently from legacy vendors. They built their architecture based on expecting to get hacked (Backup &amp; Recovery) vs. trying to prevent a hack (Incident Response). It's never been done ""their way"" before.
* Rubrik creates an air gapped layer on top of databases that - even if a hacker gets in they’re quarantined and the user can restore the system cutting them off. Thus less downtime, less support costs, payroll, legal fees, etc.
* They are very partner friendly with Mandiant, Crowdstrike, and Zscaler at least in the cutthroat cyber industry. 
* Rubrik’s leadership , in particular the CEO Bipul Sinha, are not run of the mill. Bipul is personally a very kind, measured, and calculated leader, I’ve met him before. He’s a lovely man but a killer. He’s an engineer with a sales streak like Elon. Bipul has Nutanix and Bromium under his belt. Google Him. He essentially came out of retirement for this company from a cushy ass VC job. 
* They know how to pitch investors, analysts, sales people, clients, basically everyone. They’re as buttoned up as you get and they come to impress. They earned their street cred 100%. 
* They have consistently ranked as #1 according to Gartner in the Magic Quadrant. Beating out companies with very, very large balance sheets that don't have the balls to IPO in 2024.

**Why the sudden pop? (Things I thought were important)** 

* Analysts needed another leap to profitability  due to the only available historicals  being from the April 2024 IPO and September Q2 earnings. This gave them pause on profitability as Rubrik as high operating margin.
* They raised 2025 Guidance. Indicated profitability by end of next year on this Q3 Earnings.
* Things I Heard on their Q3 Earnings today:
   * They mentioned a Fortune 50 Healthcare company selecting them in a competitive win. UnitedHealthcare was hacked in February and had offline billing systems for like 20 days. I’m thinking they signed UNH, that’s a big cookie boys. It’s super fucking hard to rip and replace a legacy vendor. 
   * They passed $1B in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR). This is a big metric. I heard both the Goldman Sachs and Barclays analysts say “Congrats” they seemed to be teeing up easier questions.   
* [Everyone and their mother in Cybersecurity has heard of Rubrik. They got the same award as Google, Facebook, and others a month ago for Entrepreneurship](https://www.rubrik.com/company/newsroom/press-releases/24/rubrik-named-the-2024-entrepreneurial-company-of-the-year-by-the-harvard-business-school-hbs-association-of-northern-california) 
* [This guy’s comment from 6 days ago. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h2q6pw/comment/lzm990m/)

**Why did the stock not move from April to September 2024? (Timeline Below...)**

* **April 24th 2024 IPO Financials**
   *  Rubrik reveals a very high operating margin due to sales and marketing investments aka ripping out Zscaler’s sales team doing the “Salesforce” push. Blitzkreg the market. 
   * I believe they started  planning ripping Zscaler in October 2023 , it takes time to ramp up. They probably got all big sales hires in by March with a six month ramp up take lands sales quotes around September when the stock crept up(
   * [Sniping Zscaler Executives and Top Earners in October 2023. They had to give a fuck ton of stock to pry these boys away. ](https://channeleye.co.uk/rubrik-hires-another-zscaler/)
   * [EDIT: (Updated with New Video) This lead to analyst skepticism about pricing controls. ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzEhqtSrVUE) 
* **Septemeber 9th 2024 Q2 Earnings Financials** 
   * Earnings were month after the late July 2024 Crowdstrike hack, I do not think Rubrik was able to accelerate deal velocity to report ARR high enough to relieve market analysts and critics of the operating margin. They were asked about “deal velocity” by analysts today and it seems like the markets are pleased. 
   * [Bloomberg video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGvI0QbzzkY) from post-earnings is killer and a good recap of market sentiment.
   * [Rubrik Search Trends Peaked In April Coinciding With the Major UNH Hack; however, they droped off after the huge spike.](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;q=rubrik&amp;hl=en)
      * I think analysts expected a quicker deal cycle around the UNH hack, 4 months/120 days is a very fast enterprise sales cycle. Most large sales deals can take 6-12 months if not longer.
* **October 2024:** 
   * I believe deal velocity picked up from the UNH hack and even with low search results, the three week hack fallout was enough to start sales cycles. Then from the Crowdstrike fallout, even as a partner, highlighted the need to immediately solve it as publicly traded companies were literally offline, no one working.
   * Remember 60-120 days is a very fast sales cycle on any software sale. I think this is where we started heating up here as this is three months out from the hack.  
   * Today on earnings analysts seemed eager to ask about profitability as the CFO and CEO were comfortable to voice the 2026 is the year. Look there's alot of tech companies with -40 EPS floating around. It's not 2013-2018 you can't float on negative earnings and millions of users. &lt;--- the market is speaking, you have to make money as a tech company.
* **November 2024:** 
   * Rising cybersecurity risk from election, TikTok hack, etc. Fidelity even paused my money for four weeks in a CMA because they had security issues with fraud. 
   * Stock was ticking up.
* **December 4th, 2024  (Yesterday):**
   * Veeam $2B announcement mentioned earlier.
   * Volume doubles to nearly 2M. It was 700k in July 2024. It's 4M Today. Nuts.

**Why write this?**   

* I feel like we need a solid fucking company.
* I get too scared to buy aviation, nuclear, and crypto stocks.
* They weren’t listed on WSB’s Earnings board.
* I thought more people would like the YOLO.
* They POSSIBLY gave me a backpack when I was MAYBE working with them eight years ago.

[Rubrik Backpack](https://preview.redd.it/aq0rogvya55e1.png?width=628&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7dc549da0311f723117c74e29efa2136085b9e84)

**DD Research**

**What is Rubrik ?** 

* Rubrik is a backup &amp; recovery provider that sits on top of a company’s cloud infrastructure.

**What is an example of Backup &amp; Recovery I can maybe understand?** 

* You drop your phone under a tire because you were to busy while parking, leading to a smashing of both it and the SIM card. The only fix is you buy a new phone, login with your iCloud email, and everything is restored from the cloud.
* Rubrik does the above and sells at-cost servers from partners like Dell, HPE, SMCI, etc. They protect data in places like AWS , Azure, and GCP.
* People pay whatever when they have no phone or car. Same here.

**How are you qualified?** 

* I worked at a research company for five years partnering with SaaS vendors $5M-$250M, for two of those years I CAN NEITHER CONFIRM NOR DENY they may have been a client.
* I transitioned to Software Engineering three years ago from Tech Sales. I have tracked them and understand both the sales pitch and technology pitch. 
* I saw them masterfully navigate researchers, which they still do, and become the golden child. Billions of dollars get validated by researchers.... it's importants.
   * [(Updated) They Poached the Magic in 2018](https://www.theregister.com/2018/05/01/rubrik_gartner_hires/). One is doable but not three of them it delayed the research paper a year that doesn’t happen unless a research analyst dies.
   * [(Updated) Because of 2018 poaching the late Fall report never got published (major delay), The 2019 Report Was Fought Back By Rubrik for Flawed Data](https://www.crn.com/news/storage/rubrik-ceo-gartner-data-center-magic-quadrant-seriously-flawed) . I've never seen a CEO do this without blowback Bipul again with a killer move.
   * TL:DR; They were making moves YEARS ago. See article excerpt below.

[This is pretty rare, vendors complain but not publishing a document read by 4k+ CIO controlling the flow of billions of dollars in a sector. It's just insane. There's a lot of big names backing them. ](https://preview.redd.it/x3hcumds365e1.png?width=1152&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f1e26b7a5f66134efaf4447b77fa18f020f0837)

**Who’s in the market? Competitors?** 

https://preview.redd.it/qq3hhafdg55e1.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20d4d8a57db7467d15ffd2abaa24459d6ac8d60c

* Their only publicly traded competitor is Commvault which is around $170 and dropping.
* Veeam and Cohesity are private firms with very different architectures, support qualities, and applications. Rubrik is the only one fully doing what it does. They are considered the “Lexus”

**How are they different?** 

* Rubrik views backup and recovery very differently from legacy vendors. They built their architecture based on expecting to get hacked (Backup &amp; Recovery) vs. trying to prevent a hack (Incident Response). It's never been done ""their way"" before.
* Rubrik creates an air gapped layer on top of databases that - even if a hacker gets in they’re quarantined and the user can restore the system cutting them off. Thus less downtime, less support costs, payroll, legal fees, etc.
* They are very partner friendly with Mandiant, Crowdstrike, and Zscaler at least in the cutthroat cyber industry. 
* Rubrik’s leadership , in particular the CEO Bipul Sinha, are not run of the mill. Bipul is personally a very kind, measured, and calculated leader, I’ve met him before. He’s a lovely man but a killer. He’s an engineer with a sales streak like Elon. Bipul has Nutanix and Bromium under his belt. Google Him. He essentially came out of retirement for this company from a cushy ass VC job. 
* They know how to pitch investors, analysts, sales people, clients, basically everyone. They’re as buttoned up as you get and they come to impress. They earned their street cred 100%. 
* They have consistently ranked as #1 according to Gartner in the Magic Quadrant. Beating out companies with very, very large balance sheets that don't have the balls to IPO in 2024.

**Why the sudden pop? (Things I thought were important)** 

* Analysts needed another leap to profitability  due to the only available historicals  being from the April 2024 IPO and September Q2 earnings. This gave them pause on profitability as Rubrik as high operating margin.
* They raised 2025 Guidance. Indicated profitability by end of next year on this Q3 Earnings.
* Things I Heard on their Q3 Earnings today:
   * They mentioned a Fortune 50 Healthcare company selecting them in a competitive win. UnitedHealthcare was hacked in February and had offline billing systems for like 20 days. I’m thinking they signed UNH, that’s a big cookie boys. It’s super fucking hard to rip and replace a legacy vendor. 
   * They passed $1B in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR). This is a big metric. I heard both the Goldman Sachs and Barclays analysts say “Congrats” they seemed to be teeing up easier questions.   
* [Everyone and their mother in Cybersecurity has heard of Rubrik. They got the same award as Google, Facebook, and others a month ago for Entrepreneurship](https://www.rubrik.com/company/newsroom/press-releases/24/rubrik-named-the-2024-entrepreneurial-company-of-the-year-by-the-harvard-business-school-hbs-association-of-northern-california)

**Why did the stock not move from April to September 2024? (Timeline Below...)**

* **April 24th 2024 IPO Financials**
   *  Rubrik reveals a very high operating margin due to sales and marketing investments aka ripping out Zscaler’s sales team doing the “Salesforce” push. Blitzkreg the market. 
   * I believe they started  planning ripping Zscaler in October 2023 , it takes time to ramp up. They probably got all big sales hires in by March with a six month ramp up take lands sales quotes around September when the stock crept up(
   * [Sniping Zscaler Executives and Top Earners in October 2023. They had to give a fuck ton of stock to pry these boys away. ](https://channeleye.co.uk/rubrik-hires-another-zscaler/)
   * [EDIT: (Updated with New Video) This lead to analyst skepticism about pricing controls. ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzEhqtSrVUE) 
* **Septemeber 9th 2024 Q2 Earnings Financials** 
   * Earnings were month after the late July 2024 Crowdstrike hack, I do not think Rubrik was able to accelerate deal velocity to report ARR high enough to relieve market analysts and critics of the operating margin. They were asked about “deal velocity” by analysts today and it seems like the markets are pleased. 
   * [Bloomberg video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGvI0QbzzkY) from post-earnings is killer and a good recap of market sentiment.
   * [Rubrik Search Trends Peaked In April Coinciding With the Major UNH Hack; however, they droped off after the huge spike.](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;q=rubrik&amp;hl=en)
      * I think analysts expected a quicker deal cycle around the UNH hack, 4 months/120 days is a very fast enterprise sales cycle. Most large sales deals can take 6-12 months if not longer.
* **October 2024:** 
   * I believe deal velocity picked up from the UNH hack and even with low search results, the three week hack fallout was enough to start sales cycles. Then from the Crowdstrike fallout, even as a partner, highlighted the need to immediately solve it as publicly traded companies were literally offline, no one working.
   * Remember 60-120 days is a very fast sales cycle on any software sale. I think this is where we started heating up here as this is three months out from the hack.  
   * Today on earnings analysts seemed eager to ask about profitability as the CFO and CEO were comfortable to voice the 2026 is the year. Look there's alot of tech companies with -40 EPS floating around. It's not 2013-2018 you can't float on negative earnings and millions of users. &lt;--- the market is speaking, you have to make money as a tech company.
* **November 2024:** 
   * Rising cybersecurity risk from election, TikTok hack, etc. Fidelity even paused my money for four weeks in a CMA because they had security issues with fraud. 
   * Stock was ticking up.
* **December 4th, 2024  (Yesterday):**
   * Veeam $2B announcement mentioned earlier.
   * Volume doubles to nearly 2M. It was 700k in July 2024. It's 4M Today. Nuts.

111,SMCI,SMCI - value or trap?,"I have seen many post about SMCI and highlighting its potential undervalued qualities. Many see it *growing* to $160 a share, but in a crowd of bulls I will be one of the bears on the company. 

Whenever one wants to get a feel for what the priorities of a company are one should look no further than how executives are rewarded. CEO Charles Liang went from a salary + options package prior to 2021 to a $1.00 salary &amp; pure options/RSU package in March of 2021 when the **2021 CEO Performance Package** was passed. Interesting timing given the boom in the AI markets. Mr. Liang cannot have his salary or other cash  comp adjusted until June 30th, 2026.

One of the KPI's was based around none other than share price appreciation. The package was awarded and set at a share price of $34.08 and the goals were broken into five tranches with the highest being $120 a share and all this needed to be hit by September 30th, 2026. This would have been a CAGR of 25% over ~5.5 years but lucky for SMCI shareholders this was achieved in ~2.2 years for a 75% CAGR. 

In November 2023 the compensation package was adjusted with the approval of the **2023 CEO Compensation Package** where SMCI was again lucky enough to achieve almost all goals on share price appreciation on these new tranches too. 

Their CFO had no KPI's around the company's health. Nothing regarding leverage ratios, operating income, cash flow generation, but three KPI's that were 1) share price appreciation (2X weighted), long-term investor increase (2X weighted), and an individual performance measured by Mr. Liang. The CFO being rewarded heavily on share price appreciation and attractive investing should be a red flag. And while the CFO achieved these goals in such a short time, he has now been rewarded with losing his job. One must ask why?

Another target is around revenue growth and while any company should be focused on revenue, the above KPI's highlight a culture that is focused on driving share price appreciation before all else. There is an active whistleblower lawsuit stating SMCI improperly recognized revenue and just today that same whistleblower doubled down on such claims. 

December 5th, 2023 SMCI made a public offering of 2,415,805 shares, then they went and issued convertible notes in February 2024, then on March 22nd, 2024 they went and issued another round of equity for 2,000,000 shares. All of this equity at a time when executives are rewarded for share price gains.

The Ablecom/Compuware relationship has been called out and I think it should have more attention. There is a lot of PO movement between these companies that are all owned by relatives. These two companies also handle design work, tool builds, and various other things; do we know where all the debt lies and perhaps CAPEX is understated as it's absorbed elsewhere? Impossible to say either way given we can't get public financials for these other organizations. No comment from SMCI leaves investors left to speculate. 

Now we get to the recent news of EY resigning. I have seen some estimates that EY was walking from multiple million dollar deal in being the auditor for SMCI, what did they see? Given the trouble EY has had over the past few years with a failed split and SEC fines, walking away from a potential AI darling account seems very difficult to understand. In the 8-K statement filed by SMCI, EY was quoted as ***""we are resigning due to information that has recently come to our attention which has led us to no longer be able to rely on management's and the Audit Committee’s representations and to be unwilling to be associated with the financial statements prepared by management, and after concluding we can no longer provide the Audit Services in accordance with applicable law or professional obligations.”***, which is no light statement. Yet, an internal investigation by SMCI finds nothing that aligned with what EY found? No discrepancy at all? This investigation by SMCI was led by someone who is now a board member, but of course Mr. Market rallies on the news of ""no fault"" but the pieces do not fit.

The recent cancellations of two bank facilities should also raise red flags. It is clear if you read the terms that SMCI was in violation of debt covenants and would have been in default, but these terminations now constrict liquidity. SMCI has stated they will possibly need these lending facilities to fund inventory as they see growth, but because of these filings delays and auditor resignations they cancelled them. I am not seeing many talk about the future growth constraints from this move. It also highlights there may be more here because why not work with the banks? Unless of course you have no intention of filing your 10-K/Q anytime soon or there is true risks on what BDO finds. 

While the above may indeed be nothing, I am having a hard time reading the recent events as bullish. While a self audit is good show and will likely prevent a delisting, the delayed 10-K/Q gives investors no insight into where the company stands. It is possible BDO will begin their audit and find gaps the same as EY. The equity offerings at a time when executives are rewarded for share price appreciation also is a red flag from an investor POV as your dilution is funding direct reward. The MOAT for SMCI is not as strong as many state and the margins are not either.

I have seen many post about SMCI and highlighting its potential undervalued qualities. Many see it *growing* to $160 a share, but in a crowd of bulls I will be one of the bears on the company. 

Whenever one wants to get a feel for what the priorities of a company are one should look no further than how executives are rewarded. CEO Charles Liang went from a salary + options package prior to 2021 to a $1.00 salary &amp; pure options/RSU package in March of 2021 when the **2021 CEO Performance Package** was passed. Interesting timing given the boom in the AI markets. Mr. Liang cannot have his salary or other cash  comp adjusted until June 30th, 2026.

One of the KPI's was based around none other than share price appreciation. The package was awarded and set at a share price of $34.08 and the goals were broken into five tranches with the highest being $120 a share and all this needed to be hit by September 30th, 2026. This would have been a CAGR of 25% over ~5.5 years but lucky for SMCI shareholders this was achieved in ~2.2 years for a 75% CAGR. 

In November 2023 the compensation package was adjusted with the approval of the **2023 CEO Compensation Package** where SMCI was again lucky enough to achieve almost all goals on share price appreciation on these new tranches too. 

Their CFO had no KPI's around the company's health. Nothing regarding leverage ratios, operating income, cash flow generation, but three KPI's that were 1) share price appreciation (2X weighted), long-term investor increase (2X weighted), and an individual performance measured by Mr. Liang. The CFO being rewarded heavily on share price appreciation and attractive investing should be a red flag. And while the CFO achieved these goals in such a short time, he has now been rewarded with losing his job. One must ask why?

Another target is around revenue growth and while any company should be focused on revenue, the above KPI's highlight a culture that is focused on driving share price appreciation before all else. There is an active whistleblower lawsuit stating SMCI improperly recognized revenue and just today that same whistleblower doubled down on such claims. 

December 5th, 2023 SMCI made a public offering of 2,415,805 shares, then they went and issued convertible notes in February 2024, then on March 22nd, 2024 they went and issued another round of equity for 2,000,000 shares. All of this equity at a time when executives are rewarded for share price gains.

The Ablecom/Compuware relationship has been called out and I think it should have more attention. There is a lot of PO movement between these companies that are all owned by relatives. These two companies also handle design work, tool builds, and various other things; do we know where all the debt lies and perhaps CAPEX is understated as it's absorbed elsewhere? Impossible to say either way given we can't get public financials for these other organizations. No comment from SMCI leaves investors left to speculate. 

Now we get to the recent news of EY resigning. I have seen some estimates that EY was walking from multiple million dollar deal in being the auditor for SMCI, what did they see? Given the trouble EY has had over the past few years with a failed split and SEC fines, walking away from a potential AI darling account seems very difficult to understand. In the 8-K statement filed by SMCI, EY was quoted as ***""we are resigning due to information that has recently come to our attention which has led us to no longer be able to rely on management's and the Audit Committee’s representations and to be unwilling to be associated with the financial statements prepared by management, and after concluding we can no longer provide the Audit Services in accordance with applicable law or professional obligations.”***, which is no light statement. Yet, an internal investigation by SMCI finds nothing that aligned with what EY found? No discrepancy at all? This investigation by SMCI was led by someone who is now a board member, but of course Mr. Market rallies on the news of ""no fault"" but the pieces do not fit.

The recent cancellations of two bank facilities should also raise red flags. It is clear if you read the terms that SMCI was in violation of debt covenants and would have been in default, but these terminations now constrict liquidity. SMCI has stated they will possibly need these lending facilities to fund inventory as they see growth, but because of these filings delays and auditor resignations they cancelled them. I am not seeing many talk about the future growth constraints from this move. It also highlights there may be more here because why not work with the banks? Unless of course you have no intention of filing your 10-K/Q anytime soon or there is true risks on what BDO finds. 

While the above may indeed be nothing, I am having a hard time reading the recent events as bullish. While a self audit is good show and will likely prevent a delisting, the delayed 10-K/Q gives investors no insight into where the company stands. It is possible BDO will begin their audit and find gaps the same as EY. The equity offerings at a time when executives are rewarded for share price appreciation also is a red flag from an investor POV as your dilution is funding direct reward. The MOAT for SMCI is not as strong as many state and the margins are not either. 

While this may be value in many investors eyes, there is some big risks here that I see ignored because stoinks only go up.

37,SMCI,SMCI - Position Management of Butterfly Trade,"Hello traders, noobie in options here. I bought 15 SMCI butterfly contracts ($33L, $41S, $49L) with Feb 21 expiry around a month ago when SMCI was trading in the mid-20s for $0.95 a piece.

SMCI closed at $42 yesterday, close to my max. return of $8 per contract at the $41 middle strike. Problem is there is still close to 3 months left and the IV/theta on the short portion of the trade are still quite high and offsetting any real potential gains (position is only at $1.20 per contract currently).

So my question here is, what position management alternatives could I use to reduce the risk of the butterfly expiring out of the money? Open to any suggestions, thanks!

11,SMCI,Super Micro Computer pops 15% after special committee finds no ‘evidence of misconduct’,"Super Micro Computer surged more than 14% after a special committee ruled that it found “no evidence of misconduct” at the embattled AI server maker, and appointed a new chief accounting officer.

“The evidence reviewed by the Special Committee did not raise any substantial concerns about the integrity of Supermicro’s senior management or Audit Committee, or their commitment to ensuring that the Company’s financial statements are materially accurate,” the company said in a release.

Super Micro said it’s also currently searching for a new chief financial officer, and looking to fill additional financial leadership positions. The company appointed current Vice President of Finance and Corporate Controller Kenneth Cheung as its chief accounting officer.

The news from Super Micro Computer comes on the heels of a volatile year for the company. Shares sank in August after Hindenburg Research revealed a short position in the company, saying that it found “fresh evidence of accounting manipulation” and the company delayed the release of its annual filing.

Those troubles continued, with Ernst &amp; Young resigning as the company’s auditor in October due to concerns about the board’s governance and independence. Shares are up about 30% this year, after giving back much of its rally. Last month, the company averted a potential delisting from the Nasdaq following its monster plunge.

Among the findings, the committee ruled that the conclusions reached by Ernst &amp; Young in its resignation were “not supported by the facts” and that the firm’s audit committee exhibited “appropriate independence and generally provided proper oversight.”

The special committee consisted of Super Micro’s board, counsel from Cooley LLP and a team from forensic accounting firm Secretariat Advisors.

Made a bad call back in March holding onto what seemed like a pretty safe call debit spread on SMCI (actually posted about it back then too lmao 😬). Long story short SMCI closed right at the short leg strike point, so whoever was holding onto the 10 contracts I was short on decided not to exercise, leaving me long on 1000 very pricey and very volatile shares of SMCI. Ended up getting margin called that weekend and losing almost 11k when markets opened that Monday 🙃

Proceeded to make a series of bad panic option trades on NVDA and Adobe over the following months trying to recoup my losses, dropping me further into the red. Was down about 18k at the beginning of September

Finally had a stroke of luck with a well played call spread on MSI (posted about that too), then rode the election wave up to the green over the past few weeks. Special thanks to RDDT and TSLA 🙏

125,SMCI,Why I am bullish on SMCI. #Calls ,"SMCI has been on a roller coaster this year but personally I think this one is set to be one of the greatest comebacks we have witnessed in a while.

Reasons why I am bullish on SMCI.

1. The company has launched next-generation products utilizing NVIDIA's Blackwell GPUs and CPUs, which are expected to drive demand from AI and cloud service providers. Early testing has been promising, and production is ramping up
2. SMCI remains a key supplier for AI servers and infrastructure, benefiting from the explosive growth of AI and data center investments by major companies like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon. Its servers, including liquid-cooled models, are crucial for high-efficiency AI applications
3. Despite recent challenges (which many other companies have went through may I add), SMCI's underlying business remains solid. Demand for its products is robust, driven by the need for scalable, energy-efficient server solutions in AI and cloud applications. SMCI has made significant progress toward regulatory compliance, including hiring BDO USA as its auditor and submitted a plan to Nasdaq to avoid delisting.
4. Recent insider purchases totaling 1.51 million shares indicate confidence in the company’s future prospects. Insider buying is often viewed as a positive signal regarding management's belief in the company’s growth potential and frankly my belief as well.
5. The company’s partnership with leading firms in AI and cloud services ensures a steady demand pipeline. Expanding client adoption of its innovative server solutions further strengthens its market position.

Personally I am extremely bullish. 1.51M shares bought is absolutely mind blowing they must know something retail doesn't and the stock is trading at a huge discount right now.

Calls it is.

I know there’s some chatter about potential accounting issues.

129,SMCI,I think my friend sold me my calls on $SMCI,"I swear on my mother’s eyes. I’m sitting there like a fing genius looking at my hood gambling account, staring at the SMCI chart and reading all this bullshit regards are spewing on twitter about the stock getting delisted. Luckly, I just came out of a similar trade on B.Riley and kinda figured if those frauds can get away with not filing financials on time for over 180 days and they are still trading, there is no way SMCI will get delisted.

I buy 250 $34.5 strike weekly calls on SMCI at $0.50 a pop. That’s a \~$12,500, baby position babbyyy. Why $34.5 calls? idk whats funnier than $34? $34.5. Also I looked at where it dropped when EY announced they wouldn't proceed as their auditors amd $34.5 is about the level they closed at that day. Finally, $34.5 is within my personal risk tolerance. guh

Today, I’m minding my own business, scrolling Reddit, eating a sandwich, watching Ana De Armas AI Porn, minding my own business. My phone buzzes, and it’s my buddy. This guy texts me out of nowhere, “Man, I think I’m fucked. I sold $34.5 naked calls on SMCI this week. Thought it’d be easy money.”

So I’m like, waiiiiiiiiiiiiiit.. I check my broker app and look at the open interest on these contracts, and my jaw hits the goddamn floor. The open interest is 257. lol. **257 contracts**, and your boy here owns **250** of them. I’m the goddamn other side of his trade! I'm the guy that said yuuuuuuuuuup I'll take those off your hands sir. 

If everything holds up and SMCI opens strong tomorrow, this guy is about to be bent over a financial barrel, down 500% at open (das what the app is saying rn at least). He thought he was playing it safe, slinging naked calls like he’s DFV or something, and now he’s unknowingly writing me a fat f\*\*\*ing check for $62,000 (so far).

He knows I bought SMCI calls. I mentioned it in passing, like, “Yeah, I’m in on SMCI this week.” But he doesn’t know **how many** or **what strike**. I didn’t tell him I went full-blown degenerate with $12.5K on a strike so far out of the money.

Now I’m sitting here, “Do I tell him?” Like, “Hey bro, funny story, you’re about to owe me your next three paychecks because I’m holding all the cards—and by cards, I mean your fuckiing calls.” Or do I keep my mouth shut and let the market gods do what they do? I feel bad, but not that bad, you know? Trading is a tough game isn't it? No mercy.

So that’s where I'm going to hold a little past open and then I’m cashing in big-time, and he’s gonna be selling plasma to cover his losses. What would you guys do? Do I come clean, or let him find out the hard way? Either way, I’m buying a steak dinner tomorrow. Maybe I’ll even let him smell it.

12,SMCI,Super Micro hires new auditor to maintain Nasdaq listing; shares pop 23%,"Embattled server maker Super Micro Computer said on Monday that it’s hired BDO as its new auditor and submitted a plan to Nasdaq detailing its efforts to regain compliance with the exchange. The shares jumped 23% in extended trading.

“This is an important next step to bring our financial statements current, an effort we are pursuing with both diligence and urgency,” Super Micro CEO Charles Liang said in a statement.

Super Micro is late in filing its 2024 year-end report with the SEC, and said earlier this month that it was looking for a new accountant after its previous auditor, Ernst &amp; Young, stepped down in October. Ernst &amp; Young was new to the job, having just replaced Deloitte &amp; Touche as Super Micro’s accounting firm in March 2023.

Super Micro said it told Nasdaq that it believes it will be able to file its annual report for the year ended June 30, and quarterly report for the period ended Sept. 30. The company said it will remain listed on the Nasdaq pending the exchange’s “review of the compliance plan.”

Shares of Super Micro soared more than twentyfold over a two year period from early 2022 until their peak in March of this year. But the stock has been hammered on troubling news about its compliance with Nasdaq. Once valued at about $70 billion, the company’s market cap was at $12.6 billion at the close on Monday, following a 16% rally during regular trading.

Super Micro has been one of the primary beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence boom, due to its relationship with Nvidia. Sales last fiscal year more than doubled to $15 billion.

On Monday, Super Micro announced that it was selling products featuring Nvidia’s next-generation AI chip called Blackwell. The company competes with vendors like Dell and Hewlett Packard Enterprise in packaging up Nvidia AI chips for other companies to access.

Super Micro was added to the S&amp;P 500 in March, reflecting its rapidly growing business and then-soaring stock price. Less than two weeks after the index changes were announced, Super Micro reached its closing high of $118.81.

The troubles began within months. In August, Super Micro said it wouldn’t file its annual report with the SEC on time. Noted short seller Hindenburg Research then disclosed a short position in the company, and said in a report that it identified “fresh evidence of accounting manipulation.” The Wall Street Journal later reported that the Department of Justice was at the early stages of a probe into the company.

The month after announcing its report delay, Super Micro said it had received a notification from the Nasdaq, indicating that the delay in the filing of its annual report meant the company wasn’t in compliance with the exchange’s listing rules. Super Micro said the Nasdaq’s rules allowed the company 60 days to file its report or submit a plan to regain compliance. Based on that timeframe, the deadline was Monday.

59,SMCI,Supermicro - hold or sell - my strategy,"Disclosure of related position: I bought Supermicro for my growth and momentum trading strategy back in January 2022 for $43.20 (split aligned $4.32) and then doubled down the 6th of September 2022 for $64.22 (split aligned $6.422). Then I partially sold 15th May 2023 at 137.19 (split aligned 13.719), 10th of January 2024 at  $355 (split aligned $35.5) and 12th of September 2024 at $442.13 (split aligned $44.231).

I took out already much more than I did put in, but still own a large position of SMCI. Now I'm in the process of changing the rule for a complete selling in my strategy. As you can see in my disclosure I left a lot of money on the table which already made me change the way I take partial gains.

But let's speak about Supermicro here. What happened:

Hindenburg took a short position and published a report about bookkeeping fraud at Supermicro. Then the auditor, Ernst &amp; Young, resigned. The company is now behind on the mandatory reports to the SEC two quarters. This weekend is the deadline for a de-listing on the NASDAQ. The stock tanked 82% from the high. According to the actual published numbers (which may be corrected) the stock is now almost as cheap as when I bought it first, even if the value more than quadrupled still after the loss of 82%.

Now, Hindenburg at first only cited ex employees as source. But the resignation of Ernst &amp; Young as auditor was probably an ace in Hindenburgs sleeve. I personally know Ernst &amp; Young, they are not exactly my favorites. Since they published the report there was a mass of bad news published, the exact same analysts that hived Supermicro to the SP500 more or less exactly at the high say now it is junk after that loss.

I was thinking about Apple. In the time it would have been most profitable to buy everybody shouted sell. The stock lost more than once 80% of its market value.

Supermicro owns a lot of very unique patents. Their liquid cooled systems take less time to build and are more modular than any of the other competitors systems, Dell being its main competitor. Even if they reported some orders too early as sale they sell a lot lot more than a few years ago thanks to AI. And they will probably sell a lot more.

I think it is very possible that we cannot trade Supermicro on the Nasdaq next week. An that means it will fall out of the SP500 and the NASDAQ 100, putting a lot of sell pressure on the ETF that mirror those indices. Or, Supermicro presents a new auditor and a plan to deliver the reports to the SEC by this weekend.

It is probably a binary bet that will be resolved soon. In my opinion the upside (probability to win multiplied with amount to win) is much higher than the downside (probability to lose multiplied with amount to lose). And even if it is delisted, it is far away from being worthless. Probably it will be a target for Dell.

136,SMCI,I (only) lost $32k shorting TSLA this month ,"Hello fellow degens, some of you may remember my earlier post about making $70k shorting TSLA this year (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1g9hus6/70k_profit_from_shorting_tsla/). 

As you can guess this strategy has not worked well this month and my YTD profit from my favorite EV company is now down to $40k (see second pic)

But please indulge my big brain boast about not completely fucking it up because in an alternate universe, I would have completely wiped my portfolio. Instead, I had the audacity to do something unheard of in this sub: RisK MiTigAtiOn.

Basically at the height of my profits I transferred most of my money out of my margin trading account and into another cash trading account (and into basic bitch ETFs). This saved my ass because I would definitely would have gone full regard and shorted TSLA with a position 3x larger than what I actually did = 3x larger loss.

So for you fellow degens who have mooned recently, congrats, fuck you, and consider implementing measures to curb your degeneracy. Lock your gains into ETFs, change your account from margin to cash, or transfer your assets to your wife or to her boyfriend since it’ll eventually go to him anyway.

In any case, see you at Wendy’s.

13,SMCI,Super Micro Computer- SMCI $26 - Avoid Till We Get Restated Financials,"**I think Super Micro Computer, (SMCI) should be avoided for the following reasons:**

**Restatements could alter the financials significantly:** The odds are high that the company will end up restating past financials. The Auditor’s resignation, its CEO’s pay package, and its past settlement with the SEC in 2018 all suggest that SMCI will have to restate its financial statements.

**No 10K:** SMCI has delayed its annual 10-K filing and without an audited 10K, we have precious little faith in the numbers. 

**SMCI has priors:** This was not their first time. In 2018, the company settled charges with the [SEC for improper accounting](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2020-190). As stated in the article from the SEC website….

&gt;

**Tainted:** To me the alleged malfeasance creates significant doubts for investors that will not go away for a while, and it's very likely that Wall Street will not touch it, fearing liability for not doing enough due diligence. Also, I can’t imagine SMCI getting a decent multiple in the future for the same reasons until faith is restored in management and its books.

**Possible Loan Default:**  There is a significant risk of Super Micro defaulting on the company's Term Loan Agreement with Bank of America. 

**Compensation tied to aggressive revenue targets**: The CEO’s unusual compensation package, with virtually no base salary and bonuses tied to very aggressive revenue and share price targets, is a dangerous and potentially abusive practice.

**Possible delisting from the Nasdaq, and getting thrown out of the S&amp;P 500**: The chances of both are high as a new auditor needs to be found, and a substantial amount of restatement work needs to be done.

**A great business:** Sure, SMCI has a great server liquid cooling business, which has tremendous potential and demand for server racks for AI GPUs, right now and for the foreseeable future. However, as we saw Nvidia has already started shifting this business.

**Ignore the low valuation:** I’m going to ignore the current low valuation of 8x earnings and 0.5x sales, which are much lower than competitors such as Dell (DELL) and Oracle (ORCL), simply because I have no idea what the restated financials will look like, and the valuation could be a lot different

The only way I would invest is the possibility of a merger/acquisition/White Knight, that will keep the stock afloat. The CEO owns close to 10% of the company so I doubt if he would let this go without a fight.

The other problem I foresee is the difficulty of getting good and timely information. For the most part, we rely on analysts who expect a proper set of books. Instead of focusing on the fundamentals, we’ll be spending far too much time, and worse without success trying to figure out what is genuine or not, It would make better sense to invest in other GPU/semiconductor businesses.

While that is a huge red flag, you cant ignore the massive influence it has in the market and how essential it is in the industry. The net sales almost doubled in 2024 and are expected to double again for 2025. See stats below:

I would argue that if the issues came from their core products as in defects, it would have a huge impact on them long-term. I'm positive that there are large investors or firms lining up to take the business with so much upside, all it takes is the right person to make the needle move. While cooking the books is not good news, it is a small bump in the road for the company with long term potential and solid performance, specially with AI capabilities growing in the near future.

148,SMCI,SMCI Bull Thesis,"I have taken a deep dive to truly understand the bull thesis on this stock. Let’s consider what the positives are at the moment:

1. **The fall from the March high of $1200**. Before the split that would be a drop from \~$1200 to $250 roughly a 80% loss in value. Bull Thesis…well after the split the numbers don’t look as bad. 1200 to 250 seems huge when compared to 120 to 25. So the drop now was only $95 vs $950. Psychologically better for a bull thesis when you look at this way…less room to climb!
2. **SMCI has made a complete u-turn to where it traded this time last year:** $1200 back to $250. Bull Thesis: history may repeat itself and you can do this all over again and not make the mistakes you did last time. 
3. **Low cost of entry.** Bull Thesis: If you wait a little bit to buy you may be able to get it at $10.
4. **Hindenburg Report**: Since the report came out two months ago the stock has sold off dramatically. Bull thesis: These claims have not been proven or even discussed by Charles Lang! His silence can only mean these are not true and not worth his time to discuss with shareholders. It is honorable of him to take our time into consideration and not force us to read a statement or watch a video explanation regarding the report. 
5. **10k has yet to be filed**. Bull Thesis: No one knows what the status is... so as far as we know it is a fantastic report. 
6. **DOJ probe**: Bull Thesis: Everyone knows that the DOJ probes almost every tech stock. There hasn't been much word about this lately, so it probably means the government just forgot about it and it is time to buy calls.
7. **EY resigning:** this one is simple. Bull Thesis: The EY resignation means Charles can save money and hire his cousins or other family member’s accounting firm for half the price.
8. **SEC delisting:** Well this one depends on the accounting firm. Bull Thesis: If Charles indeed does have a family member do the audit then the numbers will be golden, delisting averted and it is time to buy calls. 
9. **SP500:** If SMCI is kicked out of the SP500 then it is just 4 more quarters of growth to get back in and the stock will hit $120 again!

So in closing: Sure there are at least 9 items here that are a black cloud hanging  over SMCI. Sure other stocks don’t have these issues and are rallying to all time highs in the most bullish part of the year. Sure, you could sell and put your money in any of these others stocks and not have all these risks. But I see now if I just opened my mind and changed the way I think about SMCI there is a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. This whole time I should have done what most of the sub was doing…buy at ATH’s and DCA! I wasted almost a whole year not dollar cost averaging and now the stock is 80% below the March highs. I missed out on all that. ",0,52,1730517025.0,2024-11-02T03:10:25+00:00,t3_1ghnclj,wallstreetbets,"SMCI Bull Thesis I have taken a deep dive to truly understand the bull thesis on this stock.

7. **EY resigning:** this one is simple. Bull Thesis: The EY resignation means Charles can save money and hire his cousins or other family member’s accounting firm for half the price.
8. **SEC delisting:** Well this one depends on the accounting firm. Bull Thesis: If Charles indeed does have a family member do the audit then the numbers will be golden, delisting averted and it is time to buy calls. 
9. **SP500:** If SMCI is kicked out of the SP500 then it is just 4 more quarters of growth to get back in and the stock will hit $120 again!

So in closing: Sure there are at least 9 items here that are a black cloud hanging  over SMCI. Sure other stocks don’t have these issues and are rallying to all time highs in the most bullish part of the year. Sure, you could sell and put your money in any of these others stocks and not have all these risks. But I see now if I just opened my mind and changed the way I think about SMCI there is a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. This whole time I should have done what most of the sub was doing…buy at ATH’s and DCA! I wasted almost a whole year not dollar cost averaging and now the stock is 80% below the March highs. I missed out on all that. ",0.025697855278849602,0.7813645005226135,0.19293765723705292,negative,0.7813645005226135,-0.7556666452437639

43,SMCI,Managing a SMCI fiasco calendar spread,"Might not be a 100% thetagang play, but 50% at minimum it is. 



I need a second, third, fourth etc opinion on how to best handle a currently profitable trade I've opened right after trading hours started.

  
For a bit of context, you know SMCI - Super Micro Computers, guys who build server racks and assemble servers. Hinderburg did a research on them about a month and a half ago and stockprice plummeted. Long story short, shady family business affairs, rehiring of execs who were previously fired in a book-cooking scandal that led to delisting, and of course, cooking the books and exxagerating revenue statements again. They also delayed quarterly earnings and it was a big fiasco around it. Anyway, the stock volatility calmed after some time, and everybody is waiting for them to publish the delayed quarterly results somewhere between 1-5 November.

  
Today in the pre-market, less than a week before earnings, it was reported that their accountants, Ernst &amp; Young (EY) resigned. Really big red flag; stock went -30% in the last half an hour preceding market opening.

  
Now, getting to my play: I've noticed that options expiring on 1st Nov were (ofcourse) very expensive, while options expiring on 8th of Nov, 2-3 days after earning, were cheap. So at a stock price of roughly 33 USD, I did the following:

(NOTE that I use + for money that flows into my account and - for ourflows)



\- SELL 1ST NOV 32.5 PUT @ -2.96 USD

\- BUY 8TH NOV 32.5 PUT @ 3.83 USD

\- SELL 1ST NOV 33 CALL @ -2.74 USD

\- BUY 8TH NOV 33 CALL @ 3.68 USD

  
Overall, did the play for a debit of 1.8 USD. Now, its the first time doing different exp trades and at some point I got lost in how to calculate P&amp;L - got a bit confused about IBKR ?clunky? max profit/ max loss calculations and somehow kept in mind from that that the max loss is the credit paid = 1.8 USD.  Anyway, managed to get my thoughts in order and I'm back on track with the P&amp;L, and how should I expect it to work.

  
After buying the options, stock price went up to around 35-36 USD and the short put lost consistent value, so I managed to buy it back after 2 hours for 0.88 USD, basically pocketing 70% of the premium on it. After the 36 USD high, price went back to 32-33, and for the rest of the day I hunted and opportunity to do the same with the short call (which I lost only about 1 USD of value till market close). So now, this what I'm holding:

\- 8th Nov long 32.5 PUT: current value 3.48 vs 3.83 at purchase (-0.35USD own gain)

\- 8th Nov long 33 CALL: current value 3.7 vs 3.68 at purchase (+0.02 USD own gain)

\- 1st Nov short 33 CALL: current value 1.75 vs 2.74 at purchase (+0.99 USD own gain)

\- + 2.08 USD as proceedings from the closed short put.

Bottomline,  +2.74 USD floating P&amp;L for an initial expenditure of 1.8 USD.

  
Profit is juicy, however I'm thinking of the best way to further profit on this position. My current thought is to wait for another dollar or so to wear off from the short call, pocket another 2 USD worth of time decay, and keep the 32.5/33 strange for the earnings, an equivalent of buying the strangle for 3.2 USD.

  
1)Regarding the short call: at current close price, it holds around 5 cents of intrinsec value, against a contract price of 1.75. I would expect the price to fall sharply over the course of the next trading day, if SMCI price does not rebound. However, if the prices rebound or the contract is slightly in the money at expiration, what would be the best way to handle it? purchase 100 shares right before close for the assignment? I am asking this  since from a previous experience, ATM contracts do not trade as low as they should near expiration. Had a Cameco call 1.5 USD OTM trading at 70-80 cents with 5 minutes left to expiration. So my question is, what would be the best way to either juice or reduce the friction for the ATM/ITM short call, given that I would rather keep the 8 Nov long call?

  
2)Regarding the long contracts: call slightly ITM, put slightly OTM. So basically 7 USD of time value, in a period when the time decay is at its steepest rate. I am reconsidering if holding the contracts for earnings is the best decision. I believe SMCI is kinda cooked given that EY resigned, probably the allegations Hindenburg made against them are at least partly true, if not fully. Reasonably, with another 1 USD juiced from the short call and considering that all the current proceeding were funneled into the strangle, I'd be sitting flat with a strangle purchased at roughly 3.2 USD. This would require a move of +/- 3.2 USD to breakeven at expiration, or \~5.9 USD to be at the current (2.7 USD) profit level. As mentioned, I believe SMCI will probably see some pretty wild fluctuations, but it would still require a roughly 20% move to be at the same profit level as now. How probable is this move? I don't know. Will there be an IV crush after earnings? Perhaps. What would you do?

  
Any second opinion is appreciated. Also please let me know if you spot any flaw in my logic or in my calculations; first time with calendar spreads.",1,5,1730325119.0,2024-10-30T21:51:59+00:00,t3_1gfydjf,thetagang,"Managing a SMCI fiasco calendar spread Might not be a 100% thetagang play, but 50% at minimum it is. 



I need a second, third, fourth etc opinion on how to best handle a currently profitable trade I've opened right after trading hours started.

  
For a bit of context, you know SMCI - Super Micro Computers, guys who build server racks and assemble servers. Hinderburg did a research on them about a month and a half ago and stockprice plummeted. Long story short, shady family business affairs, rehiring of execs who were previously fired in a book-cooking scandal that led to delisting, and of course, cooking the books and exxagerating revenue statements again. They also delayed quarterly earnings and it was a big fiasco around it. Anyway, the stock volatility calmed after some time, and everybody is waiting for them to publish the delayed quarterly results somewhere between 1-5 November.

  
Today in the pre-market, less than a week before earnings, it was reported that their accountants, Ernst &amp; Young (EY) resigned. Really big red flag; stock went -30% in the last half an hour preceding market opening.

  
Now, getting to my play: I've noticed that options expiring on 1st Nov were (ofcourse) very expensive, while options expiring on 8th of Nov, 2-3 days after earning, were cheap. So at a stock price of roughly 33 USD, I did the following:

(NOTE that I use + for money that flows into my account and - for ourflows)



\- SELL 1ST NOV 32.5 PUT @ -2.96 USD

\- BUY 8TH NOV 32.5 PUT @ 3.83 USD

\- SELL 1ST NOV 33 CALL @ -2.74 USD

\- BUY 8TH NOV 33 CALL @ 3.68 USD

  
Overall, did the play for a debit of 1.8 USD. Now, its the first time doing different exp trades and at some point I got lost in how to calculate P&amp;L - got a bit confused about IBKR ?clunky? max profit/ max loss calculations and somehow kept in mind from that that the max loss is the credit paid = 1.8 USD.  Anyway, managed to get my thoughts in order and I'm back on track with the P&amp;L, and how should I expect it to work.

  
After buying the options, stock price went up to around 35-36 USD and the short put lost consistent value, so I managed to buy it back after 2 hours for 0.88 USD, basically pocketing 70% of the premium on it. After the 36 USD high, price went back to 32-33, and for the rest of the day I hunted and opportunity to do the same with the short call (which I lost only about 1 USD of value till market close). So now, this what I'm holding:

\- 8th Nov long 32.5 PUT: current value 3.48 vs 3.83 at purchase (-0.35USD own gain)

\- 8th Nov long 33 CALL: current value 3.7 vs 3.68 at purchase (+0.02 USD own gain)

\- 1st Nov short 33 CALL: current value 1.75 vs 2.74 at purchase (+0.99 USD own gain)

\- + 2.08 USD as proceedings from the closed short put.

Bottomline,  +2.74 USD floating P&amp;L for an initial expenditure of 1.8 USD.

61,SMCI,Why SMCI's situation is a massive threat to Nvidia,"SMCI has faced allegations of accounting manipulation, which have escalated this morning when it was revealed that their auditor, Ernst &amp; Young, resigned. The true extent of the situation is not yet known to the public

SMCI is one of Nvidia's largest customers, accounting for 9% of their sales. If they go under, Nvidia will take a massive hit to their future earnings.

Some may argue that it does not matter, because since Nvidia's production is sold out, any gap in orders would be filled by other customers. There are 2 problems with this assumption:

1. This ignores the impact of a hypothetical liquidation of SMCI. If SMCI was faking orders, this would mean that they likely have a growing inventory of AI chips. These would then be auctioned off, creating a surge in supply, competing with new orders.

2. The duration of Nvidia's lead times can impact their margins and pricing power. If you have a 12 month lead time due to immense demand, you can hike prices. If that lead time shrinks to 1 month due to losing a significant customer, you have less margin to raise prices without impacting sales.

This scandal could also draw attention to other ""round tripping"" arrangements in the tech industry, in which circular transactions are set up in order to fake revenue growth. This could very much be the start of the unraveling of a bubble.

This isn't going to bankrupt Nvidia, they still have incredibly successful products and other customers, but it could definitely lead to a case where earnings growth stagnates, or is not sufficient enough to justify their current share price.

Despite this tremendous threat, Nvidia is down just 1% today, which is well within its normal volatility.

161,SMCI,"""Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) is an unstoppable stock that could make you richer""","From an article yesterday on Yahoo Finance courtesy of Insider Monkey, the day before Ernst &amp; Young resigns as their accountant and the stock drops by 1/3. The stock market lottery has a surprise around every corner. Long, short, whatever you want, there's a chance. If this convinced you to get back in yesterday, what a surprise was in store today.  


Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) is an unstoppable stock that could make you richer as it is developing high-performance server and storage solutions that are in high demand amid the artificial intelligence race and digital revolution. It is turning out to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom as it makes computers that companies use as servers for data storage.

At the start of 2024, Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) held just 6% of the worldwide server market. Selling liquid-cooled, high-performance servers for demanding computing tasks has allowed it to carve out a niche for itself. Because of this, Nvidia found Supermicro to be a perfect partner and provided it with top-tier data center GPUs to aid in producing dedicated AI servers.

Though not exclusive, its strategic partnership with Nvidia has strengthened its competitive edge in the server market. Super Micro’s revenue more than quadrupled from $3.6 billion in fiscal 2021 to $14.9 billion in fiscal 2024, coinciding with the generative AI market’s explosive growth. Additionally, its earnings per share (EPS) increased by almost ten times. More than half of its revenue now comes from AI servers.

The confirmation that Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) is shipping more than 100,000 graphics processing units used for artificial intelligence underlines the strong demand that could translate into billions of dollars in revenues. Like other cloud service providers, Super Micro claimed to have recently installed over 100,000 GPUs with liquid cooling for some of the largest AI factories ever built.

The soaring GPU orders are one of the reasons analysts remain bullish about Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI), with an average price target of $64.22, implying a 33.40% upside potential as of October 25, 2024. As per Insider Monkey’s Q2 2024 database, the company was in the portfolios of 47 hedge funds.

163,SMCI,MSFT Pre-Earnings Analysis: AI Arms Race and Channel Check - AI Number May Show Double Digit Growth in Q1 2025 - Monster Quarter Growth,"This might be one of Microsoft's most influential quarters in quite some time. The main argument for my thesis is OpenAI and recent AI model upgrades from in the form of GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-o1, and GPT-o1-mini. As well, I don't know if anyone noticed their Uranium portfolio's going through the roof but if not check out SMR, OKLO and others to see more. AI needs so much power that they are opening up defunct nuclear power plants on 3-mile island in Pennsylvania for new energy sources.

What most media types don't have a window into, mostly I assume this because they keep saying the same silly thing over and over again, is that enterprise is using AI. AI is not going to come in the form of a ""killer app"". The killer app is ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Mistral. Those are the killer apps but those are also not important things in the AI arms race. AI in and of in itself is the killer app. The reason for this is that it commoditized intelligence in the form of tokens that can be literally bought and sold through the cloud.

When certain media types keep railing on the notion that ""who's making money with this"" they are missing the reality in that people are making money with this each and every day. The enterprise is creating applications that are simply not understood by everyday people or analysts because there not the ""killer apps"" that people think of which represents mostly something popular that teenagers and young adults are into. Is Venmo a killer app? Is Facebook a killer apps still? I don't know maybe I'm just not with the times. What i do know is that is that AI is so large and so democratized that the use cases, while not killer, are becoming increasingly ubiquitous in the enterprise setting.

This is the fast and steady drum beat of GAI increasingly taking over all human cognitive tasks.  It won't happen overnight but it is happening. I think what is happening with the media is that they can't put a metric to it so I will attempt to.

AI adoption and penetration into everyday processes and tasks for enterprise is probably at 0.6%-1%. If you include the backlog of potential AI penetration it is probably 2 - 5% of all enterprise tasks and processes. The immediate 1 - 2 year outlook of AI penetration is probably 1 - 3% with a backlog of 6-9%. To be clear, I am not considering productivity gains because who the hell cares about any of that.  I am specifically speaking about cold hard ROI of implementing an AI automation system and having that AI do the work that was once a human task now offloading to an AI automation task.

I don't know how you feel about the above numbers but in my interpretation it is incredibly slow but growth can be incredibly exponential in relatively a short amount of time. The reason, I've written about this many times before, is because the data is not ready, the talent is not there to reconstruct and rebuild what needs to be in place to make efficient data process that are specific to AI, and many many other factors.

This is why consulting through the likes of Accenture, Palantir, IBM and others will be very important in the coming years. It's my opinion that companies now matter how large or small won't be able to put in the right processes without proven practices that will foster from consultancy groups rather than at home grown talent. However, there will be clues of how well the progress is going. An AI channel check if you will.

**AI Channel Check through Microsoft Azure:**

Microsoft provides this channel check for us. Alphabet just completed their channel check and the news on AI was good. Continued spending for all things AI and healthy numbers in their core businesses to justify the continued spend. I look for Microsoft to report much in the same way in terms of AI CapEx/Spend.

2 quarters ago Microsoft started reporting the AI portion of their Azure Cloud revenues. 2 quarters ago it was 6%, and the previous quarter it rose to 7%. For their earnings report tomorrow the AI revenue should be in the 10-12% range. In my opinion 8% is not going to cut it. 1% quarterly gain seems slow. The number in aggregate should be 2%+ quarter to quarter growth. In this way, 1% isn't going to cut it for Wall Street. Perhaps we do see 8%-9% next quarter and that wouldn't be a horrible thing but if Microsoft wants to blow the doors off of earnings and reestablish a healthy growth pattern it is of my opinion that number of percent AI revenue shares needs a meaningful bps up.

I believe that in this earnings there will be that meaningful click upwards of AI percentage growth for Microsoft in the 10%+ range. 11% would be a bust out surprise and 12% would be significantly positive. So where is this possible 3% rise in AI revenue growth coming from? Look no further than GPT-4o.

**GPT-4o and the AI Number**

Gpt-4o was initially released on May 13, 2024. For reference, Microsoft's last quarter was, Q4 2024, ended on June 30, 2024, with earnings reported on July 30, 2024. **AI number 7%**. There was no way for GPT-4o to significantly penetrate into their earnings with only roughly 30 days of usage. If you take into account the iterations of 4o itself the model initially was met with skepticism (compared to GPT-4-Turbo) and apprehension until subsequent versions of 4o were released. All-in-all, there is no way GPT-4o was going to be in the previous quarters (Q4) earnings report.

However, what's even more interesting is the increase in quota and throughput of GPT-4 to GPT-4o. This is where I believe the AI number from Microsoft will materially increase. Let's take a look.

First, let's start with **GPT-4-Turbo** which was released November 6, 2023.

Using this as a ground truth you can see that the token limit is 134k per minute with a max of 2.7 K requests per minute. this and surely prior to this was hell on enterprises to do any meaningful work with the models. It was great for experimenting and getting started but not for meaningful production work.

**GPT-4o** was released on May 13, 2024.

**Git Commit** [431bb24](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-ai-docs/blob/431bb24aadae464afbeb46a522cf613dc9418025/articles/ai-services/openai/quotas-limits.md):

Commit **431bb24** was dated to May 20, 2024. As you can see from previous GPT-4 capacity limitations GPT-4o introduced a massive improvement for quota limit TPM and requests per minute RPM. This is a significant release for enterprise customers as they can now begin to plan, develop, and execute AI software stacks into production environments. 60 K RPM's is a 22X upgrade towards production throughput.

Commit **30084ae** was dated July 24, 2024. In this update the quota TPM was raised from 10M to 30M tokens per minute.

[**Current Quota Limits**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/quotas-limits):

https://preview.redd.it/l2ah831essxd1.png?width=1153&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f59ee5eb421e81d5eb40afb16147f11b3b0c293

In the current quota limits there is a 180 K RPM increase from 60 K. At this point and earlier in the quarter OpenAI's GPT-4o models became capacity unlocked. There is nothing you cannot do or plan for in terms of AI model integrations, TPM's, or RPM throughput. At this moment, intelligence is untethered from any api constraints. What you can imagine building in terms of AI and LLMs and the delivery of those products and services can be fully realized without constraint.

If you go from the beginning analysis of GPT-4-Turbo until today there is a **223X tokens per minute (TPM) increase and a 66.66X request per minute (RPM) increase.**

This is a massive throughput gain that cannot be expressed enough of how significant this is in terms of AI advancements regarding enterprise adoption.

This is why I believe the AI Number finally breaks the double digits in this quarter of 10%+. Ever since the last quarter ended, June 30, 2024, there has been a steady stream of AI model improvements and api throughput improvements that are significant in scope. If you couple this with Google's continued AI spend and quality quarter, AI hardware channel checks that verify the AI hardware spend, and a github repo commit history that shows nothing but blazing improvements for Microsoft Azure intelligence; It could not be more clear to me that Microsoft is executing on all levels and should deliver a potentially monster quarter.

Not that it needs it but here is the plug for NVDA as well. All of those github commits and throughput improvements are directly related to Microsoft bringing data centers online all over the world.

This is insane! I don't have to tell you the git commits for this graph are absolutely bonkers too.

29,SMCI,"""frontier tech"" portfolio ","hey all, sharing what i'm calling my ""frontier tech"" portfolio, broken down by percentages. i'm looking for valuable input, feedback, and discussion around it. and, if it happens to be helpful to anyone, even better. i do want to clarify a few things:

* i'm focused on AI, bitcoin, and space. investment vehicles or not, i simply think each are tech frontiers that hold tons of promise, are poised for massive growth, and will bring immense amounts of value to the world over the next few decades. let's just call this a ""frontier tech"" portfolio, to give it a name i can reference.
* i'm not looking for feedback that just disagrees with that thesis. whether you think AI is all hype, or you are anti-Bitcoin and think it's a ponzi scheme, or you think space is a waste of resources, or anything along these lines - that's ok, i respect that perspective, but i'd like to avoid arguing about it. we just disagree about some fundamental things, and you won't convince me i'm simply wrong.
* i AM looking for feedback on blind spots, poor/missing assumptions, overconfidence, things i'm not considering, or any other constructive input that falls within the framework of the overall thesis. i'm not just looking for people to agree with me (though that is interesting input as well) - i just want feedback that can be applied within my overall investing philosophy.
* yes, i'm missing some key areas of what many would call ""frontier tech"" - biotech, green / nuclear energy, cybersecurity, to name a few - but i just don't have the same level of confidence in specific areas of those. i prefer to stay relatively focused on the categories where i'm most confident and able to stay up to date.
* i'm trying to keep my language somewhat appealing to a wide audience. not looking to get too bogged down in technical details or language that would alienate someone reading this stuff who's less familiar with one or any of the spaces/categories.
* my primary goal is a portfolio of funds and stocks that i can invest in with *strong long-term confidence in growth.* not stuff i trade frequently. and not stuff i love the idea of or that seems interesting / sexy but that i don't know enough about (SMCI, PLTR, altcoins as some good examples). i also generally prefer companies whose leadership i trust and/or admire.

ok, with that out of the way, let's dive in:

**30% AI** - 10% NVDA, 5% SOXQ, 15% balanced mixed of NOW, MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL, META, AMZN

* HIGH LEVEL: to me, this category is ABSOLUTELY going to change our world in fundamental ways over the next several decades. AI's potential is not chatGPT, or smarter versions of it. it's far beyond what we're seeing from LLMs today. if you listen to the engineers and operational leaders within the AI space, listen to not what they ""believe"" is gonna happen, but to what they know is coming because they've already used the tech, usually 1-2 years before the public even sees it, these people are overwhelmed, amazed, terrified, enchanted, bewildered. to me, that's just very interesting. i believe what some others do - that we're in the midst or on the verge of another technological revolution. i'm not bothered much that AI isn't monetizing in demonstrable, repeatable ways. i think there's been and continues to be enough fundamental, increasing advancement in this field that the value creation will absolutely surpass what most people think. as for the individual stocks, i'll do a quick dive here. to be clear, I don't think these are groundbreaking choices and many are very obvious. but, seems useful to give my favorite things about each:
* 10% NVDA - these guys are and will continue to be at the center of the whole thing. their moat is extensive. it's not just GPU / blackwell demand. it's their CUDA programming language and universe, and stickiness of it. it's the long-term horizon required for their data centers that makes 5-10 year customers out of everyone who buys their stuff. it's CEO jensen pushing them and already looking for the ""next big thing."" just a lot of confidence here.
* 5% SOXQ - i like this semiconductor ETF a little more than SMH because it's more diverse (SMH is like 25% NVDA, which is great if i didn't already allocate so much there), and it's got a low expense ratio (0.19%). i love this exposure because the AI industry is driven by these companies (e.g. TSMC, Micron, Broadcam, Qualcomm, AMD, AMAT).
* 15% mix of these...
   * NOW - excellent leadership and integrated heavily with NVDA tech; will benefit hugely from AI boom with AI-driven automation
   * META - founder-run and with a clear vision; demonstrating enormous resources and focus on building AI models, meeting consumer needs, being pioneers in tech at large
   * AAPL - will probably benefit the most from consumer-facing AI products and implementation; strong leadership
   * AMZN - AWS is a profit monster that will be huge for AI tools and services and data centers; logistics and ecom will be big AI beneficiaries; strong leadership
   * MSFT - deeply embedded in the AI revolution with its investment in OpenAI + AI integration into Azure and Microsoft 365; excellent leadership
   * GOOGL - AI pioneer with DeepMind / Brain; they still own search; have enormous amount of data; questionable leadership but I'm holding for now
* No TSLA??? no. i just don't trust elon musk enough at this point. and i need confidence in a company's leadership for me to invest in its stock. there's a big chance i'm missing out (their robotics division might be incredible), but I'm able to sleep OK with that.
* i'm also missing plenty of other AI picks. i know that. these are the ones i can invest in with the most confidence.

**30% Bitcoin** - 25% Bitcoin itself (cold storage or an ETF), 5% MSTR

* HIGH LEVEL: why Bitcoin? books have been written about it, but to shortly summarize my perspective - it's quite volatile and risky short-term, and quite growth-oriented and (thus far) safe long-term. excellent store of value. wonderful technology, math/code based, and may or may not upend some portion of the financial system. limited supply that's only decreasing over time. immutable. now adopted by many big institutions. goes on giant bull runs every 4 or so years. some days, it's hard to justify NOT putting more into this one, but for now i'm convinced that  diversification is the better long-term play.
* 20% Bitcoin - many would argue that holding actual Bitcoin, ideally off exchanges and on cold storage is the smartest play here. but there are also arguments for FBTC or IBIT (helpful in tax-advantaged accounts; trusting an ETF seems safer to some - very debatable). i do some cold storage, and some FBTC (they self-custody their Bitcoin, which not everyone does). either way, just Bitcoin. it's the only crypto play where my confidence level is very high.
* 5% MSTR - this is a leveraged Bitcoin play. strong chance it outpaces BTC growth rate during bull runs. i may shift some MSTR profits to Bitcoin over time if it starts to really offset my 4:1 BTC:MSTR ratio.

**30% Space** - 10% ASTS, 10% RKLB, 5% LUNR

* HIGH LEVEL: the tech for space finally seems to match the potential that's been talked about for decades and decades. for a while, space-x really proved this out, almost single-handedly. but we clearly have some strong other players either in or entering the category. my favorites are these three. here's why:
* 10% ASTS - you should read the kook report (google it) for a true deep dive, but to hit my high level points: they are pre-revenue but with the potential for MASSIVE growth. effectively, their satellite system aims to offer a global cellular network. think starlink but more b2b and generally better tech. they own tons of patents. they are 5+ years ahead of what many think will be a winner-takes-most race. their partners already include AT&amp;T, Verizon, Vodafone, Rakuten, American Tower, Bell Canada, and more. they have excellent leadership. i find this a risky-ish play as they have tons to still accomplish, but the potential growth is enormous.
* 10% RKLB - effectively, a space-x competitor on smaller rockets, with a fraction of the market cap and a huge runway for growth. i think still heavily undervalued today. nerdy/awesome leadership. vertically integrated. as telecom, defense, and general research spending expands to space economy, RKLB is positioned very, very well.
* 5% LUNR - i've spent less time researching them than the other two, but my confidence level in the risk/reward is still pretty high. key player in the lunar economy - one of few companies that can deliver payloads to the moon. very niche but valuable moat. huge potential, good amount of risks ahead.

**10% cash** - ...to buy them juicy dips.

ok, that's my ""frontier tech"" portfolio summary. to repeat - this is what i can confidently invest in for what i believe will be better-than-average returns over the next 10+ years. i recognize that this discussion didn't even really touch share price, EPS, P/E, profitability, revenue, or other key details. this just isn't the place where i'm getting into that. i can say that i'm comfortable with the financial metrics and details regarding these companies. but this discussion is mainly focused on what categories i think are poised for the most growth, and what companies/stocks/assets in those categories seem to be most positioned to lead that growth. thanks for reading.

46,SMCI,Ultra aggressive wheeling for a year,"https://preview.redd.it/mmz90e3oyytd1.png?width=504&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=761bbd5bf645586ee67053c90dac788fc1d2e0aa

So, I blew up my account gambling options a while back in 2023, took a break, and decided to join Thetagang last year. Suffered a -40k buying calls on a bear market and buying puts on a bull market (had about 85k in the market in total). Then I decided to start wheeling GME, and got in at $10, and sold some 15c, which got assigned when it ran it up 80, so missed out about 160k gain, which took me a while to get over, but profit is profit, which got me to \~60k.

Then I just kept wheeling GME (like 60% of port), DJT, CHEWY, HOOD, CELH, SMCI and a bunch of other stocks under 50. Occasionally, I'd sell CSP on NVDA or APPL, or AMD on big dips, but staying aggressive on riskier stocks for higher premiums. Got cocky and decided to add about 5k to my ROTH IRA recently and gambled on MSTR and META puts which blew up in a week, so you can see the drop from basically 80k -&gt; 76k, and now slowly going back at it.

Still down a few thousand overall, but happy to be back at 70k+. Going to continue with my high risk high reward wheeling and see where I'm at by the end of next year. My target is 150k by the end of 2025 but we'll see what happens. I absolutely hate GME since it touched me inappropriately on options, but right now it's just such a great stock to wheel \~20ish.

**Edit:** So I do understand that past performance does not equal future performance and we're in a bull market. But I will keep testing my strategy to see how well it performs since I'm not gambling options on my other accounts since they blew up. I will check back by year end, and my goal for that is 85k+, 100k+ would be nice. One thing to note is that I wheel weeklies, so I'm in and out of a stock sometimes in a couple weeks for stocks like DJT and SMCI that I don't plan to long-term wheel. If I don't like the prices at that time, I will find another stock. I try to find companies with decent premiums that typically performs well short-term. And on weeks where there are lots of news or earnings, or anything that could have a huge impact on the market, I sometime hold cash and buy the dip, or just hold cash and wait. I get interest on cash that I'm not investing on Fidelity too, so sometime I might hold the cash a bit longer if I can't find a good trade.",57,64,1728584981.0,2024-10-10T18:29:41+00:00,t3_1g0pmp1,thetagang,"Ultra aggressive wheeling for a year https://preview.redd.it/mmz90e3oyytd1.png?width=504&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=761bbd5bf645586ee67053c90dac788fc1d2e0aa

So, I blew up my account gambling options a while back in 2023, took a break, and decided to join Thetagang last year. Suffered a -40k buying calls on a bear market and buying puts on a bull market (had about 85k in the market in total). Then I decided to start wheeling GME, and got in at $10, and sold some 15c, which got assigned when it ran it up 80, so missed out about 160k gain, which took me a while to get over, but profit is profit, which got me to \~60k.

Given the AI valuation, SMCI seems heavily undervalued compared to its current trading price. The forward P/E and P/S ratios are especially intriguing, hinting that the stock could be a great long-term play if these projections hold any weight.

What are your thoughts? Is this AI valuation too optimistic, or are we looking at an undervalued gem here? Let’s discuss!

14,SMCI,"Super Micro soars after company says it's shipping over 100,000 AI GPUs per quarter","Super Micro Computer shares jumped 15% after the computer server company said it’s shipping more than 100,000 graphics processing units used for artificial intelligence per quarter.

That could translate into several billions of dollars of orders if the average price of a GPU is around the cost of Nvidia’s $30,000 chip. The GPU figure was revealed in an announcement about a new cooling product unveiled by Super Micro on Monday.

As one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom, Super Micro makes computers that companies use as servers for data storage, websites, AI training models and more. The company said its new cooling product will allow data centers to spend less on hardware costs and cooling infrastructure for servers that typically need to be running constantly.

Super Micro also said it recently deployed more than 100,000 GPUs with liquid cooling solution “for some of the largest AI factories ever built,” as well as other cloud service providers.

While the announcement was cheered by Wall Street, Super Micro is about nine weeks behind in reporting its annual report, which was expected in August. The company said late that month that management needed additional time “to complete its assessment of the design and operating effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting as of June 30, 2024.” 

Even after Monday’s rally, the stock is down by well over 50% since peaking in March. Shares fell 12% on Sept. 26, after the Wall Street Journal reported the Department of Justice opened a probe into the company following a report from short-seller Hindenburg Research in which the firm alleged it identified “fresh evidence of accounting manipulation.”

49,SMCI,Wheeling Stocks the Intended Way,"Posting this after the SMCI crash today, which left many facing margin calls or major losses. The key point of the wheel strategy is to supplement a long-term bullish position with premium income. Right now, ThetaGang feels like a slightly more knowledgeable version of WSB (WallStreetBets). If you're not comfortable owning SMCI, don't wheel it. The same applies to GME and other meme stocks.

The real profits in wheeling come from selling puts, which are often overpriced due to hedging. Instead of taking risky bets on random meme stocks for higher premiums, there's a better alternative: focus on companies with strong fundamentals like GOOG, AMZN, or SPX/SPY. The common complaint is, ""But I won't get my juicy premium!"" This reasoning is flawed in several ways.

First, ETFs tend to have the greatest Volatility Risk Premium (VRP)—the difference between Implied Volatility (IV) and Historical Volatility (HV). If you don't know what VRP is, ThetaGang might not be the right place for you.

Now, about returns: leverage/margin is the solution. While often seen as riskier, you're essentially betting on a more solid stock with stronger fundamentals and a higher VRP and volume. Of course, margin interest is a concern, but you can offset this by selling higher delta calls, to have the stack called away. While you won't capture as much VRP due to the volatility smile, you can still earn decent premium, enough to cover margin interest.

Let’s consider an example: SPX is currently trading at 5700. The 5-day-to-expiration (5DTE) Oct 4 5675 put, with a -0.3 delta, is around $22.50 (based on after-hours prices). This nets 0.4% weekly. Add 3x leverage, and you're looking at 1.2% weekly, which is a solid return. If SPX drops to 5650 (which is unlikely with low VIX), you can sell the 5725 call with a \~0.36 delta for around $26.00. This is approximately 0.45% per week, or 1.35% with leverage. Assuming delta is the probability of being in the money (ITM), you'd likely be able to sell the call \~3 times before assignment. This results in a theoretical 62% profit.

Of course, there will be times when SPX drops further, but elevated VIX will likely provide higher premiums. Using 3x leverage, you’re looking at approximately a 60% drawdown in a worst-case scenario.

**Management:**

* Don’t roll if you're challenged. Calls provide solid premium and the potential for capital gains (the whole point of the wheel). The same goes for calls—if you're still bullish, sell puts for delta exposure.
* Close puts early if the DTE/profit trade-off is favorable. I don’t believe in the 50% rule if you’re, say, 3/4 through expiration. However, if you gain 20% profit in an hour, feel free to close it. When to open a new position is up to your judgment.

Notes:  
I wouldn’t recommend selling options on SPX right now, given that theoretical values are higher than trading values. Modify your strategy based on VIX and market sentiment.

The Play: 
Options? You want 'em? Load up. Shares? Stack 'em. We’re not just hodling, we’re creating the next big **moon mission**. They’ve got Arc GPUs, Meteor Lake, and a battle plan to take down the chip overlords.

191,SMCI,Warning from the future when new AI HyperScalers are offered to public,"There’s no way for us regular joes to make or lose money on this.  This is coming someone who has worked in the field and still talks to people working in the field.  

In the near future you’ll have public offerings of AI HyperScalers like Cweave but be warned this is likely going to be pump and dump. 

I’m not saying this is right but there’s a lot of inconsistencies you should consider.   

I know everyone is going to say I’m wrong but I’ve correctly pointed AMD rise, INTC demise (this I am reminded every week that INTC is a value play but Intel has fallen every year for 6 years), NVDA becoming the most valuable company, SMCI scam.   Many of them years before it happens.  

Over half a decade  ago I was one of the first to test AMD server chips and thought the perfromance/watt would propel AMD this performance/watt ratio gap for anyone in the field is a dead giveaway INTC would dead company in the future.  How long I didn’t know but I knew Intel was a dying company 6+ years ago.  

https://old.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/9v1n6f/amazon_web_services_aws_pricing_amd_vs_intel/e994dka/

3 years ago when NVDA was under $300 I thought they would be the AI leader. I said it will probably triple in a 2 years even at it's inflated price and possibly the most valuable company in the world.

https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qw9glx/im_surprised_there_isnt_more_nvda_talk_before/

This is coming someone who has worked in the field and still talks to people working in the field.  

In the near future you’ll have public offerings of AI HyperScalers like Cweave but be warned this is likely going to be pump and dump. 

I’m not saying this is right but there’s a lot of inconsistencies you should consider.   

I know everyone is going to say I’m wrong but I’ve correctly pointed AMD rise, INTC demise (this I am reminded every week that INTC is a value play but Intel has fallen every year for 6 years), NVDA becoming the most valuable company, SMCI scam.   Many of them years before it happens.  

Over half a decade  ago I was one of the first to test AMD server chips and thought the perfromance/watt would propel AMD this performance/watt ratio gap for anyone in the field is a dead giveaway INTC would dead company in the future.  How long I didn’t know but I knew Intel was a dying company 6+ years ago.  

https://old.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/9v1n6f/amazon_web_services_aws_pricing_amd_vs_intel/e994dka/

3 years ago when NVDA was under $300 I thought they would be the AI leader. I said it will probably triple in a 2 years even at it's inflated price and possibly the most valuable company in the world.

https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qw9glx/im_surprised_there_isnt_more_nvda_talk_before/

Six months ago when SMCI was being pushed on to the public I said it was a scam to fleece retail.

192,SMCI,SMCI's form 12b-25 (notification of late filing) - a different outlook on the 10-K filing,"I saw SMCI's 12b-25 report when they filed it, however one thing I could not quite grasp - this check box in Part II:

https://preview.redd.it/lnpo84bpzgmd1.png?width=1155&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e190227038d54bbcb34248e82fd5db4a27c22456

  
I've read only a handful 12b-25 forms before that one, but only [one](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/883697/000114036111019521/doc1.htm) with the extension box unchecked, and that company [didn't do well afterwards](https://www.massdevice.com/regen-biologics-files-bankruptcy/).

Several financial outlets wrote that *Super Micro has assured that it will complete the filing within the stipulated extension period with minor performance revisions.*  
That bit of text got certain amount of attention and based on posts and comments all over, people seem to hold onto it. So I dismissed this whole check box thing and accept that we'll be getting the 10-K soon.

But that box kept bugging me, so today I scratched the surface just a little, and noticed that those few outlets all quoted one and the same source, Zacks Investment Research, and I didn't see anyone else other than them reporting it, let alone official statement.

So I dug a little deeper into it.

So now what? Maybe they will report it on time, but the company management obviously isn't sure (and therefore wouldn't check the extension box), so they distanced themselves from further accusations if the company doesn't file 10-K on time.  
One has to understand that filing a 12b-25 is not a thing you file to buy yourself some time because you think you will be able to fulfill your obligations on time, and all you need is just a simple extension, but because you're required to do so when you are late.  
  
Maybe nothing happens, but this just keeps getting more and more interesting!

TL;DR: SMCI didn't check the extension box on their 12b-25 filing, and the only reports saying they'll file on time are from one source, Zacks.

I've read only a handful 12b-25 forms before that one, but only [one](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/883697/000114036111019521/doc1.htm) with the extension box unchecked, and that company [didn't do well afterwards](https://www.massdevice.com/regen-biologics-files-bankruptcy/).

Several financial outlets wrote that *Super Micro has assured that it will complete the filing within the stipulated extension period with minor performance revisions.*  
That bit of text got certain amount of attention and based on posts and comments all over, people seem to hold onto it. So I dismissed this whole check box thing and accept that we'll be getting the 10-K soon.

But that box kept bugging me, so today I scratched the surface just a little, and noticed that those few outlets all quoted one and the same source, Zacks Investment Research, and I didn't see anyone else other than them reporting it, let alone official statement.

48,SMCI,Wheel strategy options assignment - need help please!!!,"
I have been having a really bad month financially. I had sold a lot of SMCI options (yes I know how bad this sounds now) that got assigned this week. My account went into margin. So, to help pay for the margin interest I sold covered call options for 442.5 that expired 8/30. The options expired out of the money so I thought I was safe from my stock getting called away. I even spoke to Charles Schwab representative and he confirmed that the stock would not get auto sold told me that if they don’t get exercised by 5.30 pm Eastern, then I’m safe. 

However, I woke up this morning to see that all my SMCI shares had been sold. I called them to check and they said they got randomly assigned and exercised and there’s nothing they can do about it.

Here’s what’s fishy: every time an exercise happens, Schwab sends a notification on the app, and also an email saying options have been exercised. However, I received no such notification or email- only thing I got was an auto email saying my shares were sold. 

So this seems like the notification I would have gotten if my shares were auto-sold by the exchange, which should not have happened as my options expired out of the money. 

Am I being crazy or is Schwab doing something fishy? Can any of you expert options traders help me out with this? I have lost a LOT of money (pretty much it has wiped out all my savings) due to this so any advise or thoughts would be helpful. Thank you!",8,83,1725113600.0,2024-08-31T14:13:20+00:00,t3_1f5o8f4,options,"Wheel strategy options assignment - need help please!!!

194,SMCI,SMCI - this is far from over,"SMCI has some nice niche products, but SMCI’s margins are tiny because they offer nothing proprietary.  
I have a feeling that they were on a roll, but the management couldn't quite keep up with success and the stock went up too high in valuation believing the company internally could keep up with the pressure.

For a company which has no moat, has shrinking margins and is again encompassed in accounting problems, I don't see an upside. I can understand that mistakes happen, but this is becoming a pattern recidivist behavior, and in my book, the trust is seriously shaken, if not lost.

I can understand skepticism around Hindenburg report, but withholding the release of annual report (10-K) is a big no no. Some jumped to SMCI's defense that they did so because of Hindenburg report to make double-checks, but why would you need to double-check a report which was previously audited by independent party (EY) and is supposed to be ready for submitting weeks ahead of deadline?  
For those that aren't aware, 10-K is a kind of report that contains comprehensive overview of company's financial performance over the past fiscal year, but also includes audited financial statements, unlike quarter reports which are less detailed and are unaudited ([link to 10-Q](https://app.quotemedia.com/data/downloadFiling?webmasterId=90423&amp;ref=318292688&amp;type=HTML&amp;symbol=SMCI&amp;cdn=f006c6d17a8677ce2f9e8b184a14bbb0&amp;companyName=Super+Micro+Computer+Inc.&amp;formType=10-Q&amp;formDescription=General+form+for+quarterly+reports+under+Section+13+or+15%28d%29&amp;dateFiled=2024-05-06)). 10-K also includes discussion and analysis (MD&amp;A), risk factors, organizational structure, executive compensation, subsidiaries, and more.

I believe that, at least partially, the reason lies in that (to quote [mod from SCMI subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/SMCI_Stock/comments/1emlh0s/comment/lklblb9/?context=3)) *SMCI was very cheap in 2022 and 2023 when the circumstances were different. Nobody knew about their success back then, which allowed them to avoid competition and actually increase sales and margins.*  
*Now is a different story: they are at diseconomies of scale and diluting shareholders to finance their operations. I wouldn’t be surprised to see SMCI drop to the 300s or lower and never recover because they are just a commodity company now.*  
Dell, HPE and Lenovo aren't resting and have joined the server building market in the meantime.

I missed out on yesterday's massive drop in SMCI. If I had bought the 20240830 $400 put at the market open yesterday and sold it around noon, I could have made a 10x return in just 3 hours. Instead, my money is tied up in ASTS puts, which might take 2-4 weeks to achieve a 10x return.  


Regarding my strategy, after posting last time and seeing everyone's replies, I realized that the 8/30 puts were a bit risky, so I sold them and moved the remaining funds into the 10/18 puts. In hindsight, switching to further-dated puts seemed like a safer choice, as I couldn't gauge how irrational people might be in pushing the stock price up, thinking that the September launch was a positive catalyst. But in the end, it appears that people were already expecting a drop after the launch date, so they started taking profits early, causing the stock price to decline. If I hadn't switched out of the 8/30 puts, I would have made more profit by now.

https://preview.redd.it/ywt3t1x6ukld1.png?width=1328&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b46fd97f624163aaf8c85275e13b1f6e48f6564

  
Next, I want to explain my current viewpoint and stock price prediction. I believe that within a month, the stock will drop to the $13.6-$16.6 range seen around 7/25, and within two months, it could fall to the $6.17-$9.02 range seen around 5/29.

My views are as follows:

1. **Warrants causing significant equity dilution:** Regarding the warrants I mentioned last time, I regret not studying bond market theory and accounting seriously when I was pursuing my master's in financial engineering. Indeed, it's not a cash loss on the balance sheet, and if the company redeems the warrants, it will receive cash, offsetting the initial loss and increasing shareholders' equity. This is what I meant by equity dilution, though I don't know why it wasn't clearly stated in the article—probably because I used ChatGPT to translate it (from Traditional Chinese to English), and the AI servers that train ChatGPT are manufactured by SMCI.The previously issued warrants will inevitably be exercised after the stock price has increased tenfold or twentyfold, leading to equity dilution, which will cause the stock price to drop further. The current candlestick chart looks like a falling knife. Many fools believe that the CEO's statement that there will be no new stock issuance this fiscal year means that they are safe and that equity won't be diluted. However, ASTSW has been trading all along, and convertible bonds are not new stock issuances. Based on ASTS's past methods of raising funds, issuing convertible bonds is quite common. We cannot be certain that they won't issue convertible bonds in the second half of 2024 to raise funds. Convertible bonds themselves are a potential factor for equity dilution. For instance, the convertible bonds issued in January of this year can be converted in January 2025 at a conversion price of $5.75. In other words, as long as the stock price is higher than $5.75 in January next year, it will lead to another wave of new equity dilution.
2. **Satellite launch is a positive catalyst, but won't drive the stock price up:** I believe that the satellite launch will undoubtedly be successful, and while this is indeed a positive catalyst, often when the good news is fully priced in, the stock's downward trend begins. Moreover, after the satellite launch, whether the satellites operate normally in orbit and whether the results match the past test satellites' performance remain uncertainties, potentially causing negative impacts. Most importantly, after launching 5 satellites, are the next 20 satellites ready? Currently, there's no news, and at most, only the funding is in place. I estimate that it will take at least a year before the next batch of 20 satellites can be launched, and the stock price cannot be maintained by news of a launch happening a year later. Therefore, a pullback is inevitable. If there is news of delays in satellite production (which is not impossible for this company, given their track record), I wouldn't be surprised if the stock price drops back to $2.
3. **Starlink, the biggest competitor, has already captured the potential satellite communication market share:** I've seen many DD (due diligence) posts claiming that ASTS is the only company offering satellite-to-phone services and that even Starlink can't achieve this capability, so ASTS will capture this entire market worth billions. They argue that Starlink might be forced to acquire ASTS at a high price to complete the satellite-to-phone service. Such foolish remarks are endless.I want to say, who do you think Elon Musk is? Do you think he can't negotiate with ECC? Not to mention, Elon Musk recently tweeted on X that he is willing to provide free emergency satellite communication services, directly nullifying ASTS's government revenue.[Link to Elon Musk's tweet](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1828527049541108055?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1828527049541108055%7Ctwgr%5E9f9eb41fa3320da12fc0420d46ed588b02d80deb%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techbang.com%2Fposts%2F117862-starlink-mobile-emergency-service)(Musk didn't even mention ASTS in his tweet, reflecting that Musk doesn't see ASTS as a competitor at all, nor as a potential acquisition target.)Therefore, when considering government contract revenue for satellite communications, remember to remove it from ASTS's projections! [Link to the Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASTSpaceMobile/comments/1f1qsef/scotia_bank_4590_pt_upgrade_report/#lightbox) This is the Scotia Bank $45.90 PT Upgrade Report. According to this, which seems like a projection obtained after inputting a ton of cheat codes in a single-player game, ""Military, government &amp; initial commitments as % of total sales"" is 100% for 2024E and 90% for 2025E. In other words, one tweet from Musk has almost wiped out the next two years' expected revenue.
4. **Satellite-to-phone technology is not irreplaceable:** Continuing from the previous point, DD keeps claiming that ASTS is the only satellite-to-phone service provider and that it has over 3,700 patents, creating a wide moat... OK, using the number of patents as a measure of a moat is valid, but only if the castle inside the moat really contains gold and if others can't dig a tunnel or fly over it.The idea of satellite-to-phone service is good, but it must be used outdoors without obstruction. For those who might live in remote rural areas, if they collapse in a basement, they won't be able to send a distress signal. You still need additional equipment like Starlink's to use it indoors in remote areas. So the 3,700+ patents might be as useless as Nokia's patents for keyboard phones.
5. **Severe overestimation of target prices by investment banks and DD:** I believe any projections beyond 18 months are for reference only, just like the packaging on instant noodles. Take NVDA, a company I consider good: you know that its current AI chip is Hopper, Blackwell will be produced in Q4, and Rubin is in development. They can only clearly plan about a year and a half ahead. The rest is just price shouting by others, with credibility akin to flipping a coin.Therefore, analysts' target prices in stock reports are based on a 12-month forecast, not now, and definitely not for the short-term stock price over the next month or two that I'm focusing on. So when I see the Scotia Bank $45.90 PT Upgrade Report, I think it's either from one of the SPACEMOBs or from someone aiming to short the stock, setting a price that SPACEMOBs cannot refuse. The report even makes detailed projections up to 2032, and all the growth rates seem as if there is only one company in the world with communication satellites, and all users have to obediently pay ASTS. It even suggests that AT&amp;T and VZ's businesses will only consist of satellite communications, and ASTS will be able to generate an astonishing $42 billion in revenue in 2032 with just 475 satellites. If that were the case, Musk or other companies developing satellite communications should be ashamed, as they have far more than 475 satellites but have yet to generate such high revenue.Besides this ridiculously optimistic report, I've also seen some DD posts making exaggerated claims about AT&amp;T's future service revenue, such as 50% going to AT&amp;T and 50% to ASTS, or that the potential user base of companies currently in cooperation is 2.8 billion, with each person paying $10 per month.I want to say that AT&amp;T has invested millions in ASTS as an advance payment for services. In other words, ASTS has already received its revenue until 2030 from AT&amp;T. It remains to be seen whether additional service revenue from other companies will be reflected in financial reports.Calculating revenue based on a potential user base of 2.8 billion is also extremely unreasonable. For me, in my country, other than walking into a basement, the number of times I've been in a place without cell signal in a year is zero, so I probably won't be an ASTS user. I also can't use ASTS to watch YouTube videos via its 5G signal, as my current internet speed is already 500 Mbps. By the time ASTS starts offering broadband services, my ISP might already be offering 6G, with speeds of up to 10 Gbps.

So who would really need ASTS's broadband services except for outdoor emergency situations? And let's not forget, Musk has already taken over the emergency communication market.",0,89,1724926358.0,2024-08-29T10:12:38+00:00,t3_1f3yrd6,wallstreetbets,"ASTS DD and YOLO part.2

198,SMCI,Reasons why SMCI is the Next NVIDIA,"
As you all know SMCI was once at 1200 six months ago, but because smart money in a bid to make profit sold their shares to retail traders all the way down to 400 …putting their profits in lame stocks that are yes outperforming the market …but those stocks aren’t SMCI.

Of course us retail traders on Reddit know more than these institutions. We also know it isn’t our fault we kept buying all the way down leaving many with a cost basis of $800. It’s their fault for wanting to put their money in better performing names.

Guess what though SMCI is the next Nvidia. They will regret the day they sold out of a company with profit margin pressures that loses customers to Dell and HPE. 

What makes SMCI the next NVDA…900 points. 

Yes SMCI may not have any propriety tech or moat, and yes they may not be the only server builder with liquid cooled servers, and yes they no longer get first dibs at NVDA GPU’s… but did those other companies stock go up 900 points in 3 months! The answer is NO…they did not. And that is why SMCI is the next NVDA. Sure it doesn’t innovate any IP and has a difficult time maintaining profit margins and keeping customers, but it did go up 900 points.

199,SMCI,Are $SMCI Problems $NVDA Gains?,"The collapse of $SMCI is causing some (like Sylvia Jablonski from Defiance ETF's) to say they're buying the dip, while others consider it catastrophic for the company given the ""accounting manipulation"" claim from Hindenburg Research. Their market cap is paltry compared to Nvidia, the company which the world is waiting on right now. $NVDA is down a little bit right now which happens from time to time, and their earnings will probably look stellar, I'm sure.

At the end of the day, it's unlikely this is the end of the rainbow (sorry to the bears) but it does call into question whether the market will temporarily halt excitement on semiconductor stocks in general (the leader of course being Nvidia) or if it is just an isolated incident.

Either people are pulling out of $SMCI like it's the end because it is, or maybe everybody is just rushing in to capitalize on the continued rise of Nvidia. The question is really about whether the entire sector is wrought with fraud, and if so, will that actually impact anything broadly, or if it's just this one company that's getting punished for it now.

202,SMCI,S&amp;P 500 Additions Sept. 6 ,"The S&amp;P is rebalanced four times a year. Two weeks before the rebalancing, they announce which companies will be added and removed from the index. The next rebalancing occurs on Sept. 20, which means they will announce the additions and deletions to the index on Sept. 6 after the market close.

S&amp;P rebalancing is one of my favorite trades because it has asymmetric risk-reward. If the stock is added to the index, it usually goes up 5-10%. If it isn't added, it usually only goes down 1-3%. I've made a small fortune in the past with this technique by successfully predicting the additions of Palo Alto, Blackstone, and Crowdstrike.

The S&amp;P 500 selection committee does have some requirements for a stock to join the index. Generally speaking, the company needs to be profitable for four quarters and have a minimum market cap of 18 billion. The full list of requirements is here on pages 7-12 of the PDF file. [https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/methodologies/methodology-sp-us-indices.pdf](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/methodologies/methodology-sp-us-indices.pdf)

Here is list of potential candidates based on market cap: 

NOTE: Some of these are not profitable and therefore ineligible for S&amp;P500 inclusion. This is not a comprehensive list, there are dozens of potential companies. Do your own DD.  

Apollo Global

Palantir

Workday

Doordash

Ares

Datadog

Applovin

Snowflake (unlikely because of stock volatility)

Cheniere

Tradedesk

Square/Block

Dell (maybe a float issue? Otherwise, I am unsure why it hasn't been added yet)

Veeva

PINS

Vertiv

Hubpot

Carlisle

Cloudflare



Here are a list of companies that are ineligible companies to save you some time:

Roblox (negative EPS)

Atlassian (neg trailing EPS)

Coinbase (neg trailing EPS)

Arm (ADR)

CRH (Not eligible until next rebalancing)

My theory: The last few additions to the S&amp;P 500 have been a humiliation for S&amp;P. Crowdstrike had a massive outage and SMCI is being exposed as a fraud. They will probably pick a safer company this time. SMCI might be removed from the index at this point because this is the second time they've had accounting irregularities. 

What are your favorite stocks for inclusion on Sept 6th? They usually add and remove 2-5 companies every quarter. The number can be higher or lower because of M&amp;A, bankruptcies, etc.

# [S&amp;P 500 futures tick lower as Wall Street looks toward Nvidia earnings: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/27/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; S&amp;P 500 futures inched lower Tuesday night as investors waited in anticipation for chipmaker Nvidia’s quarterly earnings announcement Wednesday after the bell.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the broad market index slipped 0.16%, while Nasdaq 100 futures dropped 0.31%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures lost 18 points, or 0.04%.
*****
&gt; In after-hours action, Nordstrom advanced 7% after the retailer posted adjusted earnings in the second quarter that surpassed expectations. Semiconductor developer Ambarella jumped nearly 20% on upbeat revenue guidance in the third quarter. PVH, owner of Calvin Klein, slumped more than 7% on a disappointing outlook for the current quarter.
*****
&gt; During Tuesday’s trading session, the broad market index and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite both added nearly 0.2%. Nvidia posted a roughly 1.5% gain that helped buoy both indexes. The 30-stock Dow, meanwhile, added just 0.02% — just enough to post a second straight record close.
*****
&gt; Wall Street is keeping an eye on Nvidia, the leader of the artificial intelligence trade, to gauge the broader sustainability of the broader tech and AI trade. The semiconductor giant has surged 159% in 2024, raising questions of how much more room there is for the stock to run.
*****
&gt; Focal points for investors include the delivery schedule for Nvidia’s Blackwell chips and an update on the demand for AI.
*****
&gt; “It’s hard to say that there’s not a lot of optimism priced into the market tomorrow,” Erin Browne, Pimco managing director and portfolio manager, told CNBC’s “Closing Bell” on Tuesday.
*****
&gt; Browne noted that other AI stocks are trading around 10% below their all-time highs. Nvidia’s current valuation is not expensive relative to the five-year average, she added.
*****
&gt; “So while certainly there’s a lot of optimism priced in, I think that they still can deliver upside and surprise the market to the upside,” Browne said.
*****
&gt; Elsewhere on the earnings front, Bath &amp; Body Works, Foot Locker and Kohl’s are some of the names slated to report their quarterly results Wednesday morning. In addition to Nvidia in the afternoon, investors will also be looking toward Salesforce’s earnings.

18,SMCI,AMD to acquire server builder ZT Systems for $4.9 billion in cash and stock,"Advanced Micro Devices on Monday said it plans to acquire server maker ZT Systems for $4.9 billion as the company seeks to expand its portfolio of artificial intelligence chips and hardware and battle Nvidia.

AMD plans to pay for 75% of the ZT Systems acquisition with cash and the remainder in stock. The company had $5.34 billion in cash and short-term investments as of the second quarter.

The computing requirements for AI have dictated that tech companies string together thousands of chips in clusters to achieve the necessary amount of data crunching horsepower. Stringing together the vast numbers of chips has meant the makeup of whole server systems has become increasingly important, which is why AMD is acquiring ZT Systems.

“AI systems are our number one strategic priority,” AMD CEO Lisa Su said in an interview with Reuters.

The addition of ZT Systems engineers will allow AMD to more quickly test and roll out its latest AI graphics processing units (GPUs) at the scale cloud computing giants such as Microsoft require, Su said.

“The main way (ZT Systems) is additive to the company is we sell more GPUs,” Su said.

AMD plans to break off its server manufacturing business and sell it once the deal closes, as it has no plans to compete with companies such as Super Micro Computer, Su said.

AMD has not yet held talks with potential buyers.

ZT Systems Chief Executive Frank Zhang will join AMD and report to AMD’s data center chief, Forrest Norrod.

The closely held ZT Systems has roughly 2,500 employees of which AMD plans to retain about 1,000 engineers. Currently, ZT Systems generates annual revenue of roughly $10 billion, Su said.

Executives expect the deal to close in the first half of 2025 and expect an additional 12 to 18 months to sell the manufacturing business.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said at the company’s developer conference in March that the one-time chip designer now creates and sells entire data centers, or the individual components needed to build one. This year analysts expect the company to generate $105.9 billion from its data center segment, which includes chips and other AI hardware. Su said last month the company expects to collect roughly $4.5 billion worth of AI chip revenue this year. The company’s customers include Microsoft and Meta Platforms.

AMD expects ZT Systems to contribute to the company’s adjusted financial performance by the end of 2025.

55,SMCI,My ITM Covered Call Scanner - WIP,"Thanks to all the commenters so far who've helped point out the fairly obvious calculation errors I've been making in previously deleted posts where I was asking for feedback about my strategy and approach.

I do believe I have the values correct now though!

So the gist of it, is that, with a little more effort, you can get a higher ROR than a CSP by buying the shares outright, and then immediately selling an ITM call against those shares.

If the stock breaches your short call, you keep the shares and begin to incur losses if larger drawdowns occur. If the stock goes up, your shares are called away, and you keep the premium, ready to find another trade to enter.

From doing some quick math, an ITM CC usually nets you about 20% higher return on risk than a CSP. As someone who doesn't have access to portfolio margin on Robinhood, an ITM CC is also attractive to me since I can use margin to purchase the shares, this type of leverage isn't available when selling CSPs.

Here's the output after scanning all the tech stocks.

Happy to hear any feedback or criticisms about my approach, but I think? I finally have the math correct now and can focus on next steps.",5,17,1723875919.0,2024-08-17T06:25:19+00:00,t3_1eub57m,thetagang,"My ITM Covered Call Scanner - WIP Thanks to all the commenters so far who've helped point out the fairly obvious calculation errors I've been making in previously deleted posts where I was asking for feedback about my strategy and approach.

I do believe I have the values correct now though!

So the gist of it, is that, with a little more effort, you can get a higher ROR than a CSP by buying the shares outright, and then immediately selling an ITM call against those shares.

If the stock breaches your short call, you keep the shares and begin to incur losses if larger drawdowns occur. If the stock goes up, your shares are called away, and you keep the premium, ready to find another trade to enter.

From doing some quick math, an ITM CC usually nets you about 20% higher return on risk than a CSP. As someone who doesn't have access to portfolio margin on Robinhood, an ITM CC is also attractive to me since I can use margin to purchase the shares, this type of leverage isn't available when selling CSPs.

Here's the output after scanning all the tech stocks.

209,SMCI,SMCI BAG HOLDERS ASSEMBLE,"ATTENTION SMCI PEEPS

We need to speak up and meet in person at the SMCI headquarters and have a talk with Charles. Basically he needs to fix this. The earnings call could have gone a lot better if he just fudged the numbers a little bit. Why did he have to be so literal and kill the vibe. 

Sometimes the truth is not the best course of action…sometimes a CEO needs to be creative and say the business isn’t f’d from competition by other companies. To hell with HPE and Dell. Outside of them offering more services like cloud backup and customer support, they can’t even hold a candle to SMCI which once traded at $1200 without any IP or moat whatsoever. 

Charles needs us and our opinions. Maybe if we explain to him nicely that the stock needs to be at 1200 so many of us can break even, he will understand our plight. 

My suggestion is that he puts out a video and retracts some of his previous statements about margin  pressure. Just say “oh I totally messed up these numbers. We actually are at 14% profit not 11%. Doug the assistant made a typo when handing me the GAAP numbers. Not to worry we laid him off. So that frees up another 80k for CAPEX from Doug’s salary.” Or something along those lines. Maybe he can get all his work buddies together as well and buy some company stock to boost it from the inside. 

Anyone have any other suggestions? 

Also, Iif anyone knows Nancy Pelosi or has a way to get a hold of her maybe we can explain our situation in hopes she buys some options or shares in SMCI. That will get it to 1200 in a weeks time.

210,SMCI,Something's Off with SMCI Stock Price - Thoughts?,"I've been keeping an eye on SMCI (Super Micro Computer, Inc.) stock, and something just feels really off with the price action lately. I attached a graph that shows their earnings, revenue, and stock price trends over the last few years, and honestly, it’s pretty confusing.

Here’s what’s going on in the graph:

1. **Earnings &amp; Revenue:** The company’s revenue (those brown bars) and earnings (green arrows and circles) have been steadily increasing, which you’d think would be a good thing for the stock price.
2. **Stock Price:** Despite the solid growth in earnings and revenue, the stock price (blue line) has been all over the place. There’s this huge spike to crazy highs and then a sharp drop. It just doesn’t seem to match up with how the company’s actually performing.

What’s really weird is that we’re still holding on to stocks we bought for $900 even though the price is now dropping below $500. It just doesn’t make sense logically. Usually, you’d expect a stock to go up steadily if a company’s doing well, not be this unpredictable.

Is anyone else noticing this strange behavior with SMCI? Why are we holding on despite the drop? Are we missing something here? I’d love to hear your thoughts because this just doesn’t add up for me.

Net sales came in at $5.31 billion, a substantial increase from $2.18 billion year-over-year, yet slightly missing the expected $5.32 billion. Despite these mixed results, the company announced a 10-for-1 stock split, initially driving shares up 18% before a sharp reversal to a 7% decline due to weak margins.

The reversal is notable as the company provided a strong outlook and announced the share split which usually is viewed as favorable by traders.

217,SMCI,"SMCI - Ideals are full, but reality isn't","Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) announced its third-quarter and next year's outlook after the market closed. The 2025 revenue is expected to exceed the market expectation of $23.6 billion, with the company estimating annual revenue to be between $26 billion and $30 billion. Additionally, they announced a 10-for-1 stock split in October, both considered positive news.

🚨 However, the second-quarter financial report is not looking good. Although the revenue of $5.31 billion slightly exceeded the market expectation of $5.3 billion, the adjusted EPS was only $6.25, far below the market expectation of $8.07.

In simple terms, the financial report and forecast have mixed results, causing the stock price to experience extreme volatility in after-hours trading. Initially, it surged by more than 20%, but then selling pressure quickly emerged, causing a vertical drop. Currently, it has fallen by more than 11%, showing dramatic fluctuations that truly live up to its reputation as a volatile stock 📉.

I believe this is mainly because the market is still focused on whether the AI theme can achieve actual returns. After the valuation is highly inflated, profits must be significantly better than the market expects.

👉 The issue with Super Micro Computer is not just that the EPS is below expectations, but the gap with the market expectation of $8.07 is very large. This discrepancy is the largest in the past five years for any quarter. This high discrepancy occurred because investors were overly optimistic about the growth of AI servers, resulting in such a large deviation in actual profits. This perfectly illustrates the saying ""ideals are very full, but reality is very skinny.""

Additionally, the second-quarter gross profit margin quickly dropped to only 11.2%, down 5.8% from the same period last year, and more than 4% lower than the 15.5% in the first quarter, hitting a new low since May 2007. A continuous decline in gross profit margin is definitely not a good sign; just look at Tesla. Although Super Micro Computer's revenue continues to grow and slightly exceeds expectations, the gross profit margin is rapidly declining. Selling more but earning less will make the market worry that this industry might be getting too competitive.

Thankfully no single trade max loss was greater than 2% of portfolio (realistically, the biggest max loss was a little over half a percent). Still took an overall loss for the week due to SMCI and HOOD, but because of risk management, only lost .2% (yes, less than a quarter percent).

62,SMCI,First 6 weeks of wheeling,"This is a follow-up to [my first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/1dx6h8b/first_3_weeks_of_wheeling/), 3 weeks later. I've had 2 terrible weeks trading - my head just wasn't in the game, probably because I was on vacation. I did manage to wrap my head around getting assigned and potentially owning shares - not out of necessity but based on the feedback from the last post, it was the biggest (and valid) complaint towards my strategy, so it was what I used the holiday to work on.

A few noteworthy stories:

I opened a new CELH trade rushing to the airport. As I was sitting in the cab it was down by quite a bit - bad timing. 150 contracts, $50P, sold at $0.67. It started looking good as boarding began so I had to get wifi on the plane to enter the closing trade due to my 50% rule. If you've ever used wifi on a plane ... it took me at least 2 hours.

Then began the bad part ... began with a Netflix position that seemed too good to be true. A few minutes into the position it dawned on me that it was an earnings trade. I basically opened and closed at the same price 2 days later ($50 gain on one trade, $25 loss on another), and missed a couple of actually decent trade opportunities. The result: that week performed terribly. And even worse: Had I held the position to expiry, I'd have made $10k. But I would have also held the contract over earnings, which is one of the things to avoid obviously. So I am happy I didn't tempt fate.

Lesson learned: I've made a pre-trade checklist, which includes to check the earnings date. The NFLX trade isn't in the trade log below, I will get it added later - it was a busy few days as I'm scaling into my daily routine again.

The last 2 days otoh I've hit a few home-runs. The trade on SNOW printed - I've been watching this one like a hawk, even signed up and atteneded one of their customer onboarding seminars. Then CRWD shut down the world, and I was sure I would have to take a position. SMCI ... to be honest I've removed it from my watchlist now. I've traded it very well, but I feel too comfortable opening the position and not comfortable enough to hold it. I'll take that as a sign not to play with fire. Anyway, I managed $18k in 2 days and only max risked 25% over my cash in the account, which I would have been able to locate within a few hours.

Risk management wise I am happy that I managed to close SMCI and CRWD trades where I did. I should have closed them at 50% value, but at the same time the momentum was in my favor so I let it rip a bit. Does anyone have any better suggestions how to play such a situation without having to maintain the risk of going back above 50% value?

224,SMCI,"SMCI: Attractive Valuation, Great Potential","**POST-EARNINGS UPDATE:**

SMCI just delivered very disappointing Q4 results as gross margin (11.2% v 15.5%) and EPS (6.25 v 8.1) fell short of the lower bound of their previous update. The problem with FCF has also become severe.

Although their revenue guidance is still optimistic, **I no longer buy their EPS prediction**. Therefore, I need to acknowledge that my prior understanding of this company is wrong.

**I now downgrade my rating of this stock, from overweight to underweight. The price target is adjusted from 1050 to 600.**

**The earnings, on the other side, confirm that NVDA has a very strong quarter.**

**Original Post:**

AI frenzy is unfinished, yet the broader market suffered from a significant retreat this week. The PHLX Semiconductor Index dipped 6.86% on Wednesday, the worst performance since the pandemic. NVDA barely holds the 118 level, while other stocks such as MU, QCOM, AMAT, LRCX, ASML, etc., have dipped below key price levels. They are seeking support on MA120 (or at an even lower price).

I am paying attention to **SMCI**, a stock that may be less focused these days. SMCI lost more than 12% this week and closed at a price below 800. However, this dip has offered unique opportunities, reducing its post-earning risks, and making the price very attractive. Here is my analysis.

0. My Position:

**18 SMCI 01/17/2025 1200 C, 6 bought this Wednesday and Thursday at an average price of 71.6. My average cost is now 110. Although I have suffered a loss of 35%, I am sure that this is just temporary.**

1. Valuation:

**SMCI is trading at a PE TTM of 44.63 and a 1-yr forward PE of 22.17**. This is a very attractive price given its growth this year and the year to come. As a comparison, DELL is trading at a 1-yr forward PE of 16.17, with its growth much slower than that of SMCI.

SMCI is offering the market its unique stack-scale liquid-cooling system that can customized. With the surging demand for liquid cooling for AI server applications (especially the application of the NVDA B series), I expect SMCI to expand its portion in the AI server market while maintaining its current gross margin. The fundamentals of the corp are solid and I see great visibility in its future performance.

2. Technical:

SMCI is trading at a support level of 760-805 which is ultrastrong, which marks the dividing line between the bullish and bearish momentum. We can see that this level has been tested multiple times in the past 2 months, while strong buying has supported the stock in this range. All MAs (up to MA120) have converged, indicating the bottom consolidation to come to an end.

Besides, **the current price is only 7% higher than the closing price of the previous earnings call, while its peers in the semiconductor industry have surged by more than 20% (e.g., 25% for NVDA).** This indicates that the market may have digested the possible scenario of the stock failing to deliver results that are good enough. This risk-off emotion will help relieve some post-earning risks.

3. The broader semiconductor industry:

ASML delivered very good Q2 results, with a &lt;2% miss on its revenue guidance for Q3. TSM just delivered a blockbusting earnings report that beat the top and bottom lines on both quarterly performance and guidance. This indicates that chipmakers such as NVDA are having a very good season with demands surging even more than before. **This indicates that SMCI is also having a very great season where I expect its revenue and EPS to beat its bar which has far exceeded the market consensus**.

4. Rating:

**I now initiate an 'Outperform' rating for SMCI. The 12-month price target is set to be 1050, which indicates a potential upside of about 35%.**

The expected forward valuation is about 30, somewhat larger than its peers simply because of its growth.",11,24,1721431931.0,2024-07-19T23:32:11+00:00,t3_1e7hquw,wallstreetbets,"SMCI: Attractive Valuation, Great Potential **POST-EARNINGS UPDATE:**

SMCI just delivered very disappointing Q4 results as gross margin (11.2% v 15.5%) and EPS (6.25 v 8.1) fell short of the lower bound of their previous update. The problem with FCF has also become severe.

Although their revenue guidance is still optimistic, **I no longer buy their EPS prediction**. Therefore, I need to acknowledge that my prior understanding of this company is wrong.

**I now downgrade my rating of this stock, from overweight to underweight. The price target is adjusted from 1050 to 600.**

**The earnings, on the other side, confirm that NVDA has a very strong quarter.**

This is a daily watchlist for trading.

I might trade all the stocks on here, or none of them, on any given day. I might trade stocks that do not appear on here! I hold no positions in any stocks long-term but Amazon/Mag7/general broad market indices. (unless otherwise noted in these tickers). If you are on old reddit, click “show images” at the top to see all the charts quickly.

I usually make these watchlists premarket, but can be delayed if I am trading the open. These are not mean to be taken as gospel or any recommendation to buy/sell.

Many stocks I post are &lt;$500M market cap. These are potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. PLEASE ask specific ones. Questions like “Thoughts on \_\_\_\_\_?” will be ignored unless you add detail to the question. “Is \_\_\_ a good investment?” will be ignored. Please don't be a jerk.

Nobody is doing these people any favors by ""helping"" them. In my opinion the only appropriate response is to tell people not to trade these products for their own good.

65,SMCI,First 3 weeks of wheeling,"I'm new, so please be gentle ... :) I've got 3 options books on the way to become more comfortable with the fundamentals. I've got about 5 years of stock experience, but based on my character - and past results - buy and hold is not my cup of tea.

I've got a substantial pile of money (at least to me) that I've decided that I need to make income on. The money isn't ""mine"", it belongs to the company that I am the sole owner of. I therefore have an aversion to being long stocks, just because mentally this is cash that could be put to use to buy equipment, open up new locations, etc. However, the cash has been growing over time and it's just sitting there.

In the next few months for sure interest rate cuts will start to happen. Some money is in my company's brokerage account to collect cash interest (IBKR, 4.8%), other money I have put towards higher yielding deposits at various banks (\~5.25%). I've currently allocated about 5% of my cash reserves for CSP following a few weeks of researching the options wheel and doing some paper-trades. I live in a jurisdiction that has no capital gains taxes, so buying and holding dividend-stocks is also an issue since the taxes are automatically subtracted.

The biggest debate I have in my head is to either open up a lot of smaller trades or continue doing less but larger trades. It currently takes me about an hour to set up a trade following a strategy of RSI, daily MA(200) and also waiting for the price to move significantly closer to my strike price. I've set a limit of &lt; $1M for all CSP trades active, and I keep \~$50k around in case I see a good opportunity.

Here are the trades I have done so far:

This is my strategy for opening positions:

* Delta of 0.1 - 0.3
* 0-31DTE
* RSI &lt; 30
* Annualized return of &gt;10%
* Close position if 50% within 24hrs
* Close position if 80% within 48hrs
* Close position if worth $0.01
* Roll if possible, wheel if assigned

And these are the results (before fees):

W25: $10,600.50 (1.13%, 58.6% ann)  
W26: $  5,210.50 (0.55%, 28.8% ann)  
W27: $  6,759.00 (0.72% 37.39% ann)

or 41.6% average annualized.

The CELH trade was the longest dated expiry contract I've made, but I closed it after only 1 day since the stock ripped upwards, and my option was past 50% profit the next morning. It was by far my most successful (lucky) trade. My 2nd best trade - SMCI - was a 0DTE. Although my mind tells me these weren't any more risky than the other trades, the high profit seems to suggest otherwise (?)

20,SMCI,Dell and Partners Join Forces to Build AI Factory for Elon Musk's xAI,"Dell Technologies and Super Micro Computer are collaborating to provide server racks for a supercomputer being developed by Elon Musk's artificial intelligence startup, xAI. This supercomputer will power the next version of xAI's generative AI chatbot, Grok, and is expected to be operational by fall 2025.

# Key Takeaways

* Dell and Super Micro Computer are providing server racks for xAI's supercomputer.
* The supercomputer will power the next version of xAI's AI chatbot, Grok.
* The project is expected to be completed by fall 2025.
* The collaboration involves Nvidia's advanced AI GPUs.

# Dell and Super Micro's Role

Dell Technologies and Super Micro Computer are key players in the development of xAI's supercomputer. Dell is responsible for assembling half of the server racks, while Super Micro, known for its liquid-cooling technology and strong ties with chip firms like Nvidia, will handle the other half. This collaboration was confirmed by Elon Musk on the social media platform X.

# Nvidia's Contribution

Nvidia is providing the advanced AI GPUs required for the project. The training of AI models like Grok requires tens of thousands of power-hungry chips. For instance, training the Grok 2 model took about 20,000 Nvidia H100 graphic processing units (GPUs), and future models will require even more. Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, emphasized the importance of this collaboration in expanding the reach of AI technology.

# The AI Factory

Dell CEO Michael Dell announced that the company is building an ""AI factory"" with Nvidia to power Grok. This AI factory will be a comprehensive infrastructure, including CPUs, GPUs, networking switches, software systems, and storage, all connected by miles of cables. The factory aims to make it easier for a broader range of customers to establish their own AI factories.

# Future Prospects

Elon Musk has ambitious plans for xAI. The supercomputer, termed the ""Gigafactory of Compute,"" is expected to be operational by fall 2025. This venture aims to enhance the capabilities of the Grok AI chatbot, making it a formidable competitor to existing AI models like OpenAI's ChatGPT. The project will utilize up to 100,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs, potentially making it one of the largest GPU clusters in existence.

# Conclusion

The collaboration between Dell, Super Micro, and Nvidia marks a significant milestone in the AI industry. By combining their expertise and resources, these companies are set to create a powerful supercomputer that will drive the next generation of AI technology. With the project expected to be completed by fall 2025, the future looks promising for xAI and its generative AI chatbot, Grok.

I think after this move on $SMCI we'll have to look for another play.

$SMCI has a tiny float that no one seems to understand from what I can tell. They also don’t have a large market cap just a high stock price due to their smaller float. 

$MU has earnings next week if it's good we can get a good move up like $NVDA had initially during the start of this crazy run.

$ARM has no history so people can be playing the upside future.

(Editor's Note: The list numbers got messed up and I can't fix it. Sorry.)

tl;dr: If you don't know me already, I'm about $400k+ in capital losses. 2024 YTD - I did well, I lost it all, and now I'm back to breakeven. Big mistakes can cripple an account. Not necessarily a theta-only strategy.

After some serious missteps, I'm back to slightly above breakeven for the year and I wanted to share a PSA on how not to be a freaking idiot like I am. See below for comments on each arrow.

Chapter 1 - ""Calendar Spreads"" - I love calendar spreads. I know people poop on them all the time, but for my mental state, they offer me the best return because I don't need to do too much thought on when to close. It's a Thelta™ strategy (Theta + Delta, no you can't have it I already trademarked it). They capitalize on WSB weekly plays while also offering you a reward for picking the correct direction on a stock as it moves upwards. Obviously, you also win if the stock is flat as the short leg loses value quicker than the long leg. You only lose if the stock rockets (bad case, but only if IV is flat or increasing) or plummets (worst case). At this point, MSTR and SMCI were going up insane amounts and the premiums were all insane. Also was using calendars on META and NFLX. Just started using calendars on post-split NVDA, pretty good so far.

My strategy is:

* Pick a stock I think we will go up
* Sell the weekly at strike price = current price + 3 to 5%
* Buy the quarterly at same strike (or after whenever next earnings occurs)
* If extrinsic value of weekly is ever 20% of extrinsic value of the value week's option, roll to following week.
* Chapter 2 - ""Red Numbers"" - At this point, I was up $50k for the year (\~140%) - As my portfolio size was increasing, so were my positions. My MSTR/SMCI calendars went from $13k each (1 spread) of net liquidity to $40k each (\~3 spreads). In retrospect, there is no reason to do this, just trying to exponentially capitalize what was working. I had about 75% of my port in MSTR and SMCI calendars, and they both tanked about 40% in 2 days. I sold for a loss because I got scared, but in retrospect I probably would have been okay if I held since they both recovered the following week. Nevertheless, still a bad play. See Chapter 4 for how I handle this.

1. Chapter 3 - ""Arbitrage is a Myth"" - I was discouraged and mad, so I didn't really do much trading for the next month. I had some good days and bad days, but stayed relatively flat. Then, big bad DJT came around and I thought,  ""wow these premiums are insane. I just found the best arbitrage opportunity"". It was some sort of short straddle with a short call, I dunno. Put premiums were high, call premiums were high, DJT is a scam, so how could I lose? Whatever it was, my bet was the DJT would go down, because duh. Nevertheless, the stock pushed through 60 like nothing, and because the liquidity on most of the options were abysmal, and I didn't want to have to borrow at 1,000% APY for a billion shares of DJT, I was closing my positions at awful fills and somehow managed to lose $25k on my DJT position (about 50%). For the following couple weeks I revenge traded a bunch of stuff and kept losing. Had some mental health issues, suicide watch (boring stuff don't worry about it), etc etc.
2. Chapter 4 - ""Rebirth"" - Early May I decided to go back to what was working and separate my remaining assets in two accounts. A ""buy and hold and maybe wheel"" account with Fidelity, and I kept my ""Calendar / Vertical"" account with the worst broker ever (Schwab). The former only has level 1 options and I sent a request to their support to prohibit me from going long any option position (so that I can only do CSP and CCs).

Doing this, I can allow the good companies to continue to grow without me watching them in my Fidelity portfolio. And by not watching them, I won't want to sell them prematurely like an idiot. Meanwhile, I can still get my dopamine fix by watching green and red lines all day long on my Schwab account. The biggest change I made was to remove any cash gained every week or so. I'm trying to keep my account at $30k at all times. Whenever I go up, I withdraw about 90% of what I 'won' so that I can't redeploy it, or I send it over to my Fidelity account. At this point, I have yet to go below $28k on the Schwab account, but I'll have to cross that bridge if it ever hits $25k. I know you people with 6/7 figure portfolios are scoffing at me right now, but I don't care.

72,SMCI,Officially up 100% since I started trading. Thanks theta gang,"The straightness of the line is the thing I’m most proud of. 2 years ago I didn’t know what an option was but I really committed to this. Paper traded for a while first and then dove in. I’ve had loads of great advice from the many sage elders of this page.

The thing I learned is you have to sell volitilty. Interactive brokers has a really good screener to find high IVR and high IVP stocks and ETFs. Nobody has any idea what the stock is gonna do, you just want to put the probabilities in your favour, make lots of trades with appropriate sizing. Options on futures is a must have weapon for any theta gangsters arsenal. You only have to cover variation margin so your gaining a lot of capital efficiency. About than half my gains came from futures. 

Cash secured puts are a massive waste of money. Too much collateral and not enough theta. Sell naked options and manage regularly. If I sell short a 50DTE put I’ll keep rolling it up if I get a positive move in the underlying. I like to keep my delta at about 0.25-0.3. If I sell short a 50DTE strangle on RTY or ES, I’ll roll in the untested side 4-10 times before I close at that golden 50% gain. Don’t let your delta exceed 0.15.

Buy bonds and Trae using the margin on the bonds. I believe long dated bonds are a buy with inflation coming down so put the majority of my initial investment into 2073 GBP Gilts. I bought at around 34% of the face value as the coupon in 1.125% (YTM is about 3.5%) You can margin 75% of “trusted” government bonds so I can still trade most of it. I expect to sell these in 2-3 years for about double when rates come down.

Most common positions:
1. Front Ratio spreads through earnings. Don’t be a pussy, none of that butterfly bullshit. Naked options through earnings are how you get hair on your chest. Buy at the expected move and sell a few strikes further out. Sometimes you can open for a credit and close for a credit which gives me a tingle in my balls.
2. Selling puts on commodity futures during raised IVR and upwards momentum mostly ZW, ZC, CG, SI and HG 45-60DTE and around 0.18-0.25 delta
3. Strangles on index futures during high IVR mostly ES and RTY, 45-60 DTE and around 0.25 deltas on each wing. I also do this on currency and bond futures.
4. Debit spreads on TSLA, NVDA, SMCI, COIN, etc. BTD on weekly calls. Buy ITM and sell so it’s a double or nothing play.
5. I nailed the bottom on the Chinease market. Leaps and shares on BABA and JD. Sold a lot of puts on BIDU but never assigned.
6. A few long share positions doing well: DE, PYPL, DG, TAN and NLR.
7. Calendar and diagonal spreads when there is high short term IV. Sell the 5-45DTE and buy the 90-120DTE
8. A month out from earnings, buy an ATM straddle for the expiration straight after earnings. As the IV builds, it makes the theta you pay cheaper. If the stock picks a direction and runs, you can 2-3x your position. If not close after a week or two for a small loss. I had big wins on TSLA and NVDA doing this.

22,SMCI,Dell surges 9% on optimism it has secured big AI server orders ,"Dell shares rose more than 9% on Wednesday to an all-time high after Morgan Stanley raised its price target and predicted that the company would rake in sales from the insatiable demand for artificial intelligence servers.

Dell is seeing accelerating momentum, especially in winning business to build AI servers, unlocking a new bull case for the stock, Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring wrote in a note on Wednesday. He upgraded his price target on Dell from $128 per share to $152 a share and called it a top pick.

“All-in, we are hearing about more AI server momentum at Dell than at any other OEM,” Woodring wrote, saying that he expected about $10 billion of AI server revenue in the company’s fiscal 2025 — ending next February.

Wednesday’s move was the largest since March 1, when the stock surged after earnings showed that the computer manufacturer has benefited from the AI boom.

Dell shares are now up over 95% in 2024, trailing the 220% gain from rival AI servermaker Super Micro Computer but surpassing Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s 5% gains this year.

Most AI servers are built around Nvidia’s chips, which have become prized in the technology industry because they are used to deploy advanced AI models from companies like Google, OpenAI and Meta. Dell sells servers using the newest Nvidia AI chips, including its H100 GPU and the latest Blackwell-generation chips.

At Nvidia’s annual conference in March, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang appeared to send customers who want the latest AI chips to Dell for orders.

“You’re going to need an AI factory,” Huang said. “And nobody is better at building end-to-end systems of very large scale for the enterprise than Dell.”

“Michael [Dell] is here and he’s happy to take your order,” Huang continued.

“While the near-exponential ramp of Nvidia GPU shipments and AI servers builds make it difficult to pin down exact growth rates,” Woodring wrote, he has confidence in Dell’s business for various reasons. Among those reasons are the strengthening demand for AI servers and that he models Dell’s market share increasing.

He wrote that Dell may be able to upsell its customers and “attach” additional hardware, such as data storage.

Dell is expected to announce its April quarter earnings on May 30. Nvidia reports earnings for its quarter ending in April on May 22.

Dell’s other business, building PCs for consumers and businesses running Microsoft Windows, could get a boost next week when Microsoft reveals new capabilities at its conference, including long-awaited AI features that many analysts expect to drive demand for new PCs.

PC sales have slumped for two years in a post-pandemic hangover, as consumers and enterprises who bought new machines during 2020 and 2021 pushed back the timeline for their next upgrades.

But the PC industry is on course to grow again and is outperforming lowered expectations, Woodring wrote, which will benefit Dell.

“We remain bullish on the PC market recovery as we are not only hearing about upgrade/refresh demand in our recent CIO and VAR checks, but also seeing upward revisions to notebook ODM builds in recent months,” Woodring wrote.

Monday's BP was 11.35k, Tuesday was 6.45k, Wednesday was 6.9k and Thursday was 8.45k so for four days the average BP for this week was 8.28k (8,287.50 to be exact). 

So that comes to **31.79% ROC**. If only this was reproducible every week 😆

**News worth mentioning:** We might have a geomagnetic storm that will affect electronics such as GPS, mobile phone networks, power grids, etc.

Fed also commented that inflation data has been disappointing and that it is too early to think about cutting rates- we might have 0 rate cuts this year.

US will impose tariffs on China EVs likely early next week. Worth watching NIO,BYD, TSLA, etc.

**SG-** Reports -.23 vs -.21 expected EPS, revenue is 157.9M vs 152M exp. Overall met expectations. However, they raised their guidance.

**AMD-** Possibly affected due to news about the rate cut- trading the most cleanly of all the semis for this news. (possibly also from the geomagnetic storm? Unlikely though)



**NVAX- Watching this for places to both go long and short above $11. News above.**

 

**GME-** We saw massive momentum Friday at the close, then again Monday in the morning. It hasn’t retraced the move for the last 5 days. Yesterday I thought it was worth keeping an eye on past $17, today I’m looking for places to play a short.

**SNAP-** Reports 0.03 vs -.05 expected, beat on Revenue and guides Q2 revenue above estimates. Also buoyed by the news that Bytedance bill was signed. Bytedance trying to sell without the TikTok algo technology which recommends videos.

**GOOG-** Reports Q1 EPS and Rev above estimates. Beats 1.89 vs 1.49 expected. Announces first ever quarterly dividend (20 cents) and additional share buyback of up to $70B.

**MSFT-** Guides Q4 Rev $63.5-64.5B  v $64.5Be; guides margins only very slightly down despite spending increasing.

**INTC-** Reports Q1 EPS and rev above estimates, beats .18 vs .13 expected. Revenue 12.7 vs 12.8B expected, guides Q2 below estimates.

**SKX-** Reports 1.37 vs 1.10expected, revenue is 2.25 vs 2.19B expected, raises FY24 outlook.

**Alset Capital Inc.** **(TSXV: KSUM)** released some game-changing news in early April, courtesy of its flagship subsidiary/investee, Cedarcross International Technologies Inc. Cedarcross won access to intermediate an acquisition between two AI (artificial intelligence) behemoths.

Most of us in the financial realm will have heard about these two famous and extremely important AI companies that Cedarcross is partnering with on this acquisition. Both are at the forefront of developing AI technology.

What is surprising is that one of these companies has a market value that just exceeds the market value of the entire Canadian economy!

One is **Super Micro Computer Inc. (NASDAQ: SMCI)**, and the other is the AI supernova, **Nvidia Corp.** **(NASDAQ: NVDA)**.

Alset Capital is engaged in the business of investing in technology companies, such as Cedarcross, which alone encompasses about 49% of Alset’s portfolio. Meanwhile, Cedarcross provides low-cost access to cutting-edge high performance computing hardware, fostering innovation and growth in the AI sector.

According to Cedarcross’s April 4 press release, *“This agreement grants Cedarcross the authority to engage directly with SMCI for the acquisition of GPU High Performance Computing (HPC) Hardware.” Cedarcross* provides the hardware that’s powering Nvidia’s most-advanced H100 computer chips.

Simply put, Altus Capital’s flagship AI company Cedarcross now has direct access to work with one of the biggest, most well-known AI leaders!

Technology giant Nvidia is hitting new heights thanks to demand for products connected to AI. Nvidia is worth about US$2.18 trillion, edging out the entire Canadian economy, as measured by GDP, at US$2.12 trillion in 2023, according to the International Monetary Fund. Interestingly, Supermicro’s modular server rack-scale systems are being used to mount AI-related graphics cards from Nvidia, as well as other chipmakers.

While Nvidia is massive, Super Micro Computer is no slouch. Not at all.

SMCI is a global technology leader committed to delivering first-to-market innovation for Enterprise, Cloud, AI, Metaverse, and 5G Telco/Edge IT Infrastructure. It is renowned for delivering one of the broadest selections of Nvidia-Certified systems providing the most performance and efficiency from small enterprises to massive, unified AI training clusters with the new Nvidia H100 and H200 Tensor Core GPUs (graphic processing units).

Greg Lui, CEO of Earthmade Computer Inc., a Super Micro Computer distributor, stated: *“This agreement is a testament to our commitment to providing HPC (high-performance computers) AI hardware solutions. By facilitating Cedarcross’s access to Nvidia’s GPU HPC hardware, we are not only strengthening our relationship with Alset and Cedarcross but also reinforcing our position in the AI computing supply chain. We look forward to the innovative advancements that Cedarcross will achieve with this high-performance computing power.”*

Alset Capital CEO, Morgan Good, was quoted as saying: *“We are very enthusiastic about Cedarcross’s strategic collaboration with Earthmade to purchase Nvidia HPC hardware directly from Super Micro Computer. This agreement not only ensures the seamless procurement of vital AI computing hardware but also solidifies Cedarcross’s competitive positioning in the industry.”*

With a US$59.13 billion market cap, SMCI is “one of the leaders in the current AI revolution,” according to *Motley Fool*. The renowned financial news publication released an article on April 3 asking, “*Could Super Micro Computer Become the Next Nvidia?”*

As for Alset Capital and its shareholders (who have a great deal to gain from this proposed acquisition between NVDA and SMCI), we are already seeing green indicators for its stock KSUM. And now multiple technical analysis websites are listing KSUM as “Strong Green”.

Well, a Nasdaq article says that the next stocks that could follow a similar path are this ones: 

- Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)
- Palantir Technologies (PLTR)
- Super Micro Computer (SMCI)

Tbh they all seem like they could be shorted and that gains would arrive soon, at least in the next month.

But what are your thoughts? Are they worth shorthing, just like DJT is?

Hi! I am an ex-prop trader that trades equities.

This is a daily watchlist for trading. I might trade all of the stocks on here, or none of them, on any given day. I might trade stocks that don't appear on here! I hold no positions in any stocks long-term but Amazon/Mag7/general broad market indices. (unless otherwise noted in these tickers). If you’re on old reddit, click “show images” at the top to see all the charts quickly.

I usually make these watchlists premarket, (or from 6:30 to 7 as time permits), but can be delayed if I'm trading the open. These aren't mean to be taken as gospel or any recommendation to buy/sell. Many stocks I post are &lt;$500M market cap. Most are NOT good long-term investments but are good candidates to day trade. If you have questions to ask, PLEASE ask specific ones. Questions like “Thoughts on \_\_\_\_\_? will be ignored unless you add detail to the question”.

The Company is intriguing in two main areas, first as a proxy for the AI sector—rapidly growing, as you may have noticed—and exposure to the cutting-edge products of NVIDIA—which, while primarily known for gaming products, is moving into the almost USD5t (yes, trillion) healthcare market.

**NDVA** was one of the 'Magnificent Seven' dubbed as such when each delivered an average gain of 112% last year, which crushed the 24% return of the S&amp;P 500 index.

Alset has two primary investment arms: Cedarcross International Technologies Inc. (“Cedarcross"") (49% Ownership). Cedarcross’ mission is to democratize access to high-performance AI computing.

By offering access to the world’s fastest AI servers, powered by NVIDIA’s H100 HGX Servers, Cedarcross empowers enterprises with unparalleled computing capabilities, exceeding 700,000 hours.

The NVIDIA HGX B200 and HGX B100 integrate NVIDIA Blackwell Tensor Core GPUs with high-speed interconnects to propel the data center into a new era of accelerating computing and generative AI. Blackwell-based HGX systems are designed for the most demanding generative AI, data analytics, and HPC workloads.

These companies personify the latest tech, understanding must be more complex. In essence, **KSUM is directly in the huge AI sandbox with NVDA and SuperMicro.** KSUM capitalized at 18 million, and the others at 2.1 trillion and 60 billion, respectively.

It was Motley Fool. Yes, I have known them since they were two guys. Super Micro could be the next NVDA. To the moon, Norton.

While Alset is lunch money compared to its extensive peers, they could get bitten off if the big boys need it. I have always thought—not concluded—that two of these behemoths may merge.

Either eventuality is a win for KSUM.

And it’s investors.

The agreement grants Cedarcross the authority to engage directly with Super Micro Computer, Inc.(NASDAQ: SMCI) to acquire Nvidia GPU High Performance Computing (HPC) Hardware.

These companies personify the latest tech, understanding must be more complex. In essence, **KSUM is directly in the huge AI sandbox with NVDA and SuperMicro.** KSUM capitalized at 18 million, and the others at 2.1 trillion and 60 billion, respectively.

It was Motley Fool. Yes, I have known them since they were two guys. Super Micro could be the next NVDA. To the moon, Norton.

While Alset is lunch money compared to its extensive peers, they could get bitten off if the big boys need it. I have always thought—not concluded—that two of these behemoths may merge.

Either eventuality is a win for KSUM.

And it’s investors.

Hi! I am an ex-prop trader that trades equities.

This is a daily watchlist for trading. I might trade all of the stocks on here, or none of them, on any given day. I might trade stocks that don't appear on here! I hold no positions in any stocks long-term but Amazon/Mag7/general broad market indices. (unless otherwise noted in these tickers).

I usually make these watchlists premarket, (or from 6:30 to 7 as time permits), but can be delayed if I'm trading the open. These aren't mean to be taken as gospel or any recommendation to buy/sell. Many stocks I post are &lt;$500M market cap. Most are NOT good long-term investments but are good candidates to day trade. If you have questions to ask, PLEASE ask specific ones.

Hi! I am an ex-prop trader that trades equities.

  
This is a daily watchlist for trading. I might trade all of the stocks on here, or none of them, on any given day. I might trade stocks that don't appear on here! I hold no positions in any stocks long-term but Amazon/Mag7/general broad market indices. (unless otherwise noted in these tickers).

  
I usually make these watchlists premarket, (or from 6:30 to 7 as time permits), but can be delayed if I'm trading the open. These aren't mean to be taken as gospel or any recommendation to buy/sell. Many stocks I post are &lt;$500M market cap. Most are NOT good long-term investments but are good candidates to day trade. If you have questions to ask, PLEASE ask specific ones. Questions like “Thoughts on \_\_\_\_?” will be ignored.

This is a daily watchlist. I might trade all of the stocks on here, or none of them, on any given day. I might trade stocks that don't appear on here! I hold no positions in any stocks long-term but Amazon/Mag7/general broad market indices. (unless otherwise noted in these tickers).

I usually make these watchlists premarket, (or from 6:30 to 7 as time permits), but can be delayed if I'm trading the open. These aren't mean to be taken as gospel or any recommendation to buy/sell.

I'm really confused and can not understand what is the reason for success of Super Micro Computer Stock - MS5 the last two years. What is the fundament for that? People say: it can benefit from growing AI market and sell more AI servers. Well, but when I take a look at their servers, they are not special or not having some critical advantage over servers from HP, Dell, or Lenovo. They just buy or license HGX baseboard and buy SXM GPU modules from NVDIA and put them together which other server manufactures can do as well.

33,SMCI,"Why is gold at an all-time high, while gold miners' stocks are at the bottom?","The answer is simple - costs are rising faster than revenue. Let's look at Barrick Gold Corp.:

2016: All-in Sustaining Costs ($/oz) – 674, Realized Price ($/oz) – 1248. 2023: All-in Sustaining Costs ($/oz) – 1335 (approx. x2), Realized Price ($/oz) – 1948 (approx. x1.5).

As a result, gold prices increase, but miners' EPS doesn't see the same rise.

However, in the next year or two, the rise in gold prices could accelerate. It's already happening, even though rates have yet to be cut.

We might see a repeat of the 2020-21 story - gold reaching new levels with a sharp increase in free cash flow and EPS for miners.

122,SMCI,SMCI - My BEAR case,"I have been hearing a lot of buzz around SMCI lately and there is a lot of chatter about it being put into the S&amp;P at the next rebalance (snapshot date is this upcoming Friday, 08 March 2024 and implement date is the following Friday after close I believe.)

&amp;#x200B;

I am going to make my bear case for this stock by not looking at fundamentals at all and only using basic rebalance principles.  Since the vast majority of Americans have their money passively flowing into these broad indices and not caring about the specific underlying stocks anyways, I think it is only fitting to remove fundamental company analysis entirely.

&amp;#x200B;

As it stands, SMCI is trading at $905.48 and has a market cap of $50.65 billion USD.  
  
Currently, SMCI is trading in the Russell 2000 (RUT). It is the highest cap stock in the RUT by about 3x. This disparity is why I believe that joining the S&amp;P 500 is a death sentence to the stock price, and the downwards pressure and volatility will happen extremely quickly once it is added. I will explain why.  
  
The majority of investors nowadays invest their money passively through retirement accounts/401k's or just are told that their money is safer if you put it into ETFs. This results in a MASSIVE amount of inflow into a basket of stocks without much/any DD discerning the individual stocks in the basket. As for market cap weighted indices/ETFs, the percentage of that index is based on the market cap of the stock.  
  
If I put $1,000 into the RUT, as it currently stands, $1.62 of that will be towards SMCI, while the next highest stock, MSTR, will receive $0.51. As SMCI increases in market cap, even more of the inflow into the RUT will get pumped passively into SMCI. This is a self-perpetuating cycle of inflow into the highest capped stock(s) in the index.  
  
Now onto the S&amp;P 500. I am going to compare SMCI to 3M, which has a market cap of $50.77 billion and is currently sitting in the S&amp;P 500. 3M is weighted to 0.12% of the entire S&amp;P, meaning it receives approximately 0.12% of the inflow. If SMCI enters into the S&amp;P, I expect it to receive about the same, 0.12% inflow. Now looking at the daily volume of SPY (S&amp;P ETF) vs IWM (RUT ETF), there is about 5.5x the flow of SPY vs. IWM, meaning SPY gets 5.5x more money going through it daily.  
  
Doing some quick math off this, SMCI is currently sitting at an inflow of 1.62%(IWM) and will turn into 0.12%(SPY). Turning the units of SPY into IWM, we multiply the 0.12 by 5.5, so 0.12%(SPY)\*5.5(SPY)/(IWM) nets us 0.65%(IWM).  
  
The ratio of inflow into SMCI immediately after it enters the S&amp;P will be 0.65/1.62\*100 = 40% of what it is currently getting while outperforming in the RUT.  
  
This tells me that the inflow into SMCI is going to take a 60% decline overnight as soon as it gets put into the S&amp;P. Obviously there are other factors and the RUT is not the only ETF or fund trading SMCI right now, but the underlying argument still stands that the inflow is going to be GREATLY reduced instantaneously, likely causing a massive shock to the stock price.  
  
This same calculation can be used on other over or underperforming stocks in their indices if they are set to jump from one index to another.

&amp;#x200B;

Feel free to argue me on this one if you disagree with me!",26,33,1709501816.0,2024-03-03T21:36:56+00:00,t3_1b5st7x,stocks,"SMCI - My BEAR case I have been hearing a lot of buzz around SMCI lately and there is a lot of chatter about it being put into the S&amp;P at the next rebalance (snapshot date is this upcoming Friday, 08 March 2024 and implement date is the following Friday after close I believe.)

34,SMCI,ETF rebalancing is upon us. Let's talk about what that means for over or under performers!,"I have been hearing a lot of buzz around a couple of stocks, namely SMCI and NVDA.  I want to discuss what I believe is going to happen in the next two weeks if SMCI lands into the S&amp;P 500 as it is on track to do.

I will mainly discuss SMCI in this post.  As it stands, SMCI is trading at $905.48 and has a market cap of $50.65 billion USD.

Currently, SMCI is trading in the Russell 2000 (RUT).  It is the highest cap stock in the RUT by about 300%.

75,SMCI,Please share your suggestions on AVGO naked calls,"Final Edit: Closed all positions (both long and short calls) for 15K loss on 3/4 market open, thanks all for your suggestions ..

\--------------------------------------

I had 23 credit spreads for AVGO 3/8 1620-1660 strikes, which I opened last week. On 2/29, I closed the 1660 long legs (foolishly) as they were losing premium. The plan was to exit all positions before the earnings report.

Now I am stuck with 23 naked 1620 calls and 7 long1660 calls, experiencing a 13K paper loss. I did not expect AVGO to make a 100 move on Friday alone, and didn't put stop loss.

On Friday, I opened 2 debit call spreads (1550-1600) as a hedge.

Given the ER next week, how do you suggest I handle this situation?

Option 1: Roll the naked 3/8 1620 calls to 3/15 1700 calls and wait or continue rolling them until I exit the position.

Option 2: Take a loss on some of the naked calls (say, 10) and buy more hedges (buy debit call spreads 1550-1600). And hope AVGO will not got there.

Option 3: Take the loss and wait for a better entry point.

Please share your suggestions on what you would do in this situation.

(In the past two years, I made 150K in profits by selling credit spreads with a 500K account. However, in 2024, I have lost 90K on NVDA/SMCI crazy moves and have been struggling to think clearly since then. I know, I should not have attempted this trade at all.)

Hey,
I gotta admit, I made a rookie mistake yesterday. Sold $SMCI 930 call with zero days to expiration for 20$, only to watch it skyrocket to 1020 after hours. Panic mode set in, and I scrambled to buy 88 shares (wanted 100 to have full cover but 88 was my max allowed) at 934 after hours to cover my short call position.

Fast forward to today, the option expired worthless (wattt), but I'm still holding onto those 88 shares. Now, I'm sweating bullets, wondering if $SMCI will tank to 850 or below at the open. It's like playing Russian roulette with this stock, even with its S&amp;P 500 inclusion.

What are your thoughts? Any advice on how to navigate this mess?

&gt; Revenue came in at $22.1 billion, up from $6.05 billion a year before, while analysts had been modeling $20.4 billion.

&gt; Data-center revenue at Nvidia NVDA rocketed more than 400% from a year before to hit $18.4 billion, while the FactSet consensus was for $17.06 billion.

&gt; Nvidia forecasts continued strong growth for the ongoing quarter, well above expectations. The company is calling for $24.0 billion in revenue, up from $7.2 billion a year prior, while analysts were modeling $22.2 billion.

&gt; Accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point,” Chief Executive Jensen Huang said in a release. “Demand is surging worldwide across companies, industries and nations.”

&gt; Nvidia posted fiscal fourth-quarter net income of $12.3 billion, or $4.93 a share, compared with $1.4 billion, or 57 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. On an adjusted basis, the company earned $5.16 a share, while analysts were projecting $4.59 a share.

I own Nvidia, so I admit, I am biased. But I think anyway you slice those numbers, they’re pretty damn impressive. If it’s a bubble, it’s a bubble that people are buying into. And by people, I mean, giant, multinational companies. It’s amazing growth for a company so large. 

I’m hoping this brings some calm back to the markets. We’ve been pivoting between irrational exuberance and panic.

**EDIT**: it is the next day, and the results are in. My personal account earned 27.9% TODAY. That is from 2 NVDA options and 1 SMCI option. My larger retirement account made 11.2% today based on NVDA stock SMCI stock NVDA option and lots of ETFs. Probably no one will see this edit. But as a normal investor, the reason I’m in this space is because of these returns. The reason a lot of people are here are because of these returns.

News: Capital One to Buy Discover for $35 Billion in Year's Biggest Deal

  
SMCI- Hit that $1000, broke it, then utterly collapsed. I was out of town Friday, but this was probably the best trade of the year. Worth watching for any additional moves down, but other than that I’m going to be hands-off.

  
NVDA- Failed to break that $750 that I was interested in (highest we got was $745), and sold off at the open. For me, this is a hands-off until the earnings report. Looks like the semis/AI run-up might be over unless they report a blow-out earnings.

  
DFS- Capital One confirms that they are going to acquire DFS in all-stock transaction ($35.3B)

  
RAPT- Clinical hold placed on their asthma drug, stock is down 63% from the open. Worth watching to see if we break that $10 level for a multi-day swing trade. 

  
SSRM- Reports that employees are being charged due to mine collapse in Turkey (this happened last week). Would keep on watchlist because this doesn’t seem like something that is going to be resolved within a day (like PCG, the Hawaii fires, Rio Tinto, etc).

265,SMCI,"Full-ported 1060c on SCMI, down 18k. Anyone else find out they were mentally challenged yesterday?","An old man told his grandson, “My son, there is an endless battle that goes on inside all of us. It is between two wolves. One wolf is bad – he is degenerate gambling, meme stocks, full-porting on 200% IV, and 0DTE. The other is good – he is joy, peace, love, hope, serenity, and putting your elected amount into your company-sponsored 401k and ignoring the fucking stock market.”

The grandson thought about it and then asked his grandfather, “Which wolf will win?”

The old man answered, “The one you feed.”

As the title says, I have an account that I built up from 3k to 28k over the past year. Always following good trading practices - small position size, trying to make sure it was a good entry, taking profits on my winners and letting free-runners ride with S/L in the green while cutting losers before they get too big. 

Friday morning I woke up and chose degenerate gambling. Bought SMCI 3/1 1060c at about $134.40, watched it drop to about $74.00 and thought, Sick half off! And bought myself a second. Then it hit about $48.40 and I was like Fire Sale! 🔥 🔥 🔥 and got myself another. 

Now I’m sitting with $18k loss, looking at starting over from scratch.Or maybe god loves me and wants me to have a lamborghini.

125,SMCI,2024 One Month Reflection,"Coming into 2024 there were hopes of six rate cuts.  Institutions started positioning themselves into small caps in November and December thinking the rate cuts will drive small caps.  Tech had such a great year last year, but most of the gains were from losses in 2022.

Based on chairman Powell's remarks yesterday it is unlikely we see a rate cut in march.  That is when we started to see another selloff.  Besides the rate cuts probably not happening until May their is also risk in the regional banking sector when they start realizing the losses in commercial real estate. 

There is also instability in the Middle East which is affecting shipping.  Oil prices have not gone up yet due to this conflict.  As long as the conflict is contained and does not start to grow I don't see this being a big issue.  

Tech earnings started to come in and it has been a mixed bag so far.  SMCI is showing great strength from the AI boom.  AMD's Lisa SU said,“We are in the very early stages of the AI computing era, and the rate of adoption and growth is faster than any other technology in recent history”  Microsoft reported 30% growth in Azure revenue.

Based on this information the broader market should start to  do better around April leading into the May Fed meeting.  There is risk if we don't see the rate cuts in May which are not guaranteed.  I would stay out of the regional banks even if their are cuts due to the commercial real estate risk.  Hopefully this will not bleed over to ther areas of the economy.   Lastly I think tech will continue to outperform for at least a few years due to the early AI cycle.  This is going to lead to PC sales, data center, and cellular phone sales, to name a few that will see growth due to everyone upgrading for the AI technology.  Growth in the income will start to then reflect in the stocks.

Today's screener data. In first column, we have sets of 3 rows that have Level 1, Level 2, and Data Since labels. The Data Since rows describe the date at which valid data is available for its computations.

Next are the rows for Level 1 and Level 2. Let's look at Level 1 first. In the rows for Level 1, a number greater than or equal to 1 indicates that on a price change % versus time basis, the symbol is overbought because it moved farther to the upside and faster than 99% of all other equivalent time periods in its history. These cells are highlighted light blue in the screener data file.

In the rows for Level 1, a number less or equal to zero indicates that on a price change % versus time basis, the symbol is oversold because it moved farther to the downside and faster than 99% of all other equivalent time periods in its history. These cells are highlighted light red in the screener data file.

Level 2 is similar to Level 1 except that instead of 99% of the history, it is 100% of the history implying the stock/ETF/index has never moved that far that fast for any equivalent period of time in my data set. Yellow highlighted cells simply highlight symbols that are near overbought or oversold on a Level 1 or Level 2 basis.",0.03503336384892464,0.06240018457174301,0.9025664925575256,neutral,0.9025664925575256,-0.027366820722818375

Super Micro Computer ($SMCI) has carved out a very attractive niche for itself within the AI industry, and the stock has climbed 163% in 2023. But what's even more impressive is that, unlike some other tech stocks that were down in 2022, Super Micro is achieving these gains after rising nearly 87% last year -- and remember, that was in a year in which the Nasdaq Composite (\^IXIC) fell more than 30%!  
Although the stock has nearly quintupled in a mere 18 months, one Wall Street analyst recently upgraded Super Micro while raising her price target to $325 -- about 50% higher than shares sit today.  
That may seem laughable to some, but unlike some other AI plays that seem extremely expensive, there's a perfectly reasonable case for Super Micro to reach that target and even surpass it.

**Loop Capital is all in on SMCI's ""Legos""**  
On June 14, research firm Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah raised her price target on Super Micro Computer from $200 per share to $325, indicating a roughly 50% gain from the stock's current level.  
In her note, Baruah said Loop's work suggests that ""the Gen AI compute build has both legs and commercial commitment, with Gen AI going to 30%-40% of all Hyperscale applications from less than 5% today."" Within the generative AI megatrend, Baruah especially likes Super Micro Computer because of its unique ""complexity at scale"" building block model, which Baruah believes has at least a 12- to 24-month lead over the competition.

What is the building block business model? At a recent conference hosted by Rosenblatt Securities, Super Micro founder Charles Liang describes the strategy of building servers as if by ""Legos,"" with each component optimized for quality, functionality, cost, and integration, which can be formed into a myriad of customized server designs.   
  
As opposed to other server companies that mass-produce standard models, customers can optimize Super Micro's server systems based on the end application. And with the proliferation of not just artificial intelligence but also 5G, edge computing, and the Internet of Things, customers appear to be hungry for customized solutions that can be delivered quickly at scale.  
In fact, Loop had mentioned this large-scale customization advantage in its previous note on May 24, when it had initially raised its price target on Super Micro to $200 from $150. In that note, Baruah said that while AI is the most important and prominent catalyst, ""Super Micro's core value-add is deep server customization providing a differentiated impact for increasingly strategic applications, including AI/ML \[machine learning\], Data Analytics, Strategic Video Streaming, etc.""

**And don't forget the advantages of green computing**  
Loop isn't the only research firm that's bullish on Super Micro's prospects from here, either. Earlier in June, Rosenblatt Securities' Hans Mosesmann initiated coverage on the company with a $300 price target, implying about 40% upside from current levels.  
Mosesmann also noted the mass-customized building block model but is also bullish on Super Micro's ""green computing"" ethos, whereby the company touts its servers as the most energy-efficient in the industry. While ""green computing"" used to be a nice-to-have feature, in the world of AI, it's much more important. Leading-edge chips require tremendous amounts of electricity to run and also generate large amounts of heat, which requires some way to cool the chips. Since cooling systems require space and electricity in and of themselves, this increases the electricity and square footage needs of AI data centers even further.  
Mosesmann wrote in his June note that Super Micro's new liquid cooling technology can increase rack compute power by over two times, which Mosesmann describes as ""a disruptive dynamic in a power constrained data center.""  
So while Super Micro isn't in the business of designing highly specialized proprietary semiconductors, its novel server architecture also contributes to increasing the computing power of AI data centers, albeit by more indirect means.

**A plausible path to $325**  
Even after quintupling, Super Micro trades at only around 20 times earnings, and those earnings incorporate a weak non-AI server market, as well as supply constraints for AI chips that limited Super Micro's growth last quarter.

Analysts have consistently underestimated Super Micro's growth over the past few years and are still only forecasting modest earnings growth in the year ahead for some reason. Yet Charles Liang sees the company growing ""at least"" 20% in the upcoming fiscal year, starting July 1.  
If Super Micro can maintain a 20% earnings growth rate over the next few years, that would amount to a PEG ratio of just 1. That's actually fair or even cheap for a technology stock, which means Loop's $325 target is certainly attainable in the year ahead.

# [Dow futures fall as traders await the Federal Reserve’s latest rate hike decision](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/31/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures slipped Wednesday as investors looked ahead to the Federal Reserve’s Wednesday meeting.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow shed 116 points, or 0.3%. S&amp;P 500 futures were down 0.2%, while Nasdaq-100 futures gained 0.1%.
*****
&gt; The Fed at 2 p.m. ET will announce how much it is increasing interest rates in its latest effort to tame high inflation. Markets are expecting a 25 basis point, or 0.25 percentage point, bump from the central bank. On Tuesday, the employment cost index, a measure of wage increases, showed compensation rose 1% in the fourth quarter, less than the 1.1% estimate by Dow Jones. The Fed’s announcement will be followed by comments from Chair Jerome Powell.
*****
&gt; Still, traders may be getting ahead of themselves in expecting a more dovish tone from the Fed, or looking for signs that a pause in hikes or even a pivot is coming soon.
*****
&gt; The Fed’s message Wednesday “will push back against the pivot narrative and thereby current bond market pricing,” wrote DoubleLine’s Jeffrey Gundlach in a tweet. “Should be interesting.”
*****
&gt; Wall Street is coming off a strong session to end January. The Dow ended Tuesday nearly 369 points higher, rising by 1.09%. The S&amp;P 500 gained 1.46% to cap its best January performance since 2019. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 1.67%, notching its best January performance in 22 years.
*****
&gt; Earnings season continues as well. Peloton and Meta Platforms are scheduled to report quarterly results on Wednesday.
*****
&gt; Snap shares dropped more than 15% after the social media company posted a disappointing quarterly revenue. The company’s average revenue per user, a key metric for Snap, also came in below expectations. Meanwhile, AMD reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue but warned of a 10% top-line decline in the first quarter.

# [Dow futures fall as traders await the Federal Reserve’s latest rate hike decision](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/31/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures slipped Wednesday as investors looked ahead to the Federal Reserve’s Wednesday meeting.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow shed 116 points, or 0.3%. S&amp;P 500 futures were down 0.2%, while Nasdaq-100 futures gained 0.1%.
*****
&gt; The Fed at 2 p.m. ET will announce how much it is increasing interest rates in its latest effort to tame high inflation. Markets are expecting a 25 basis point, or 0.25 percentage point, bump from the central bank. On Tuesday, the employment cost index, a measure of wage increases, showed compensation rose 1% in the fourth quarter, less than the 1.1% estimate by Dow Jones. The Fed’s announcement will be followed by comments from Chair Jerome Powell.
*****
&gt; Still, traders may be getting ahead of themselves in expecting a more dovish tone from the Fed, or looking for signs that a pause in hikes or even a pivot is coming soon.
*****
&gt; The Fed’s message Wednesday “will push back against the pivot narrative and thereby current bond market pricing,” wrote DoubleLine’s Jeffrey Gundlach in a tweet. “Should be interesting.”
*****
&gt; Wall Street is coming off a strong session to end January. The Dow ended Tuesday nearly 369 points higher, rising by 1.09%. The S&amp;P 500 gained 1.46% to cap its best January performance since 2019. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 1.67%, notching its best January performance in 22 years.
*****
&gt; Earnings season continues as well. Peloton and Meta Platforms are scheduled to report quarterly results on Wednesday.
*****
&gt; Snap shares dropped more than 15% after the social media company posted a disappointing quarterly revenue. The company’s average revenue per user, a key metric for Snap, also came in below expectations. Meanwhile, AMD reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue but warned of a 10% top-line decline in the first quarter.

# [Stock futures fall on Tuesday, but S&amp;P 500 headed for best January since 2019](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/30/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures declined Tuesday as traders wrap up what has been a strong month for equities.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the S&amp;P 500 dipped 0.3%, while futures connected to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 0.4%, or 119 points. Nasdaq-100 futures dropped 0.5%.
*****
&gt; Caterpillar shares fell more than 2% in the premarket after the industrial giant posted its latest quarterly results. Meanwhile, General Motors shares jumped more than 4% in premarket trading after reporting strong earnings.
*****
&gt; Those moves build on Monday’s declines. The Dow lost 0.8% in the previous session, while the S&amp;P and Nasdaq Composite fell 1.30% and 1.96%, respectively.
*****
&gt; It’s been a stellar January for stocks, otherwise. As of Monday’s close, the S&amp;P 500 and Dow are up 4.64% and 1.72% in January, respectively, and headed for their third positive month in four. The S&amp;P 500 is also on track for its best January since 2019. The Nasdaq Composite has risen 8.86% this month, putting it on pace for its best monthly performance since July.
*****
&gt; “The reason I’ve been optimistic on equities to start the year is because revisions are mostly behind us, people got too negative,” Trivariate Research’s Adam Parker told CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime” on Monday.
*****
&gt; A solid January could be a good sign for the market, and potentially foreshadow a continued uptick in the months that follow. Of the five instances in which the S&amp;P gained more than 5% in January after a negative year, the benchmark index rose 30% for the year on average, said Carson Group’s Ryan Detrick in a tweet.
*****
&gt; However, a busy week of earnings could put this recent rally in jeopardy. Investors are watching closely for comments on how some of the largest companies are faring amid high inflation and fears of slowing consumer spending.
*****
&gt; Attention also turns to the latest interest rate decision due out of the Federal Reserve’s latest policy meeting kicking off Tuesday. Traders widely expect a 25 basis point increase, but will monitor commentary for clues into how much further the Fed intends to hike, or when it plans to cut rates.

# [Stock futures fall on Tuesday, but S&amp;P 500 headed for best January since 2019](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/30/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures declined Tuesday as traders wrap up what has been a strong month for equities.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the S&amp;P 500 dipped 0.3%, while futures connected to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 0.4%, or 119 points. Nasdaq-100 futures dropped 0.5%.
*****
&gt; Caterpillar shares fell more than 2% in the premarket after the industrial giant posted its latest quarterly results. Meanwhile, General Motors shares jumped more than 4% in premarket trading after reporting strong earnings.
*****
&gt; Those moves build on Monday’s declines. The Dow lost 0.8% in the previous session, while the S&amp;P and Nasdaq Composite fell 1.30% and 1.96%, respectively.
*****
&gt; It’s been a stellar January for stocks, otherwise. As of Monday’s close, the S&amp;P 500 and Dow are up 4.64% and 1.72% in January, respectively, and headed for their third positive month in four. The S&amp;P 500 is also on track for its best January since 2019. The Nasdaq Composite has risen 8.86% this month, putting it on pace for its best monthly performance since July.
*****
&gt; “The reason I’ve been optimistic on equities to start the year is because revisions are mostly behind us, people got too negative,” Trivariate Research’s Adam Parker told CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime” on Monday.
*****
&gt; A solid January could be a good sign for the market, and potentially foreshadow a continued uptick in the months that follow. Of the five instances in which the S&amp;P gained more than 5% in January after a negative year, the benchmark index rose 30% for the year on average, said Carson Group’s Ryan Detrick in a tweet.
*****
&gt; However, a busy week of earnings could put this recent rally in jeopardy. Investors are watching closely for comments on how some of the largest companies are faring amid high inflation and fears of slowing consumer spending.
*****
&gt; Attention also turns to the latest interest rate decision due out of the Federal Reserve’s latest policy meeting kicking off Tuesday. Traders widely expect a 25 basis point increase, but will monitor commentary for clues into how much further the Fed intends to hike, or when it plans to cut rates.

&gt; Investors weighed more economic data Friday ahead of next week’s Federal Reserve policy meeting. The personal consumption expenditures price index, excluding energy and food, showed prices rose 4.4% from a year ago, the Commerce Department said, and in line with the Dow Jones estimate. So-called PCE is a preferred inflation gauge for the Fed.
*****
&gt; A better-than-expected fourth-quarter gross domestic product report Thursday also helped stoke hopes that the Fed may manage a soft landing.
*****
&gt; These are some of the last data points before the central bank’s widely expected 25 basis point hike.

&gt; # February Better In Pre-Election Years

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/c4eff32afed2c42603d8164cc899a4ae/3bfc0b06e3404977-44/s500x750/9bac22e482016defabc13bb218e026a0adc0ad57.jpg))**

&gt; Normally the “weak link” of the Best Months, February has been stronger in pre-election years, #5 for DJIA and NASDAQ; #6 for S&amp;P 500 and #4 for Russell 2000. Average gains range from 1.2% by S&amp;P 500 to 2.8% from NASDAQ. Benefitting from January Effect spillover, Russell 2000 averages 2.7% in pre-election Februarys.

&gt; The first trading day of February is bullish for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and 2000. Average gains on the first day over the most recent 21-year period range from 0.39% by DJIA to 0.65% by Russell 2000. However, after a strong opening day, strength has tended to fade until around the fourth trading day. From there until around the 12-trading day all five indexes have historically enjoyed gains. But those gains have not held through the end of February.

&gt; Pre-election-year Februarys going back to 1950 for DJIA and S&amp;P 500, 1971 for NASDAQ and 1979 for Russell 1000 &amp; 2000, exhibit a similar pattern, but the gains have held through the end of the month.

***** 

&gt; # February 2023 Almanac: Historically Solid Gains in Pre-Election Years

&gt; Although February is right in the middle of the Best Six Months, its long-term track record, since 1950, is rather tepid. February ranks no better than sixth and has posted meager average gains except for the Russell 2000. Small cap stocks, benefiting from “January Effect” carry over; historically tend to outpace large cap stocks in February. The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks turns in an average gain of 1.1% in February since 1979—just the sixth best month for that benchmark. Even with the market struggling the past two trading sessions Russell 2000 has maintained a performance lead this January compared to DJIA and S&amp;P 500. This does bode well for the continued outperformance in February by small-cap stocks.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/f47b8e6da59ed858c0949fa14963b2c3/4b58250e91bb3fd3-0d/s400x600/46f1ee1b2a8bb592f7110d2cbae1a4491f738996.jpg))**

&gt; In pre-election years, February’s performance generally improves with average returns all turning positive. NASDAQ performs best, gaining an average 2.8% in pre-election-year Februarys since 1971. Russell 2000 is second best, averaging gains of 2.7% since 1979. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000, the large-cap indices, tend to lag with average advances ranging from 1.2% to 1.7%.

&gt; # 5 Things To Know About Recessions And Bear Markets

&gt; “I am an optimist because I don’t see the point in being anything else.” Abraham Lincoln

&gt; With all the talk about a pending recession and stocks in a bear market, today, I wanted to share some more thoughts and stats on recessions and bear markets.

&gt; First things first, we do not currently anticipate a recession in 2023, which is quite opposite of the general consensus. You can read more about that here and here.

&gt; What exactly is a bear market? For the definition of a bear market, we are using the traditional definition, which is an index down 20% or more from the recent peak. Yes, there isn’t much difference between 19.8% and 20.0%, so we will also include some near bear markets as well, but when we say bear market, that is what we mean.

&gt; First, do all bear markets take place in a recession? Turns out they don’t, as stocks, indeed can have a bear market without a recession. The worst ever was the 34% bear during the Crash of 1987, which all took place without a recession.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog-197-800x595.png))**

&gt; Second, taking things a step further, here we broke down the performance based on if the bear market took place in a recession or not. Take note; we did include some ‘near bear markets’ this time to get more instances. Plus, a near bear feels like a bear market if you are in it. What still amazes us about the table below is that the average bear market without a recession was 24%, and this recent bear was 25%. Assuming we avoid a recession and October was indeed low, this was right on the bullseye.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/blog-264-800x361.png))**

&gt; Now take another look at the table above. The last few bear markets recovered quite quickly. In fact, the last three bear markets that didn’t have a recession recovered in four, four, and three months. Something to think about here, as stocks are two months off the October lows.

&gt; Third, this has been making the rounds lately and has been adding to some of the worries. Looking at all the bear markets that took place around a recession, not once did the bear market end before the recession started. In other words, if we are indeed headed for a recession in 2023, this could suggest that new lows may also be quite likely. Incredibly, bears don’t end for another nine months on average after the recession started, before they find their ultimate low. Again, we don’t see a recession, so this wouldn’t be the case now, but the data is quite compelling.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BearMarketEnds-800x332.png))**

&gt; Fourth, the month of October tends to be a bear-market killer. Most bears have met their end during the month of October, more than any other month.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/OctoberEnds-800x338.png))**

&gt; Below, we break down those previous 17 bear (or near bear) markets. The bottom line six of them ended in October, and we think there’s a very good chance number seven just happened.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/blog-632-800x455.png))**

&gt; Fifth and lastly, if October was indeed the bear market low, be open to the idea of higher prices over the coming two years. While not a predictor of future behavior, history shows the markets were up more than 40% a year off of the bear-market lows and up almost 60% two years off of them. During uncertain and volatile situations (like the ones that markets have treated us to in 2022), it can be hard to imagine a positive path forward, and all we see are the obstacles. Stepping back a bit can be a helpful reminder of the resiliency of the markets over the long term.

&gt; Dr. Seuss said, “Sometimes the questions are complicated, and the answers are simple.” To me, bear markets can be confusing and complicated, but the answer has always been that they indeed do eventually end, and historically better times will come when they do.

# **Stocks close higher Friday, Nasdaq posts fourth week of gains - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/26/stock-futures-tick-down-after-the-dow-posts-a-five-day-win-streak.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks rose Friday and capped off a winning week fueled by better-than-expected economic growth and a pop in Tesla shares.
*****
&gt; The Nasdaq Composite jumped 0.95% to settle at 11,621.71, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 0.25% to close at 4,070.56. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 28.67 points, or 0.08%, to finish at 33,978.08.
*****
&gt; All the major averages posted a positive week and are on pace for a month of gains. The tech-heavy index rose 4.32% and closed out its fourth week of gains. It’s on pace for its best monthly performance since July. The S&amp;P and Dow added 2.47% and 1.81%, respectively, this week.
*****
&gt; Earnings season pressed on, with strong guidance boosting American Express shares by 10.5% despite a top-and bottom-line miss. Some chip stocks rose even as Intel slumped more than 6% on a dismal earnings report that missed expectations.
*****
&gt; Tesla rose 11% Friday, and more than 33% for the week after reporting record revenue. It marked the electric vehicle stock’s best weekly performance since May 2013.
*****
&gt; So far this year, markets have bucked 2022′s selloff trend. The Dow is up 2.5%, while the S&amp;P has gained 6%. The Nasdaq has surged 11%.
*****
&gt; “We’re putting the final touches on an extremely strong January on the heels of lower inflation, and an economy that’s hanging in there,” said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group. “We’re not out of the woods though. We’ve still got the Fed next week, and they might want to throw some water on this rally.”
*****
&gt; Investors weighed more economic data Friday ahead of next week’s Federal Reserve policy meeting. The personal consumption expenditures price index, excluding energy and food, showed prices rose 4.4% from a year ago, the Commerce Department said, and in line with the Dow Jones estimate. So-called PCE is a preferred inflation gauge for the Fed.
*****
&gt; A better-than-expected fourth-quarter gross domestic product report Thursday also helped stoke hopes that the Fed may manage a soft landing.

&gt; These are some of the last data points before the central bank’s widely expected 25 basis point hike.

&gt; # February Better In Pre-Election Years

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/c4eff32afed2c42603d8164cc899a4ae/3bfc0b06e3404977-44/s500x750/9bac22e482016defabc13bb218e026a0adc0ad57.jpg))**

&gt; Normally the “weak link” of the Best Months, February has been stronger in pre-election years, #5 for DJIA and NASDAQ; #6 for S&amp;P 500 and #4 for Russell 2000. Average gains range from 1.2% by S&amp;P 500 to 2.8% from NASDAQ. Benefitting from January Effect spillover, Russell 2000 averages 2.7% in pre-election Februarys.

&gt; The first trading day of February is bullish for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and 2000. Average gains on the first day over the most recent 21-year period range from 0.39% by DJIA to 0.65% by Russell 2000. However, after a strong opening day, strength has tended to fade until around the fourth trading day. From there until around the 12-trading day all five indexes have historically enjoyed gains. But those gains have not held through the end of February.

&gt; Pre-election-year Februarys going back to 1950 for DJIA and S&amp;P 500, 1971 for NASDAQ and 1979 for Russell 1000 &amp; 2000, exhibit a similar pattern, but the gains have held through the end of the month.

***** 

&gt; # February 2023 Almanac: Historically Solid Gains in Pre-Election Years

&gt; Although February is right in the middle of the Best Six Months, its long-term track record, since 1950, is rather tepid. February ranks no better than sixth and has posted meager average gains except for the Russell 2000. Small cap stocks, benefiting from “January Effect” carry over; historically tend to outpace large cap stocks in February. The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks turns in an average gain of 1.1% in February since 1979—just the sixth best month for that benchmark. Even with the market struggling the past two trading sessions Russell 2000 has maintained a performance lead this January compared to DJIA and S&amp;P 500. This does bode well for the continued outperformance in February by small-cap stocks.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/f47b8e6da59ed858c0949fa14963b2c3/4b58250e91bb3fd3-0d/s400x600/46f1ee1b2a8bb592f7110d2cbae1a4491f738996.jpg))**

&gt; In pre-election years, February’s performance generally improves with average returns all turning positive. NASDAQ performs best, gaining an average 2.8% in pre-election-year Februarys since 1971. Russell 2000 is second best, averaging gains of 2.7% since 1979. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000, the large-cap indices, tend to lag with average advances ranging from 1.2% to 1.7%.

&gt; # 5 Things To Know About Recessions And Bear Markets

&gt; “I am an optimist because I don’t see the point in being anything else.” Abraham Lincoln

&gt; With all the talk about a pending recession and stocks in a bear market, today, I wanted to share some more thoughts and stats on recessions and bear markets.

&gt; Second, taking things a step further, here we broke down the performance based on if the bear market took place in a recession or not. Take note; we did include some ‘near bear markets’ this time to get more instances. Plus, a near bear feels like a bear market if you are in it. What still amazes us about the table below is that the average bear market without a recession was 24%, and this recent bear was 25%. Assuming we avoid a recession and October was indeed low, this was right on the bullseye.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/blog-264-800x361.png))**

&gt; Now take another look at the table above. The last few bear markets recovered quite quickly. In fact, the last three bear markets that didn’t have a recession recovered in four, four, and three months. Something to think about here, as stocks are two months off the October lows.

&gt; Third, this has been making the rounds lately and has been adding to some of the worries. Looking at all the bear markets that took place around a recession, not once did the bear market end before the recession started. In other words, if we are indeed headed for a recession in 2023, this could suggest that new lows may also be quite likely. Incredibly, bears don’t end for another nine months on average after the recession started, before they find their ultimate low. Again, we don’t see a recession, so this wouldn’t be the case now, but the data is quite compelling.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BearMarketEnds-800x332.png))**

&gt; Fourth, the month of October tends to be a bear-market killer. Most bears have met their end during the month of October, more than any other month.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/OctoberEnds-800x338.png))**

&gt; Below, we break down those previous 17 bear (or near bear) markets. The bottom line six of them ended in October, and we think there’s a very good chance number seven just happened.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/blog-632-800x455.png))**

&gt; Fifth and lastly, if October was indeed the bear market low, be open to the idea of higher prices over the coming two years. While not a predictor of future behavior, history shows the markets were up more than 40% a year off of the bear-market lows and up almost 60% two years off of them. During uncertain and volatile situations (like the ones that markets have treated us to in 2022), it can be hard to imagine a positive path forward, and all we see are the obstacles. Stepping back a bit can be a helpful reminder of the resiliency of the markets over the long term.

&gt; Dr. Seuss said, “Sometimes the questions are complicated, and the answers are simple.” To me, bear markets can be confusing and complicated, but the answer has always been that they indeed do eventually end, and historically better times will come when they do.

30,SMCI,Biden to hit China with broader curbs on U.S. chip and tool exports,"The Biden administration plans next month to broaden curbs on U.S shipments to China of semiconductors used for artificial intelligence and chipmaking tools, several people familiar with the matter said. The Commerce Department intends to publish new regulations based on restrictions communicated in letters earlier this year to three U.S. companies — KLA, Lam Research and Applied Materials, the people said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. The plan for new rules has not been previously reported. The letters, which the companies publicly acknowledged, forbade them from exporting chipmaking equipment to Chinese factories that produce advanced semiconductors with sub-14 nanometer processes unless the sellers obtain Commerce Department licenses. The rules would also codify restrictions in Commerce Department letters sent to Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices last month instructing them to halt shipments of several artificial intelligence computing chips to China unless they obtain licenses.

So-called “is informed” letters allow the Commerce Department to bypass lengthy rule-writing processes to put controls in place quickly, but the letters only apply to the companies that receive them. Turning the letters into rules would broaden their reach and could subject other U.S. companies producing similar technology to the restrictions. The regulations could potentially apply to companies trying to challenge Nvidia and AMD’s dominance in artificial intelligence chips. Intel and startups like Cerebras Systems are targeting the same advanced computing markets. Intel said it is closely monitoring the situation, while Cerebras declined to comment.

One source said the rules could also impose license requirements on shipments to China of products that contain the targeted chips. Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Super Micro Computer make data center servers that contain Nvidia’s A100 chip. Dell and HPE said they were monitoring the situation, while Super Micro Computer did not respond to a request for comment.

126,SMCI,Significant Activist Hedge Fund Activity (Last 7 Days),"


These are the latest Schedule 13D forms filed by activist investors in the last 7 days. Activist
investors are investors that make an investment with the intention of influencing management in some way.
There is evidence that following activist investors into investments can generate excess returns.
Schedule 13G forms, in contrast, are filed by significant investors with no intention of influencing management
(such as Index funds).

There is always a lot of interest in insider trades, but what a lot of people probably don't realize
is that hedge fund activity is probably more predictive of future returns than insider activity.
The reason is that hedge funds (a) have large research budgets, and (b) have a choice where to put their money.
In contract, insiders have no choice where to put their money, but only when to time their transactions.

These are the latest Schedule 13D forms filed by activist investors in the last 7 days. Activist
investors are investors that make an investment with the intention of influencing management in some way.
There is evidence that following activist investors into investments can generate excess returns.
Schedule 13G forms, in contrast, are filed by significant investors with no intention of influencing management
(such as Index funds).

There is always a lot of interest in insider trades, but what a lot of people probably don't realize
is that hedge fund activity is probably more predictive of future returns than insider activity.
The reason is that hedge funds (a) have large research budgets, and (b) have a choice where to put their money.
In contract, insiders have no choice where to put their money, but only when to time their transactions.

## New Filings
This table lists new 13D filings in the last week. A new filing does not necessarily indicate a new position,
as investors frequently accumulate in advance before reaching the filing threshold.

135,SMCI,I'm finalizing my portfolio for this year.,"It's been a while since I made a big post. Lots of people are still messaging me about the energy sector post, especially for the ENPH tip, so I'm here to show my portfolio. I don't own all companies yet, this is partially hypothetical. I'm holding on to a reasonable cash position for a possible new downturn, but I have starting positions in most companies and will DCA.

I will try to keep it summarized, as I have done quite a lot of analysis on each of them. I'll draw the main picture and give the most important arguments for my choices, but I'm not expanding too much. If you're interested, you can DM me to talk about them more.

Let me start by saying I'm a growth investor. I always look for a combination of growth with a great track record, if possible at a reasonable price. There are exceptions as you will see below, but the main balance stays the same. I'm not a defensive investor, but no aggressive one either. My timeline is 2-5 years at least (due to a possible start of a small business), but I would gladly hold on to these companies 10+ years.

TLDR; For you guys not interested in my portfolio, I've added a short list of interesting smaller cap companies at the end, most of them trading at decent values.

\-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

**ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES - $AMD**

This one is becoming a blue chip, but has more than enough growth potential to live up to those high valuations. Preferred by gamers and beating their biggest competitor in the CPU market hard. While AMD and INTC were close competitors at the beginning of the 21st century, INTC took the lead by a lot. Since 2017, they introduced 7nm CPU's and GPU's and they are closing the gap fast. Not only are their chips more performant, they are also cheaper. Market cap $60B vs $261b.

Those next generation chips lead them to new partnerships, often beating INTC. Microsoft, a long time Intel customer, began using AMD chips in their Surface laptops. Lenovo using AMD for their new servers. Nvidia started using the chips in their AI products. AMD is also used by Apple's high-end laptops, while Intel (used in the budget range) will probably get replaced by Apple chips made in-house. Apart from laptops, AMD has government contracts to deliver supercomputers in 2021/2023 and they are used in both PS and XBOX consoles, to give a few examples.

For the CPU market, AMD is destined to take over, but they're also taking on NVDA for their GPU's. They have been catching up for years and in 2019 they finally made a better performing GPU in the $350-400 price range. There is a possibility to gain GPU market cap since NVDA has been pushing their prices due to the lack of competition. Therefore, with AMD stepping up their game, they need to give up market share or lower their margins.

**Financial**

Assets over liabilities are x1.88. Cash to debt ratio well above industry average, debt to EBITDA well below IA. ROE 17.12% and ROIC 28.06%. Earnings were growing fast before Covid (125% in Q3, 78% in Q4). Yes they're overvalued, but with their future outlook, I would always buy below $49.

**Doubts**

Now that they are done catching up, the question is, will they outperform in the future. To gain more market share of Nvidia, they need to be better, not equally good. AMD also needs to control the heating better, as it is one of their long term problems.

\-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

**MASTERCARD - $MA**

Fintech companies like SQ and PYPL are a great investment. However, a lot of big companies will (and already did) implement online financial services. MA is able to easily work with multiple of those companies and they're using their global presence pretty well, that's why they're my pick for the fintech industry.

They launched Mastercard Accelerate last year, implementing those online paying platforms and letting start-ups take advantage of their global presence to grow and transform very fast. Last year they acquired Ethoca (managing e-commerce fraud) and Vyze (platform to connect merchants with multiple renders, giving them the opportunity to get those financial needs for start-ups). MA is basically helping start-ups to grow faster, which will result in more financial transactions in the future.

Last but not least, they like to focus on expanding to countries where there isn't much competition yet. They are expanding their exposure to Middle East and Africa, working with local networks and e-commerce platforms. They are in a strong position to capitalize those regions in the future and take on market leader Visa even more.

They get compared a lot to Visa, so I'll expand on that subject a bit as well. While V is focussing on performance and speed, MA plays the cyber security card. They are already working on ways to implement cryptocurrency and Mastercard tend to have more growth potential vs stability from market leader Visa. While V is in the lead, MA is more widely used by fintech companies, which shows potential take-over in the future. Next to their credit services, they also own debit service Maestro, which is widely used in Europe.

**Financial**

Returns as high as 150% (ROE) and 60% (ROIC). Very large margins and perfectly stable balance sheet. High EPS growth YoY, 53% and 42% in the last two years. Quick ratio 1.87. V has more assets and even bigger margins, however MA wins in returns and cash. In terms of more growth, I like to focus on those last numbers more.

**Doubts**

It's a blue chip at a $300B market cap. Their growth potential might be limited, although I see them as one of the better picks between blue chips.

\-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

**ENPHASE ENERGY - $ENPH**

I already talked about solar energy in another post, so I'm gonna skip the explanation. As some of you know my choices were ENPH and SEDG, so I'll explain a bit about why I choose ENPH here. Mainly it's because of their financials, so I'll dive that straight away.

Quick ratio - 2.35 vs 1.74

ROE - 142.94% vs 21.51%

ROIC - 85.51% vs 25.81%

Net margin - 25.81% vs 10.28%

However I think SEDG balance sheet is a lot better and safer, ENPH is working on their future more efficient. They are paving the way smoothly with bigger margins and return on investments. Although SEDG might be the better pick right now, ENPH will be the better one in a short while. ENPH is also a bit less overvalued and their PEG ratio is lower, which makes them the better pick to get in right now.

Diving into the products as well, ENPH just has the better and more efficient product. Their micro inverters are more durable (20 vs 12 years) and give the chance to increase or decrease the amount of solar panels easily, depending on your personal situation.

**GALAPAGOS - $GLPG**

I'm not a big fan of biotech companies, but these guys have my attention. Not because they're working on Covid vaccines, but because of two reasons. First one is them getting back-up from Gilead Sciences. That's the push they needed to start operating worldwide, increasing their potential market cap. Now that they have the cash from GILD, they can keep on buying interesting divisions and increase their growth. While having almost no long term debt, they are set pretty well with about $4 billion extra in cash.

Second, they have multiple medicines in later trial phases, with Filgotinib as their biggest one. They had a setback on those results, but the company is very confident, giving an opportunity to get them at a decent price. I wouldn't be surprised if they partner up with another big pharmaceutical company in the metabolic disease section.

**Financial**

High PE (84 vs 44 average), but PEG ratio is 1.2. Quick ratio 9.28. ROIC 75.91% and ROE 7%. Became profitable this year with 16.25% net margin. 38.7% YoY EPS growth.

**Doubts**

Like all biotech players, there's a lot depending on medicines getting through phase trials and being commercialized. If Filgotinib will fail, their stock will obviously fall. However since they are backed by a big US giant, they can commercialize the product faster and on a bigger global scale if trials succeed. That's what gives them the advantage in comparison to other biotech companies for me.

\-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

**WALT DISNEY - $DIS**

This one has got me doubting a lot. I've taken them off and put them back on my list multiple times, but eventually I decided to keep them at least 2 years to see how they will evolve into streaming.

Biggest advantage they have on their competitors is they basically have a monopoly on kids entertainment. Kids are growing up with electronic devices and content, so they're creating customers at a very young age. That's how Coca Cola used to work. They targeted 14-16 year olds, dumping loads of money into advertising which resulted in life long customers, as people didn't change cola brands often.

Disney+ is a big hit and they won't get so much competition from other streaming services as Netflix and Roku will. They have one of the strongest defined brands out there and they know perfectly how to build and maintain their company. It's also still unclear how sports with public will evolve, but it's certain streaming will become even bigger after Covid. Therefore their money-losing ESPN acquisition could even turn into a moneymaker.

**Financial**

I can't really say great things about their financials. ROE is 12.67%, above 10% is decent. Assets over liabilities are x1.85 and debt to equity is 0.61. You could apply the saying ""too big to fail' here, but that's about it. The bad financials are mainly caused by their big investment to streaming of course and they're working on it hard. They doubled their cash position, increasing their quick ratio from 0.75 to 0.89.

**Doubts**

I would say financials are their weak point here. They still have to go through some bad weather this and next year I would say. Them doubling their cash position in Q1 was soothing, as I see it being the biggest issue for the future. It might be better to wait it out and keep an eye on them for next year, but I wanted to take a position already. Not higher than 8% of my portfolio though.

\-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

**MICROSOFT - $MSFT**

They don't really an introduction I guess. 2nd biggest player for cloud services with Azure. Naming Satya Nadella as CEO and making the transition from hardware to software in 2014 were the best decisions they could've made. Acquired the government contract with Pentagon, however there's still uncertainty about it. In short, Amazon is claiming they were about to win the contract, but Trump criticizing the company would've lead to calling off the deal. For me, that's probably the main reason why MSFT didn't fly as high as their fellow cloud competitors yet.

**Financial**

Assets over liabilities x1.67. ROE and ROIC respectively at 43.82% and 28.88%. Quick ratio of 2.88, 0.65 debt to equity and 1.86 cash to debt. Decent financials, great returns. Talking about blue chips, I would say MSFT is still fairly valued with a PEG ratio just below industry average. Also paying a small dividend.

**Doubts**

The Pentagon contract allegations could be pretty negative for the company. They will probably not come back on their decision, cause if they do, MSFT will claim they already made big investments towards them and things will just keep on dragging on. Even without the contract, MSFT should be a 10 year hold while buying on dips.

\-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

**INNOVATIVE INDUSTRIAL PROPERTIES - $IIPR**

Haven't read a lot about them here on Reddit, but they're a very decent investment. Basically, they buy properties from cannabis companies and leases them back to the sellers, giving them the cash they need to grow faster and IIPR keeps the long term advantage of renting out those properties. They need to buy about 6-8 properties a year to keep their growth rate going and they already bought 7 this year. They still have a lot of cash ready to take advantage of the crisis.

Not only are they 20% undervalued right now, they have a lot more growth potential after that and on top of it, they pay close to 5% dividend. I'm not a big fan of betting on the best cannabis company for the future, but IIPR is a great buy to have exposure in that industry. It doesn't happen very often I come across a company that combines growth potential with a high dividend, but IIPR does.

**Financial**

Quick ratio 6.75, cash to debt 2.8 (while REITs have an 0.07 average). Net margins 13% above average. Assets over liabilities x4.88. Annual EPS growing by more than 150% and about 41% in the last quarter before Covid. They just missed Q1 estimates, but it was only an 8% drop from Q4, performing way better than other REITs.

**Doubts**

IIPR has held a lot of new investment rounds, diluting shares. Of course extra capital will result in higher growth and will eventually be positive in the long run. There has been a drop in these last few days due to the announcement of selling 1 million more shares soon. I would look at it as an opportunity to get an even better price on them.

**TELADOC HEALTH - $TDOC**

It's the only company I don't own yet. I can't force myself to invest more than $140 per share for them, although I really like their business model. A lot of people are skipping doctors visits these days, going straight away to get medicines and counting on the advice of pharmacists. A lot of times, there's more examination needed.

Not only do I see them succeeding in their field, I see them as an essential part of the automation of the pharmacy industry. It's a useful tool in emergencies, giving advice and deciding how serious the condition is, if (fast) medical care is needed. Teladoc will also play a role in insurance and giving the employers a checking tool. 98.9% of their shares are owned by institutions.

**Financial**

In terms of profitability and returns, not great of course. They are estimated to get profitable in 2023. Great balance sheet, assets over liabilities x2.66. Quick ratio 6.14, cash to debt 1.06, debt to equity 0.48.

**Doubts**

It's hard to see if a company is well managed before they are profitable. Their moat isn't very narrow, however I feel being one of the first ones gives you a big advantage in this field.

\-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

**DRAFTKINGS - $DKNG**

Gonna keep this one pretty short, there has been enough posts about Donkey Kong. For me, the most important factor for choosing them in this industry is their fantasy sports section. They are widely popular and that division will only get more interesting while online gambling, and especially in-game betting, gets more and more legalized in the US.

Although they realized major revenue growth in 2019, they almost doubled their earnings loss. Main reason of course having to develop their platform and system. Good thing is, their technology is highly scalable, meaning they margin will grow massively while expanding in to more states and countries. Not many ratios available yet, so that's about the only financial information I own atm.

The only negative I see is their pretty wide moat, so this one should be monitored more closely in the future. But for now, they have the momentum and are one of the most popular choices, great investment.

**RAYTHEON TECHNOLOGIES - $RTX**

As many of you know, two great companies (UTC and RTN) merged together in April. While United focussed on aircraft engines (Pratt &amp; Whitney), Raytheon manufactured weapons, military and commercial electronics. They always delivered advanced technologies and them gaining multiple government contracts in the last decade is confirmation of their performant products.

Raytheon will continue to grow their leadership in different segments. Because of their diversity, they seem perfectly in place to grow even more into an aerospace &amp; defense giant. Engines, aerostructures, avionics, sensors, cybersecurity and other software solutions are just a few examples of their working fields.

**Financial**

With a PE ratio of 13.58 and PB ratio of 1.41, this is probably the most undervalued stock in my portfolio. Assets over liabilities x1.43. The rest of their financials isn't that great. UTC was carrying a lot of debt, but because of the merger, it will be better balanced as RTN was only carrying $2 billion net debt. If they can decrease their debt and optimize their merger, they are set to be the new number one in defense.

**Doubts**

It's still unclear how the merger will work out financially and logistically. In theory, they should be very well armed (pun intended) to take on LMT as market leader. Their exposure to commercial aircrafts is also a big threat, but it's less of an issue because they can make up with their other practices.

\-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

As you can see, I've tried to get the best blue chips with still some growth potential and stable growth companies together. Since a lot of companies already got mentioned on this forum, I'll include a bonus round of interesting companies I came across during my search for the best companies. I didn't include them in my portfolio mainly because I feel the chance of them succeeding and living up to their future potential is more risky than others. For you looking for higher risk, higher reward, check out these companies below.

* **$INMD.** They offer minimally-invasive aesthetic medical products for various procedures, such as liposuction with simultaneous skin tightening, body and face contouring. They are actually the only company in my watchlist that scored maximum on my financial checklist. I love to watch their financials. While we're in an overvalued market, INMD has only 18.73 PE and 0.6 PEG. They certainly got hit by Covid, but I would be very surprised if they don't multiply their market share over the next years.
* **$SMCI.** Based mainly on servers and storage solutions. They are the supplier for cloud computing and AI based companies. They were ranked 18th fastest growing company by Fortune Magazine in 2016, but they still have a long way possible to grow. I see them stagnating a bit for a few years, but they definitely have potential in the long run. Financially very stable, big on cash to make some acquisitions and trading at only 14.84 PE.
* **$CDLX.** Great business model. They basically turn financial transaction data into valuable information for advertising. They show returns as high as 30:1 for advertising spent. Not only is the online payment industry growing fast, but after Covid companies will need to work their advertising budgets even more efficiently. CDLX has momentum and will increase that market cap massively. That future outlook has a price unfortunately and I feel they're too expensive right now.
* **$OLED.** They hold patents on ultra high definition OLED screen technology. There's still a large transition going on from LED to OLED screens. They are estimated to increase their manufacturing with 50% by the end of 2021. Unfortunately most of that growth is already priced in right now. It doesn't take away the longer term potential, but it doesn't make it that sexy of a buy right now.
* **$OMCL.** Omnicell provides pharmacy automation solutions and other tools for healthcare systems. Big on cash, low on debt. They have an interesting business and the automation of healthcare will continue to grow, however they are also trading a bit above value.
* **$PCOM.** A technology company based on e-commerce and services through loyalty programs. Most of their partners are airlines, which explains their difficulties of getting back up since the drop. At the moment it's unsure how this will work out. There will barely be room for bargains or rewards, however while the industry has to build up again, there's an opportunity to take away long time customers from competitors. Although they have enough cash to weather this crisis, they are depending on the industry. At PE below 10 and having a decent cash position, it's worth a gamble.
* **$APPS.** Digital Turbine offers a mobile platform mainly for new apps. They have a very high future revenue forecast of 202.2% over the next 3 years. Big on cash and no debt as well. They already acquired Mobile Posse in March, diversifying their platform. Analysts are putting an average price target of $9.88 on them, giving it a 61% potential return.
* **$NVMI.** They develop and produce process control systems used in the manufacturing of semiconductors, mainly focussing on industrializing X-ray and optical technologies like holographic images. Cash to debt 6.1, debt to equity 0.1, quick ratio 5.75, ROE 12.83% and ROIC 20.26%. Their financials are great. The only thing you could say is they are slightly overvalued, but still a very nice buy in comparison to the overvalued tech industry.
* **$INS.** Active in the fintech sector, they provide tech solutions and processing services. Very similar financials to NVMI. Big on cash, almost no long term debt, great returns (ROE 29.7% / ROIC 85.95%)  and steady growing EPS. They are also slightly overvalued, but should easily get back to $45 range after the crisis is over.

So, that's about all I have to share. This will also be my last big post a while. Analyzing stocks has been my main occupation for the last three months, but it's time to work on opening up the hotel and bar again. I hope some of you get something out of this. I'm not a professional so always check again for yourself. I'm gonna hold on to these companies for a while now. Will add some extra capital at the beginning of 2021, so you could expect another big post about my newest findings then. For now, I'm gonna take a break from following the market day in day out and enjoy the weather a bit more.

Have a good one!",252,58,1590786750.0,2020-05-29T21:12:30+00:00,t3_gt1fha,stocks,"I'm finalizing my portfolio for this year. It's been a while since I made a big post. Lots of people are still messaging me about the energy sector post, especially for the ENPH tip, so I'm here to show my portfolio. I don't own all companies yet, this is partially hypothetical. I'm holding on to a reasonable cash position for a possible new downturn, but I have starting positions in most companies and will DCA.

I will try to keep it summarized, as I have done quite a lot of analysis on each of them. I'll draw the main picture and give the most important arguments for my choices, but I'm not expanding too much. If you're interested, you can DM me to talk about them more.

Let me start by saying I'm a growth investor. I always look for a combination of growth with a great track record, if possible at a reasonable price. There are exceptions as you will see below, but the main balance stays the same. I'm not a defensive investor, but no aggressive one either. My timeline is 2-5 years at least (due to a possible start of a small business), but I would gladly hold on to these companies 10+ years.

TLDR; For you guys not interested in my portfolio, I've added a short list of interesting smaller cap companies at the end, most of them trading at decent values.

**ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES - $AMD**

This one is becoming a blue chip, but has more than enough growth potential to live up to those high valuations. Preferred by gamers and beating their biggest competitor in the CPU market hard. While AMD and INTC were close competitors at the beginning of the 21st century, INTC took the lead by a lot. Since 2017, they introduced 7nm CPU's and GPU's and they are closing the gap fast. Not only are their chips more performant, they are also cheaper. Market cap $60B vs $261b.

Those next generation chips lead them to new partnerships, often beating INTC. Microsoft, a long time Intel customer, began using AMD chips in their Surface laptops. Lenovo using AMD for their new servers. Nvidia started using the chips in their AI products. AMD is also used by Apple's high-end laptops, while Intel (used in the budget range) will probably get replaced by Apple chips made in-house. Apart from laptops, AMD has government contracts to deliver supercomputers in 2021/2023 and they are used in both PS and XBOX consoles, to give a few examples.

For the CPU market, AMD is destined to take over, but they're also taking on NVDA for their GPU's. They have been catching up for years and in 2019 they finally made a better performing GPU in the $350-400 price range. There is a possibility to gain GPU market cap since NVDA has been pushing their prices due to the lack of competition. Therefore, with AMD stepping up their game, they need to give up market share or lower their margins.

**Financial**

Assets over liabilities are x1.88. Cash to debt ratio well above industry average, debt to EBITDA well below IA. ROE 17.12% and ROIC 28.06%. Earnings were growing fast before Covid (125% in Q3, 78% in Q4). Yes they're overvalued, but with their future outlook, I would always buy below $49.

**Doubts**

Now that they are done catching up, the question is, will they outperform in the future. To gain more market share of Nvidia, they need to be better, not equally good. AMD also needs to control the heating better, as it is one of their long term problems.

\-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

**MASTERCARD - $MA**

Fintech companies like SQ and PYPL are a great investment. However, a lot of big companies will (and already did) implement online financial services. MA is able to easily work with multiple of those companies and they're using their global presence pretty well, that's why they're my pick for the fintech industry.

They launched Mastercard Accelerate last year, implementing those online paying platforms and letting start-ups take advantage of their global presence to grow and transform very fast. Last year they acquired Ethoca (managing e-commerce fraud) and Vyze (platform to connect merchants with multiple renders, giving them the opportunity to get those financial needs for start-ups). MA is basically helping start-ups to grow faster, which will result in more financial transactions in the future.

Last but not least, they like to focus on expanding to countries where there isn't much competition yet. They are expanding their exposure to Middle East and Africa, working with local networks and e-commerce platforms. They are in a strong position to capitalize those regions in the future and take on market leader Visa even more.

They get compared a lot to Visa, so I'll expand on that subject a bit as well. While V is focussing on performance and speed, MA plays the cyber security card. They are already working on ways to implement cryptocurrency and Mastercard tend to have more growth potential vs stability from market leader Visa. While V is in the lead, MA is more widely used by fintech companies, which shows potential take-over in the future. Next to their credit services, they also own debit service Maestro, which is widely used in Europe.

**Financial**

Returns as high as 150% (ROE) and 60% (ROIC). Very large margins and perfectly stable balance sheet. High EPS growth YoY, 53% and 42% in the last two years. Quick ratio 1.87. V has more assets and even bigger margins, however MA wins in returns and cash. In terms of more growth, I like to focus on those last numbers more.

**Doubts**

It's a blue chip at a $300B market cap. Their growth potential might be limited, although I see them as one of the better picks between blue chips.

\-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

**ENPHASE ENERGY - $ENPH**

I already talked about solar energy in another post, so I'm gonna skip the explanation. As some of you know my choices were ENPH and SEDG, so I'll explain a bit about why I choose ENPH here. Mainly it's because of their financials, so I'll dive that straight away.

Quick ratio - 2.35 vs 1.74

ROE - 142.94% vs 21.51%

ROIC - 85.51% vs 25.81%

Net margin - 25.81% vs 10.28%

However I think SEDG balance sheet is a lot better and safer, ENPH is working on their future more efficient. They are paving the way smoothly with bigger margins and return on investments. Although SEDG might be the better pick right now, ENPH will be the better one in a short while. ENPH is also a bit less overvalued and their PEG ratio is lower, which makes them the better pick to get in right now.

Diving into the products as well, ENPH just has the better and more efficient product. Their micro inverters are more durable (20 vs 12 years) and give the chance to increase or decrease the amount of solar panels easily, depending on your personal situation.

**GALAPAGOS - $GLPG**

I'm not a big fan of biotech companies, but these guys have my attention. Not because they're working on Covid vaccines, but because of two reasons. First one is them getting back-up from Gilead Sciences. That's the push they needed to start operating worldwide, increasing their potential market cap. Now that they have the cash from GILD, they can keep on buying interesting divisions and increase their growth. While having almost no long term debt, they are set pretty well with about $4 billion extra in cash.

Second, they have multiple medicines in later trial phases, with Filgotinib as their biggest one. They had a setback on those results, but the company is very confident, giving an opportunity to get them at a decent price. I wouldn't be surprised if they partner up with another big pharmaceutical company in the metabolic disease section.

**Financial**

High PE (84 vs 44 average), but PEG ratio is 1.2. Quick ratio 9.28. ROIC 75.91% and ROE 7%. Became profitable this year with 16.25% net margin. 38.7% YoY EPS growth.

**Doubts**

Like all biotech players, there's a lot depending on medicines getting through phase trials and being commercialized. If Filgotinib will fail, their stock will obviously fall. However since they are backed by a big US giant, they can commercialize the product faster and on a bigger global scale if trials succeed. That's what gives them the advantage in comparison to other biotech companies for me.

\-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

**WALT DISNEY - $DIS**

This one has got me doubting a lot. I've taken them off and put them back on my list multiple times, but eventually I decided to keep them at least 2 years to see how they will evolve into streaming.

Biggest advantage they have on their competitors is they basically have a monopoly on kids entertainment. Kids are growing up with electronic devices and content, so they're creating customers at a very young age. That's how Coca Cola used to work. They targeted 14-16 year olds, dumping loads of money into advertising which resulted in life long customers, as people didn't change cola brands often.

Disney+ is a big hit and they won't get so much competition from other streaming services as Netflix and Roku will. They have one of the strongest defined brands out there and they know perfectly how to build and maintain their company. It's also still unclear how sports with public will evolve, but it's certain streaming will become even bigger after Covid. Therefore their money-losing ESPN acquisition could even turn into a moneymaker.

**Financial**

I can't really say great things about their financials. ROE is 12.67%, above 10% is decent. Assets over liabilities are x1.85 and debt to equity is 0.61. You could apply the saying ""too big to fail' here, but that's about it. The bad financials are mainly caused by their big investment to streaming of course and they're working on it hard. They doubled their cash position, increasing their quick ratio from 0.75 to 0.89.

**Doubts**

I would say financials are their weak point here. They still have to go through some bad weather this and next year I would say. Them doubling their cash position in Q1 was soothing, as I see it being the biggest issue for the future. It might be better to wait it out and keep an eye on them for next year, but I wanted to take a position already. Not higher than 8% of my portfolio though.

\-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

**MICROSOFT - $MSFT**

They don't really an introduction I guess. 2nd biggest player for cloud services with Azure. Naming Satya Nadella as CEO and making the transition from hardware to software in 2014 were the best decisions they could've made. Acquired the government contract with Pentagon, however there's still uncertainty about it. In short, Amazon is claiming they were about to win the contract, but Trump criticizing the company would've lead to calling off the deal. For me, that's probably the main reason why MSFT didn't fly as high as their fellow cloud competitors yet.

**Financial**

Assets over liabilities x1.67. ROE and ROIC respectively at 43.82% and 28.88%. Quick ratio of 2.88, 0.65 debt to equity and 1.86 cash to debt. Decent financials, great returns. Talking about blue chips, I would say MSFT is still fairly valued with a PEG ratio just below industry average. Also paying a small dividend.

**Doubts**

The Pentagon contract allegations could be pretty negative for the company. They will probably not come back on their decision, cause if they do, MSFT will claim they already made big investments towards them and things will just keep on dragging on. Even without the contract, MSFT should be a 10 year hold while buying on dips.

\-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

**INNOVATIVE INDUSTRIAL PROPERTIES - $IIPR**

Haven't read a lot about them here on Reddit, but they're a very decent investment. Basically, they buy properties from cannabis companies and leases them back to the sellers, giving them the cash they need to grow faster and IIPR keeps the long term advantage of renting out those properties. They need to buy about 6-8 properties a year to keep their growth rate going and they already bought 7 this year. They still have a lot of cash ready to take advantage of the crisis.

Not only are they 20% undervalued right now, they have a lot more growth potential after that and on top of it, they pay close to 5% dividend. I'm not a big fan of betting on the best cannabis company for the future, but IIPR is a great buy to have exposure in that industry. It doesn't happen very often I come across a company that combines growth potential with a high dividend, but IIPR does.

**Financial**

Quick ratio 6.75, cash to debt 2.8 (while REITs have an 0.07 average). Net margins 13% above average. Assets over liabilities x4.88. Annual EPS growing by more than 150% and about 41% in the last quarter before Covid. They just missed Q1 estimates, but it was only an 8% drop from Q4, performing way better than other REITs.

Backtesting example: DIA predicting 3 days into the future, 67% accuracy, size of moves within 12%: [https://imgur.com/X2GEd8F](https://imgur.com/X2GEd8F)

&amp;#x200B;

Quick Explanation: this approach is based on kinematic principles, which is the branch of physics and mathematics describing the motions of objects without necessarily understanding the underlying forces at play. My script runs a loop from 50 to 10 days, and for each period computes the SMA and its first three derivatives, which I then combine via a weighted average with the weights set by the inverse of each SMA period. The first derivative is analogous to the stock's ""velocity"" (in %/day), the 2nd derivative is its ""acceleration"" (%/day\^2), and the third derivative is the “jerk”, or change in acceleration (%/day\^3). Using these three parameters, I extrapolate the price of each stock on my watchlist 3 days into the future (previously 10) in order to inform my own trading strategy.

This approach is highly simplistic: it involves no tracking of news feeds, expectations of financials, etc. (in other words, the forces behind the movements). It is simply based on the motions of each stock. I'd be interested to hear if anyone has tried a similar strategy, or has any comments/questions. If you'd like your favorite stock added, just let me know.

Source code can be found on github: [https://github.com/stockscientist/sma\_optimize\_stocks](https://github.com/stockscientist/sma_optimize_stocks)

Also, I recently found this paper on a similar topic in case anyone else is interested: [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46461895\_Kinematics\_of\_stock\_prices](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46461895_Kinematics_of_stock_prices)

Disclosure: First and foremost, I attempt to make no claim whatsoever for how well these predictions will hold. They are simple extrapolations of existing trends, and will certainly change in the future. Second, I likely own positions in several of the highest ranked tickers on this list.

Cheers!

Backtesting example: DIA predicting 3 days into the future, 67% accuracy, size of moves within 12%: [https://imgur.com/X2GEd8F](https://imgur.com/X2GEd8F)

&amp;#x200B;

Quick Explanation: this approach is based on kinematic principles, which is the branch of physics and mathematics describing the motions of objects without necessarily understanding the underlying forces at play. My script runs a loop from 50 to 10 days, and for each period computes the SMA and its first three derivatives, which I then combine via a weighted average with the weights set by the inverse of each SMA period. The first derivative is analogous to the stock's ""velocity"" (in %/day), the 2nd derivative is its ""acceleration"" (%/day\^2), and the third derivative is the “jerk”, or change in acceleration (%/day\^3). Using these three parameters, I extrapolate the price of each stock on my watchlist 3 days into the future (previously 10) in order to inform my own trading strategy.

This approach is highly simplistic: it involves no tracking of news feeds, expectations of financials, etc. (in other words, the forces behind the movements). It is simply based on the motions of each stock. I'd be interested to hear if anyone has tried a similar strategy, or has any comments/questions. If you'd like your favorite stock added, just let me know.

Source code can be found on github: [https://github.com/stockscientist/sma\_optimize\_stocks](https://github.com/stockscientist/sma_optimize_stocks)

Also, I recently found this paper on a similar topic in case anyone else is interested: [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46461895\_Kinematics\_of\_stock\_prices](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46461895_Kinematics_of_stock_prices)

Disclosure: First and foremost, I attempt to make no claim whatsoever for how well these predictions will hold. They are simple extrapolations of existing trends, and will certainly change in the future. Second, I likely own positions in several of the highest ranked tickers on this list.

Cheers!

137,SMCI,"Here are my kinematic stock models: comments, discussion, and suggestions welcome! (March 19, 2019)","Sixth post in the series! Thanks so much everyone for your feedback, ideas, discussions, bug reports, motivation, etc.

Previous post here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/b2y81q/im\_an\_astrophysicist\_and\_i\_perform\_my\_own\_simple/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/b2y81q/im_an_astrophysicist_and_i_perform_my_own_simple/)

Backtesting example: S&amp;P500 past 15 years predicting 10 days into the future, 64% accuracy, size of moves within 2x: [https://imgur.com/a/0w3U8EK](https://imgur.com/a/0w3U8EK)

2nd example: DIA predicting 3 days into the future, 67% accuracy, size of moves within 12%: [https://imgur.com/X2GEd8F](https://imgur.com/X2GEd8F)

Update: I've tested several periods for predicting into the future, and found that changing from 10 days to 3 days significantly improved the size of the predicted moves to within 15%. Predictions will now be given three days in advance.

Quick Explanation: this approach is based on kinematic principles, which is the branch of physics and mathematics describing the motions of objects without necessarily understanding the underlying forces at play. My script runs a loop from 50 to 10 days, and for each period computes the SMA and its first three derivatives, which I then combine via a weighted average with the weights set by the inverse of each SMA period. The first derivative is analogous to the stock's ""velocity"" (in %/day), the 2nd derivative is its ""acceleration"" (%/day\^2), and the third derivative is the “jerk”, or change in acceleration (%/day\^3). Using these three parameters, I extrapolate the price of each stock on my watchlist 3 days into the future (previously 10) in order to inform my own trading strategy.

This approach is highly simplistic: it involves no tracking of news feeds, expectations of financials, etc. (in other words, the forces behind the movements). It is simply based on the motions of each stock. I'd be interested to hear if anyone has tried a similar strategy, or has any comments/questions. If you'd like your favorite stock added, just let me know.

Source code can be found on github: [https://github.com/stockscientist/sma\_optimize\_stocks](https://github.com/stockscientist/sma_optimize_stocks)

Also, I recently found this paper on a similar topic in case anyone else is interested: [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46461895\_Kinematics\_of\_stock\_prices](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46461895_Kinematics_of_stock_prices)

Disclosure: First and foremost, I attempt to make no claim whatsoever for how well these predictions will hold. They are simple extrapolations of existing trends, and will certainly change in the future. Second, I likely own positions in several of the highest ranked tickers on this list.

Cheers!

Previous post here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/b2y81q/im\_an\_astrophysicist\_and\_i\_perform\_my\_own\_simple/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/b2y81q/im_an_astrophysicist_and_i_perform_my_own_simple/)

Backtesting example: S&amp;P500 past 15 years predicting 10 days into the future, 64% accuracy, size of moves within 2x: [https://imgur.com/a/0w3U8EK](https://imgur.com/a/0w3U8EK)

2nd example: DIA predicting 3 days into the future, 67% accuracy, size of moves within 12%: [https://imgur.com/X2GEd8F](https://imgur.com/X2GEd8F)

Update: I've tested several periods for predicting into the future, and found that changing from 10 days to 3 days significantly improved the size of the predicted moves to within 15%. Predictions will now be given three days in advance.

Quick Explanation: this approach is based on kinematic principles, which is the branch of physics and mathematics describing the motions of objects without necessarily understanding the underlying forces at play. My script runs a loop from 50 to 10 days, and for each period computes the SMA and its first three derivatives, which I then combine via a weighted average with the weights set by the inverse of each SMA period. The first derivative is analogous to the stock's ""velocity"" (in %/day), the 2nd derivative is its ""acceleration"" (%/day\^2), and the third derivative is the “jerk”, or change in acceleration (%/day\^3). Using these three parameters, I extrapolate the price of each stock on my watchlist 3 days into the future (previously 10) in order to inform my own trading strategy.

This approach is highly simplistic: it involves no tracking of news feeds, expectations of financials, etc. (in other words, the forces behind the movements). It is simply based on the motions of each stock. I'd be interested to hear if anyone has tried a similar strategy, or has any comments/questions. If you'd like your favorite stock added, just let me know.

Source code can be found on github: [https://github.com/stockscientist/sma\_optimize\_stocks](https://github.com/stockscientist/sma_optimize_stocks)

Also, I recently found this paper on a similar topic in case anyone else is interested: [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46461895\_Kinematics\_of\_stock\_prices](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46461895_Kinematics_of_stock_prices)

Disclosure: First and foremost, I attempt to make no claim whatsoever for how well these predictions will hold. They are simple extrapolations of existing trends, and will certainly change in the future. Second, I likely own positions in several of the highest ranked tickers on this list.

Cheers!

138,SMCI,"I'm an astrophysicist and I perform my own (simple) stock analyses based on kinematic principles: comments welcome! (March 19, 2019)","Fifth post in the series! Thanks so much everyone for your feedback, ideas, discussions, bug reports, motivation, etc.

Backtesting example: S&amp;P500 past 15 years, 64% accuracy: [https://imgur.com/a/0w3U8EK](https://imgur.com/a/0w3U8EK)

Update: I've done quite a bit of work backtesting this script, and now have a visualization of how well this is doing to share with you. I ran my model on the S&amp;P 500 for the past 15 years with the same strategy that I use now. I saved the predictions for each 10 day period, and the actual stock price, and show these in the top plot of this image. The blue shows the predictions and the black shows the actual price. To check the amount of time that the two lines are going in the same direction, and also their overall rate of change, I took the discrete derivative and plot this on the bottom. When the two are going in the same direction, the background is green (and red when the predicted direction fails). It looks to be working about 64% of the time. It also allows you to see just how badly it is off: this typically follows a huge jump (see near day 170, 210, etc.) Once the derivatives get shaken up in other words, it starts to perform worse (as expected). Another useful result of the above example: the typical moves are over estimated (for S&amp;P over this timeframe) by 56%. I've updated the backtesting script on github so that now it is easy to plug in a single stock, timeframes, etc.,

Quick Explanation: this approach is based on kinematic principles, which is the branch of physics and mathematics describing the motions of objects without necessarily understanding the underlying forces at play. My script runs a loop from 50 to 10 days, and for each period computes the SMA and its first three derivatives, which I then combine via a weighted average with the weights set by the inverse of each SMA period. The first derivative is analogous to the stock's ""velocity"" (in %/day), the 2nd derivative is its ""acceleration"" (%/day\^2), and the third derivative is the “jerk”, or change in acceleration (%/day\^3). Using these three parameters, I extrapolate the price of each stock on my watchlist 10 days into the future in order to inform my own trading strategy.

This approach is highly simplistic: it involves no tracking of news feeds, expectations of financials, etc. (in other words, the forces behind the movements). It is simply based on the motions of each stock. I'd be interested to hear if anyone has tried a similar strategy, or has any comments/questions. If you'd like your favorite stock added, just let me know.

Source code can be found on github: [https://github.com/stockscientist/sma\_optimize\_stocks](https://github.com/stockscientist/sma_optimize_stocks)

Also, I recently found this paper on a similar topic in case anyone else is interested: [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46461895\_Kinematics\_of\_stock\_prices](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46461895_Kinematics_of_stock_prices)

Disclosure: First and foremost, I attempt to make no claim whatsoever for how well these predictions will hold. They are simple extrapolations of existing trends, and will certainly change in the future. Second, I likely own positions in several of the highest ranked tickers on this list.

Cheers!

Backtesting example: S&amp;P500 past 15 years, 64% accuracy: [https://imgur.com/a/0w3U8EK](https://imgur.com/a/0w3U8EK)

Update: I've done quite a bit of work backtesting this script, and now have a visualization of how well this is doing to share with you. I ran my model on the S&amp;P 500 for the past 15 years with the same strategy that I use now. I saved the predictions for each 10 day period, and the actual stock price, and show these in the top plot of this image. The blue shows the predictions and the black shows the actual price. To check the amount of time that the two lines are going in the same direction, and also their overall rate of change, I took the discrete derivative and plot this on the bottom. When the two are going in the same direction, the background is green (and red when the predicted direction fails). It looks to be working about 64% of the time. It also allows you to see just how badly it is off: this typically follows a huge jump (see near day 170, 210, etc.) Once the derivatives get shaken up in other words, it starts to perform worse (as expected). Another useful result of the above example: the typical moves are over estimated (for S&amp;P over this timeframe) by 56%. I've updated the backtesting script on github so that now it is easy to plug in a single stock, timeframes, etc.,

Quick Explanation: this approach is based on kinematic principles, which is the branch of physics and mathematics describing the motions of objects without necessarily understanding the underlying forces at play. My script runs a loop from 50 to 10 days, and for each period computes the SMA and its first three derivatives, which I then combine via a weighted average with the weights set by the inverse of each SMA period. The first derivative is analogous to the stock's ""velocity"" (in %/day), the 2nd derivative is its ""acceleration"" (%/day\^2), and the third derivative is the “jerk”, or change in acceleration (%/day\^3). Using these three parameters, I extrapolate the price of each stock on my watchlist 10 days into the future in order to inform my own trading strategy.

This approach is highly simplistic: it involves no tracking of news feeds, expectations of financials, etc. (in other words, the forces behind the movements). It is simply based on the motions of each stock. I'd be interested to hear if anyone has tried a similar strategy, or has any comments/questions. If you'd like your favorite stock added, just let me know.

Source code can be found on github: [https://github.com/stockscientist/sma\_optimize\_stocks](https://github.com/stockscientist/sma_optimize_stocks)

Also, I recently found this paper on a similar topic in case anyone else is interested: [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46461895\_Kinematics\_of\_stock\_prices](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46461895_Kinematics_of_stock_prices)

Disclosure: First and foremost, I attempt to make no claim whatsoever for how well these predictions will hold. They are simple extrapolations of existing trends, and will certainly change in the future. Second, I likely own positions in several of the highest ranked tickers on this list.

Cheers!

This current post reflects Monday's opening moves. I may

Quick Explanation: this approach is based on kinematic principles, which is the branch of physics and mathematics describing the motions of objects without necessarily understanding the underlying forces at play. My script runs a loop from 50 to 10 days, and for each period computes the SMA and its first three derivatives, which I then combine via a weighted average with the weights set by the inverse of each SMA period. The first derivative is analogous to the stock's ""velocity"" (in %/day), the 2nd derivative is its ""acceleration"" (%/day\^2), and the third derivative is the “jerk”, or change in acceleration (%/day\^3). Using these three parameters, I extrapolate the price of each stock on my watchlist 10 days into the future in order to inform my own trading strategy.

This approach is highly simplistic: it involves no tracking of news feeds, expectations of financials, etc. (in other words, the forces behind the movements). It is simply based on the motions of each stock. I'd be interested to hear if anyone has tried a similar strategy, or has any comments/questions. If you'd like your favorite stock added, just let me know.

Also, I recently found this paper on a similar topic in case anyone else is interested: [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46461895\_Kinematics\_of\_stock\_prices](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46461895_Kinematics_of_stock_prices)

\*\*\*A note about backtesting:\*\* this has been a topic of very heavy discussion in the past threads. While I aim to perform more tests in the coming days, please see the previous posts for past discussions and results.

Disclosure: First and foremost, I attempt to make no claim whatsoever for how well these predictions will hold. They are simple extrapolations of existing trends, and will certainly change in the future. Second, I likely own positions in several of the highest ranked tickers on this list.

Cheers!

This current post reflects Monday's opening moves. I may

Quick Explanation: this approach is based on kinematic principles, which is the branch of physics and mathematics describing the motions of objects without necessarily understanding the underlying forces at play. My script runs a loop from 50 to 10 days, and for each period computes the SMA and its first three derivatives, which I then combine via a weighted average with the weights set by the inverse of each SMA period. The first derivative is analogous to the stock's ""velocity"" (in %/day), the 2nd derivative is its ""acceleration"" (%/day\^2), and the third derivative is the “jerk”, or change in acceleration (%/day\^3). Using these three parameters, I extrapolate the price of each stock on my watchlist 10 days into the future in order to inform my own trading strategy.

This approach is highly simplistic: it involves no tracking of news feeds, expectations of financials, etc. (in other words, the forces behind the movements). It is simply based on the motions of each stock. I'd be interested to hear if anyone has tried a similar strategy, or has any comments/questions. If you'd like your favorite stock added, just let me know.

Also, I recently found this paper on a similar topic in case anyone else is interested: [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46461895\_Kinematics\_of\_stock\_prices](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46461895_Kinematics_of_stock_prices)

\*\*\*A note about backtesting:\*\* this has been a topic of very heavy discussion in the past threads. While I aim to perform more tests in the coming days, please see the previous posts for past discussions and results.

Disclosure: First and foremost, I attempt to make no claim whatsoever for how well these predictions will hold. They are simple extrapolations of existing trends, and will certainly change in the future. Second, I likely own positions in several of the highest ranked tickers on this list.

Cheers!

140,SMCI,"I'm an astrophysicist and I perform my own (simple) stock analyses based on kinematic principles: comments welcome! (March 17, 2019)","Third post of the series! Thanks for everyone’s wonderful feedback so far and to the r/stocks moderators for their excellent support! This post reflects Friday's moves, and I am posting today (Sunday) in preparation for the upcoming trading week.

&amp;#x200B;

Quick Explanation: this approach is based on kinematic principles, which is the branch of physics and mathematics describing the motions of objects without necessarily understanding the underlying forces at play.  My script runs a loop from 50 (previously 200) to 10 days, and for each period computes the SMA and its first three derivatives, which I then combine via a weighted average with the weights set by the inverse of each SMA period. The first derivative is analogous to the stock's ""velocity"" (in %/day), the 2nd derivative is its ""acceleration"" (%/day\^2), and the third derivative is the “jerk”, or change in acceleration (%/day\^3). Using these three parameters, I extrapolate the price of each stock on my watchlist 10 days into the future in order to inform my own trading strategy.

&amp;#x200B;

This approach is highly simplistic: it involves no tracking of news feeds, expectations of financials, etc. (in other words, the forces behind the movements). It is simply based on the motions of each stock. I'd be interested to hear if anyone has tried a similar strategy, or has any comments/questions. If you'd like your favorite stock added, just let me know.

Thanks to all of your feedback yesterday, I've made a few improvements since my last post:

&amp;#x200B;

1. I cleaned up my source code for public consumption, which can be found on github: [https://github.com/stockscientist/sma\_optimize\_stocks](https://github.com/stockscientist/sma_optimize_stocks)
2. Most importantly, backtesting! This has been a frequently asked question, and is without doubt an important undertaking. While more rigorous backtesting is always warranted, here’s what I have done so far: Taking SPY, DIA, and NDAQ as test cases, I ran a loop over the script (included as backtest.pro on github) and tested the predictions against the actual data. I examined mainly the directional accuracy (whether the price goes up or down), and used these to tune several of the parameters: namely how many derivatives to include in the projections, which max/min SMA periods to include, and how to optimally weight the outputs from different SMAs.Going back 1000 days and predicting 10 days into the future, this script was \*on average\* 61% correct at predicting the direction of change for SPY, DIA, and NDAQ. I think this is pretty decent, though of course far from perfect. Other sets of parameters that I tested typically yielded between 50-55% accuracy. For comparison, see [this](https://hackernoon.com/i-spent-20-minutes-trying-to-predict-the-stock-market-with-ai-these-are-my-results-59d48c7a388a) machine learning approach that generated excitement from the financial crowd with 54% accuracy.
3. I am now including a relative strength index (RSI) column in the table to help identify when a stock is overbought/oversold. A typical strategy is to consider RSI&gt;70 to be overbought, and RSI&lt;30 to be oversold. I try to maintain a portfolio of stocks between those values, although it’s possible for an RSI to remain over 70 (or below 30) for a significant period of time. Take any predictions for stocks with RSI&gt;70 with extreme caution as they are likely to experience a reversal!
4. Based on the results of the backtesting, I have changed the maximum SMA from 200 to 50, and have included the third derivative in the price projections.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I recently found this paper on a similar topic in case anyone else is interested: [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46461895\_Kinematics\_of\_stock\_prices](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46461895_Kinematics_of_stock_prices)

Cheers!

Disclosure: First and foremost, I attempt to make no claim whatsoever for how well these predictions will hold. They are simple extrapolations of existing trends, and will certainly change in the future. Second, I likely own positions in several of the highest ranked tickers on this list.

(March 17, 2019) Third post of the series! Thanks for everyone’s wonderful feedback so far and to the r/stocks moderators for their excellent support! This post reflects Friday's moves, and I am posting today (Sunday) in preparation for the upcoming trading week.

&amp;#x200B;

Quick Explanation: this approach is based on kinematic principles, which is the branch of physics and mathematics describing the motions of objects without necessarily understanding the underlying forces at play.  My script runs a loop from 50 (previously 200) to 10 days, and for each period computes the SMA and its first three derivatives, which I then combine via a weighted average with the weights set by the inverse of each SMA period. The first derivative is analogous to the stock's ""velocity"" (in %/day), the 2nd derivative is its ""acceleration"" (%/day\^2), and the third derivative is the “jerk”, or change in acceleration (%/day\^3). Using these three parameters, I extrapolate the price of each stock on my watchlist 10 days into the future in order to inform my own trading strategy.

&amp;#x200B;

This approach is highly simplistic: it involves no tracking of news feeds, expectations of financials, etc. (in other words, the forces behind the movements). It is simply based on the motions of each stock. I'd be interested to hear if anyone has tried a similar strategy, or has any comments/questions. If you'd like your favorite stock added, just let me know.

Thanks to all of your feedback yesterday, I've made a few improvements since my last post:

&amp;#x200B;

1. I cleaned up my source code for public consumption, which can be found on github: [https://github.com/stockscientist/sma\_optimize\_stocks](https://github.com/stockscientist/sma_optimize_stocks)
2. Most importantly, backtesting! This has been a frequently asked question, and is without doubt an important undertaking. While more rigorous backtesting is always warranted, here’s what I have done so far: Taking SPY, DIA, and NDAQ as test cases, I ran a loop over the script (included as backtest.pro on github) and tested the predictions against the actual data. I examined mainly the directional accuracy (whether the price goes up or down), and used these to tune several of the parameters: namely how many derivatives to include in the projections, which max/min SMA periods to include, and how to optimally weight the outputs from different SMAs.Going back 1000 days and predicting 10 days into the future, this script was \*on average\* 61% correct at predicting the direction of change for SPY, DIA, and NDAQ. I think this is pretty decent, though of course far from perfect. Other sets of parameters that I tested typically yielded between 50-55% accuracy. For comparison, see [this](https://hackernoon.com/i-spent-20-minutes-trying-to-predict-the-stock-market-with-ai-these-are-my-results-59d48c7a388a) machine learning approach that generated excitement from the financial crowd with 54% accuracy.
3. I am now including a relative strength index (RSI) column in the table to help identify when a stock is overbought/oversold. A typical strategy is to consider RSI&gt;70 to be overbought, and RSI&lt;30 to be oversold. I try to maintain a portfolio of stocks between those values, although it’s possible for an RSI to remain over 70 (or below 30) for a significant period of time. Take any predictions for stocks with RSI&gt;70 with extreme caution as they are likely to experience a reversal!
4. Based on the results of the backtesting, I have changed the maximum SMA from 200 to 50, and have included the third derivative in the price projections.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I recently found this paper on a similar topic in case anyone else is interested: [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46461895\_Kinematics\_of\_stock\_prices](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46461895_Kinematics_of_stock_prices)

Cheers!

Disclosure: First and foremost, I attempt to make no claim whatsoever for how well these predictions will hold. They are simple extrapolations of existing trends, and will certainly change in the future. Second, I likely own positions in several of the highest ranked tickers on this list.

I currently rely on yahoo finance and seeking alpha mostly for stock related news for my stock picks like comparing how it performs relatively to how it performed last year during this quarter

Any recommendations for free stock analysis websites? 

Also, I have 150 dollars and looking to diversify my portfolio with a stock in the food industry or invest in 2-3 low-medium volatility stock. Any recommendations/advice? I'm considering in investing in General Mills but some/most firms have downgraded it to holding. 

Also, I'm trying to be a more disciplined investor but it's hard not to ignore some of the sensational advice from the Motley Fool or Mad Money. Are there any reliable websites with stock analysis of smaller stocks with great potential?

They seem to have great revenue and sales growth over the past couple years, which is a solid sign.  The PEG (for 5 years projected growth) is 1.45, which still states it is overvalued, I know. Their earnings growth forecast for the next year is 44.40% and 15% for the next 3-5 years.  For those of you who want a source of income from dividends, SMCI does not pay dividends, sorry.  With a net profit margin of 4.88%, they are in the upper-middle as compared to their industry peers.  Their ROA= 10.37%, ROE= 17.93%, ROI= 17.33%..all of which crush their industry peers.  Let me know what you guys think or if you have any other questions!!!",2,0,1422562980.0,2015-01-29T20:23:00+00:00,t3_2u49nc,investing,"Thoughts on SMCI?!
