15,GOOG,"TSMC’s October sales rose 16.9%, the slowest since Feb 2024, fueling debate over whether the AI chip boom is losing momentum","No paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tsmc-slowing-monthly-sales-fuel-072623633.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tsmc-slowing-monthly-sales-fuel-072623633.html)

&gt;Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported slowing growth in monthly revenue, highlighting uncertainty over the sustainability of the AI boom even as industry behemoths including Nvidia Corp. chase more chip supplies.

&gt;The company posted a 16.9% rise in sales for October, the slowest pace since February 2024. Analysts on average are expecting sales to increase 16% in the current quarter. TSMC’s American depository receipts were up as much as 3% in pre-market trading.

&gt;Industry executives remain buoyant about AI-driven growth as major tech firms are accelerating investments in data centers. The TSMC revenue gain also just covers just a single month of business, offering investors less insight.

&gt;Investors were jolted last week by a sudden slump in Asia’s technology shares, which served as a stark reminder that the world-beating rally in artificial intelligence and semiconductor stocks may be nearing a short-term crest. Wall Street chief executives have warned of an overdue market correction, with Michael Burry’s Scion Asset Management also disclosing bearish wagers on Nvidia.

&gt;That’s despite massive ample spending plans from leading AI players.

&gt;Meta Platforms Inc., Alphabet Inc., [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com) Inc. and Microsoft Corp. will collectively spend more than $400 billion to fund an AI buildout next year, a 21% hike from 2025, to secure leadership in the race in emerging technologies.

&gt;Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang of Nvidia, which is the primary AI chip supplier to major companies, said on Saturday his business is “growing month by month, stronger and stronger.”

&gt;Huang met TSMC Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei and asked for more chip supplies during his two-day whirlwind trip to Taiwan this time when major chip designers are all chasing limited supplies from the Hsinchu-based company.

&gt;TSMC is also the go-to chipmaker for the Santa Clara, California-based firm’s competitors including Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Qualcomm Inc., and it makes Apple Inc.’s silicon for iPhones and other gadgets.

&gt;Huang’s optimism is shared by his rivals. Qualcomm Chief Executive Officer Cristiano Amon told Bloomberg TV last week that the world is underestimating how big AI will get.

&gt;In October, Wei told analysts that TSMC’s capacity was still very tight and the company is working hard to narrow the gap between demand and supplies.

16,GOOG,Why the bubble narrative is a generational GOOG buying opportunity,"Have gotten 20+ messages asking me if / when I plan to sell my GOOG LEAP position. So sharing my thoughts here:

You basically can’t go 20 seconds without hearing someone mention the tech / AI bubble these days. It’s completely unavoidable and is shaping how people invest more than you may realize. But here’s why I think this narrative is actually creating a generational buying opportunity for a few companies.

People are conflating the AI bubble and the massive growth of the Mag 6. But fail to acknowledge that, barring Nvidia, the Mag 6 growth is almost 100% due to non-LLM based bottom line growth. These monopolies are putting up Jokic numbers that justify these valuations.

This brings us to Google, one of the most oversold stocks in the entire market (until very recently). After reporting a record breaking 100M revenue quarter, and beating EPS expectations by over 30%, GOOG stayed completely flat. Touted as part of the “frothy and way overbought” Mag 7, GOOG’s PE ratio of 27.91 is LOWER THAN SPY’s PE of 28.89.

Let me repeat that for you:

One of the three companies that can manufacture cutting edge AI chips at scale, the HIGHEST NET PROFIT COMPANY ON THE PLANET, that grew every part of its business double digits YoY, has a lower PE ratio than:

-Walmart
-Caterpillar
-Costco
-Nike
-Hilton
-Pepsi


Talk about overvaluation. I’d argue the rest of SPY is more bubbly, as they are being bought via Index funds en masse due to MAG 7 gains, but aren’t being shorted like the MAG 7 are because that doesn’t fit the narrative.


The way I see it, even if we are in a bubble, google does not depend on AI contracts dated 1-4 years out in the way that other players in the space do, as they consume the lions share of their own compute with their money printing businesses.


And if we aren’t in a bubble, and those who control AI control the world, then google is probably the best positioned company out there. They have the strongest AI talent, have several already vetted AI business (Isomorphic labs, Waymo, Search, Shorts), own the entire AI stack: applications, models, chips, data centers (they have 10+ yoe building massive TPU data-centers on time).


The absurd undervaluation compared to its peers (AMZN, MSFT, AAPL, NVDA) won’t last forever. Given google is the most profitable business in the world, either the rest of the Mag 6 need to show growth rates significantly higher than google’s absurd pace to justify the 30-40% premium, or GOOG will need to show signs of slowing down. But that’s not what we’re seeing today, and I’m tired of pretending that GOOGL is at all “overvalued” due to the AI bubble.  it’s arguably the other way around.

23,GOOG,Daily GOOGLE GOON SQUAD: $GOOGL$ is the true AI king and it’s about to print,"Fellow Regards and Degenerates,

I'm here to tell you that $GOOGL / $GOOG is the most criminally undervalued stock in mega-cap tech because it’s the undisputed leader in the technologies that define the next century. Forget the short-term noise. This is a deep dive into the strategic moat that others can't even dream of crossing.

**1. Future of Tech**

**Waymo**

Google's Waymo is WAY MORE than a competitor. It's the only fully scaled, commercialized Level 4 self-driving service available to the public. It operates 24/7 robotaxi services in multiple major US cities like Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin and testing in other cities

In San Francisco, its massive surge in volume has already resulted in its market share surpassing Lyft's, making it the city's second-most popular ride-hailing service. It’s the result of a decade-plus of calm, deep-pocketed investment, allowing it to log over 100 million fully autonomous miles and complete over 10 million paid trips. 

The sheer mileage, the complexity of the scaled deployments—which have demonstrated an 80% reduction in injury-causing crashes compared to human drivers—and the fact that they are now expanding internationally to places like Tokyo and London is a moat that no other company has even come close to building. The heck, there is no second competition in autonomous self-driving.

  
**Quantum Leap for Humanity**

The recent quantum discovery by Google, featuring its Quantum Echoes algorithm, is a major step toward making quantum computers a practical, powerful tool. This breakthrough, which demonstrated verifiable quantum advantage on the Willow quantum chip, is set to accelerate scientific discovery across key industries.

Specifically, the ability to perform verifiable quantum advantage means we can now trust a quantum computer to reliably solve real-world physics problems that are computationally infeasible for classical machines.

What Quantum Echoes Will Do

This breakthrough directly accelerates the original promise of quantum computing:

* Design Better Drugs and Cures: The Quantum Echoes algorithm ran 13,000 times faster on Willow than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This technique—which is already being used in a quantum-enhanced version of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) to study molecular structure—will dramatically cut the time it takes to discover and develop new, more effective medicines by providing unprecedented insights into how potential drug compounds interact with disease targets.
* Create Advanced New Materials: The algorithm's power to reveal previously undetectable details about atomic interactions will unlock the discovery and design of novel materials. This is vital for creating the next generation of:
   * High-Performance Batteries (for electric vehicles and energy storage).
   * More Efficient Solar Cells.
   * Lighter, Stronger Polymers for manufacturing and aerospace.

In short, Google's Quantum Echoes is an engineering milestone that moves quantum computing from a theoretical concept to a practical, verifiable machine for solving humanity's hardest scientific problems.

Think of it this way - The average age of a few generations from now will be approximately 100 years. This is truly remarkable.

  
**AI: The Medical Revolution**

AI, particularly from Google DeepMind, is already achieving breakthroughs that save time, money, and lives. This is AI's immediate, profitable impact.

* AlphaFold &amp; Isomorphic Labs: AlphaFold, an AI model from DeepMind, solved the 50-year-old problem of protein folding. This monumental achievement earned Google DeepMind's Demis Hassabis and John Jumper a share of the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry (along with David Baker). In simple terms, proteins are the body's tiny machines. Knowing their 3D shape is the blueprint for creating drugs. AlphaFold can find that blueprint in minutes, a process that used to take years. Isomorphic Labs is now using this and other advanced AI to design new small-molecule drugs from scratch at ""digital speed,"" accelerating drug discovery from years to months.
* AI and Quantum Synergy: This is where the magic happens. AI (the brain) helps guide the ultra-powerful quantum computer (the brawn) by identifying which molecules to focus on and then analyzing the quantum simulation results. This hybrid approach makes breakthroughs possible that would be computationally impossible otherwise. Google is the only company with a dominant lead in *both* technologies.

  
**2. AI Supremacy: The Foundational Architect**

The current AI boom exists because of Google, and its competitive position is strong due to decades of strategic investment focused on making powerful technology affordable enough to scale effectively. By now, it is widely known that the foundational technology for modern AI—the Transformer architecture—was created by Google.

* Models: Leading Across the Modalities Google has established market-leading or top-tier models across text, image, and video.
   * Text &amp; Multimodal: The Gemini family of models sets the pace in multimodal reasoning, handling text, code, audio, and video inputs.
   * Image (Nano Banana/Imagen): The technology powering Nano Banana (Gemini 2.5 Flash Image) excels at enterprise-critical tasks like advanced editing that preserves character/product consistency across iterations—a crucial capability for marketing and design.
   * Video (Veo): Google's cutting-edge video generation models, like Veo, are rapidly advancing the state-of-the-art in creating high-quality, long-form video content.
* Infrastructure: The TPU Efficiency Moat Google designs its own custom AI chips, the Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), which are engineered for peak AI efficiency and low-cost operation. They have spent years perfecting this hardware because a tech needs to be affordable for it to scale and work. This commitment to efficiency is so superior that competitors, including major AI labs, must increasingly rely on the latest generations of Google's custom hardware by coming to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to train and run their own cutting-edge models. This external validation proves that Google's approach is about making large-scale AI economically sensible.

The Vertical Advantage:

Google is the only major company that is competing fiercely and winning or coming close to the top in every critical layer of the AI stack:

1. Infrastructure (TPUs): Competing directly with NVIDIA on highly efficient, specialized AI silicon.
2. Foundation Models (Gemini, Imagen, Veo): Competing with OpenAI/Microsoft and Anthropic on core intelligence.
3. Applications (Nano Banana, AI Overviews): Integrating AI features into products that serve billions of users globally.

This end-to-end control, from the silicon chip to the final consumer application, provides a powerful strategic and economic advantage that is unmatched in the industry.

  
**3. The ChatGPT Myth and Search Dominance**

The idea that chatgpt will kill Google Search is a false narrative. Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Reddit all were supposed to reduce google search queries. They have only grown. This new technology has made it much easier to ask any type or questions in any language. We were previously limited to what we would or could google. Now there are no limits. The more we know, the more questions we have and the more we search. Google search will be just fine.

I think ChatGPT will become another app on the phone where users will go to. I envision it as a personal assistant and less of search. But only time will tell.

Google was and will remain the gateway to the internet. The new AI business will be a net positive for Google by creating a new revenue stream through Google Cloud (GCP) and gemini features and subscriptions to its user base.

**4. The Financial Powerhouse and PE Hypothesis**

The fundamentals confirm this giant is firing on all cylinders.

* Net Income King: Alphabet's Trailing Twelve Months net income ending June 30, 2025, was $115.573 Billion, making it one of the most profitable companies in the world. This was more than MSFT $101.832 billion and APPL $99.280 billion
* Accelerating Triple-Threat Growth: All core segments - Google Cloud, Youtube and Google Search  are growing at double-digit rates.

The core reason Google's Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio is generally lower than many other tech companies is its revenue mix being heavily dominated by consumer advertising.

  
Simply put, investors are willing to pay a higher multiple (PE) for the more predictable, higher-margin, and rapidly growing recurring revenue streams typical of enterprise software and cloud platforms.

My hypothesis is with AI increasingly driving revenue through Google Cloud Platform (GCP), the enterprise segment will become a bigger component of Google's business mix, and hence, the company will earn a higher blended Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio. This is because Enterprise and Cloud businesses are valued more highly, providing predictable, high-margin, recurring subscription revenue (SaaS), a financial profile superior to advertising. As this higher-multiple segment captures a greater share of Google's overall profit, the market will be forced to re-rate $GOOGL with a higher blended multiple, making the current valuation—which is depressed by the ad-centric multiple look like a significant undervaluation and a compelling investment opportunity.

  
TLDR : GOOGL is a generational buy. You're buying the best-in-class *present* (Search/Maps/YouTube), the scaled *near-future* (Waymo/GCP), and the *long-term future* (Quantum/AI Core Tech) at a discount.

24,GOOG,🚛 Aurora Innovation (AUR): The Feds Just Fired the Starting Gun for Nationwide Driverless Trucking,"Position: 40,000 shares bought yesterday. My wife's boyfriend is pissed she doesn't have cash for luxury hotels anymore.

Alright you magnificent degenerates, put down your grape juice boxes and your wife's boyfriend’s homework. While you’ve been torching money on trash tickers, something foundational just shifted: Aurora Innovation (AUR) didn't just get a win; they got a clear signal from the federal government that the era of nationwide autonomous freight is coming. And Aurora, with its OEM kingmakers and 'superhuman' tech, is the only one with the keys to the kingdom.

On October 9, 2025, the Feds didn't just solve a small problem for Aurora. They showed their hand, revealing a clear intent to dismantle the single biggest obstacle to autonomous trucking: the dreaded ""patchwork"" of state-by-state regulations.

Part 1: The Triangle Problem Is Dead

Aurora runs Level 4 driverless trucks—freight runs, no human driver, no legally mandated breaks.

The catch? An old-school federal rule required a human driver to get out and place three reflective triangles if a truck stops on the roadside. With no driver, Aurora was in a legal catch-22.

This was a cornerstone of the bear case:

 * “The Feds will never adapt the rules for driverless.”

 * “A patchwork of 50 different state laws will kill them.”

 * “True commercialization is a fantasy.”

On Oct 9, the FMCSA dropped the hammer: triangles are out, automated beacons are in. This is possible because Aurora’s tech isn't just a gadget; it's a full-stack perception system. Their proprietary FirstLight LiDAR can spot a pedestrian on the highway at night up to 11 seconds sooner than a human driver. When your truck can see hazards over a quarter-mile away, the idea of needing a human to hop out and place triangles becomes absurd.

But here’s the kill shot: the waiver comes with federal preemption, meaning states are explicitly forbidden from enforcing conflicting rules on this issue. The Feds just drew a line in the sand.

Full details here: https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/safety/carrier-safety/carrier-safety-resources/waiver-warning-device-requirements-effective-october


Part 2: Aurora Didn’t Ask—They Fought and Won

This wasn't a gift. They forced the government's hand.

 * Dec 2024: FMCSA denies Aurora’s initial request, citing a lack of specifics. Bears pop the champagne.

 * Jan 2025: Aurora sues the Department of Transportation, calling the denial “arbitrary and capricious” and arguing it ""stifles innovation"".

 * Oct 2025: FMCSA reverses course, works with Aurora, and grants a new, specific waiver that creates a clear, data-driven path forward.

They proved that the federal government is no longer an immovable wall but a partner that can be compelled to find solutions for the autonomous age.


Part 3: Why This Is the First Domino to Fall for Patchwork Regulation

This is where you need to pay attention. This isn't just about triangles. This is a major strategic signal that the federal government is finally getting serious about creating a unified, national framework for autonomous vehicles.

Here’s why this is bigger than it looks:

 * Precedent is Set: For the first time on a critical operational issue, the Feds have used their preemptive power to tell states to stand down. They have established the principle that where a federal, data-backed solution for AVs exists, it will be the law of the land. This is the first shot fired in the war against the patchwork nightmare. And Aurora is the perfect company for the Feds to partner with on this. They aren't some fly-by-night startup. They have deep, co-development partnerships with PACCAR (Peterbilt, Kenworth) and Volvo, who together command roughly 50% of the entire U.S. Class 8 truck market. When the government wants to create a national standard, they work with the 800-pound gorillas, not the monkeys.

 * A Federal Playbook is Emerging: The FMCSA's reversal shows a clear path forward. They denied a vague, industry-wide request but approved a specific, technically rigorous, and safety-focused solution. This creates a template for solving other human-centric rules. The message is clear: bring us the data, and we will modernize the rules.

 * Executive Action Aligns with Legislative Intent: This waiver perfectly complements the ""America Drives Act,"" a federal bill currently being pushed that would create a unified nationwide framework for AVs. That bill’s goal is to explicitly preempt state laws that would prohibit driverless trucks based on the absence of a human driver. The FMCSA's action is a down payment on that goal. The executive branch is laying the groundwork and signaling its support while Congress works to make it permanent. The entire federal apparatus is starting to move in the same direction.

The bear case has always been that America’s fragmented regulatory system would strangle AV trucking in its crib. This waiver is the strongest evidence yet that the federal government recognizes that risk and is now actively working to mitigate it, creating a clear path for interstate commerce.


Part 4: Why the Stock Still Looks Stuck

So why isn’t the stock ripping? One word: Uber and its 🤡 financing deal.

Back in May, Uber raised $1.15B in exchangeable notes tied to its Aurora stake. Hedge funds bought them, then shorted AUR to hedge. Short interest exploded from ~89M shares in April to &gt;130M by May.

This isn’t “hedgies betting against Aurora.” It’s just 🤡 math. But the effect is the same: constant, price-insensitive selling pressure, driving down the stock anytime it nears around $8.50.

So we’ve got:

 * Fundamentals pointing to the moon → A landmark regulatory win that signals the beginning of the end for the patchwork problem.

 * Market mechanics pressing down → convert-arb shorts keeping the price stuck.

That’s why the stock looks flat even though the entire long-term thesis just got massively de-risked.


Part 5: The Bull Case - Why Aurora Owns the Road Ahead

So with the biggest regulatory threat neutralized, let's talk about why Aurora is set to dominate the now-open field.

 * The OEM Moat: Aurora’s strategy is a fortress. Their partnerships with PACCAR and Volvo aren’t just logos on a slide; they are deep, multi-year integrations to build autonomous-ready trucks from the factory floor up. A competitor can't just copy this. This creates a massive barrier to entry and a direct sales channel to half the industry.

 * The Competition is Dead: While Aurora was building this moat, the competition was self-destructing. TuSimple? Imploded in a storm of SEC investigations and shady dealings with China, delisted from NASDAQ, and is now pivoting to AI gaming tech. Embark? Ran out of money and shut down. Waymo? Alphabet's golden child deprioritized its trucking division to focus on robotaxis in cities and in the process is helping normalize vehicle autonomy to the public. And Kodiak, while alive, is a small private player with a fraction of Aurora’s miles, partners, and capital. They’re not a serious threat at national scale. Aurora is effectively the last scaled U.S. player standing. The field has been cleared and the reality of autonomous vehicles is rapidly being normalized.

 * The Tech Edge: Aurora’s 'Driver' is built around its proprietary FirstLight LiDAR, which has a range of over 450 meters—critical for stopping a fully-loaded 80,000-pound rig at highway speeds. This isn't just about staying in the lane; it's about superhuman perception that underpins their entire safety case.

 * The Multi-Billion Dollar Prize: So what’s the payoff? The realistic, serviceable market for long-haul autonomous trucking is estimated to be $44.5 billion annually by 2035. In the bull case, Aurora, with its OEM moat and cleared competitive field, could plausibly capture 25-50% of that. Let's run the numbers for you apes: a 25% share is over $11 billion in high-margin, recurring revenue. Slap a conservative 10x sales multiple on that (standard for a 'Driver as a Service' model), and you’re looking at a $111 billion market cap. From today’s $9.45 billion, that’s a 10-bagger, and that's not even the most optimistic scenario.

Conclusion: The Road Is Being Cleared
Aurora still has hurdles—scaling production with its OEM partners and proving the economics—but the single greatest strategic threat, a federal government unwilling to solve the state patchwork problem, is dissolving.

The fundamental bull case just got a massive injection of rocket fuel, but the price is still on the launchpad thanks to the short-sellers. And you know what that means for this rocket.

This isn’t financial advice (except for my wife's boyfriend). But if you’re looking for an asymmetric setup, this is it: the government is clearing the road, the competition has crashed and burned, and Aurora is leading the convoy with half the entire trucking industry riding shotgun. Strap yourself in and come along for the ride. 🚀",137,158,1761122761.0,2025-10-22T08:46:01+00:00,t3_1od2wys

26,GOOG,S&amp;P 100 Mean Reversion,"Hello everyone, So I have developed this means reversion logic which I have been using to take trades for quite some time. Logic is, I've been using volatility to calculate whether market is oversold or not if yes then I buy and exit on quick recovery. Now as per my experience trading this, on avg I get 7-8 trades per year on a single script with avg holding period of 10-12 days. So my time exposure to market is limited. Also I build own basket of stocks to trade this rather than trading on whole 100 stocks. I prefer to stick to large caps because that feels safer to me. And since not all stocks in my basket are active together - capital is not an issue.
I've attached a 1 year return as well as 3 year return for s&amp;p 100. Also shown how it looks on TV. I'm open for discussion!!

37,GOOG,Snap (SNAP): Acquisition Target or Dead Money?,"So Snap’s stock has been in free fall — down over 90% from the $80 peak in 2021, now sitting around $7. At the same time, the company still has ~469M daily active users, mostly Gen Z, who treat it like an operating system for their social life (AR lenses, Bitmoji, Maps, AI assistant, etc).

Here’s the case for why people think Snap is a buyout candidate:
	•	Valuation: Trading at one of the lowest price-to-sales multiples in social media. Dirt cheap compared to Meta, Pinterest, or TikTok’s implied value.
	•	User Base: Half a billion DAUs is nothing to sneeze at. Extremely sticky with younger demographics.
	•	Strategic Fit: Big tech (Google, Amazon, Apple, Disney, Netflix, etc) could bolt this onto their ecosystem. Rumors of Alphabet interest pre-IPO have floated before.
	•	Market Sentiment: Polls show a lot of retail/institutional investors believe Snap gets bought out in the next 1–2 years.

But here’s the catch:
	•	Founder Control: Evan Spiegel &amp; Bobby Murphy still hold ~96% of the voting power. If they don’t want to sell, it doesn’t matter how attractive the numbers look.
	•	Current Strategy: Snap’s been on offense, buying up smaller apps like Saturn (popular in U.S. high schools). That’s not what you do if you’re prepping for a sale.
	•	Execution Risk: Advertising headwinds, competition from TikTok/Instagram, and weak monetization continue to crush the stock.

TL;DR: On paper, Snap looks like one of the most attractive acquisition targets in tech cheap, highly engaged user base, potential fit for multiple buyers. But with founder control and ongoing internal growth moves, it’s far from a guaranteed outcome. If anything, it’s a speculative play on either a turnaround or someone eventually forcing their hand.

Not financial advice, just my two cents

39,GOOG,"Google cut 35% of small-team managers over past year, offers buyouts in 10 product areas","No paywall: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/27/google-executive-says-company-has-cut-a-third-of-its-managers.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/27/google-executive-says-company-has-cut-a-third-of-its-managers.html)

Google has eliminated more than one-third of its managers overseeing small teams, an executive told employees last week, as the company continues its focus on efficiencies across the organization.

“Right now, we have 35% fewer managers, with fewer direct reports” than at this time a year ago, said Brian Welle, vice president of people analytics and performance, according to audio of an all-hands meeting reviewed by CNBC. “So a lot of fast progress there.”

At the meeting, employees asked Welle and other executives about job security, “internal barriers” and Google’s culture after several recent rounds of layoffs, buyouts and reorganizations.

Welle said the idea is to reduce bureaucracy and run the company more efficiently.

“When we look across our entire leadership population, that’s managers, directors and VPs, we want them to be a smaller percentage of our overall workforce over time,” he said.

The 35% reduction refers to the number of managers who oversee fewer than three people, according to a person familiar with the matter. Many of those managers stayed with the company as individual contributors, said the person, who asked not to be named because the details are private.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai weighed in at the meeting, reiterating the need for the company “to be more efficient as we scale up so we don’t solve everything with headcount.”

Google eliminated about 6% of its workforce in 2023, and has implemented cuts in various divisions since then. Alphabet finance chief Anat Ashkenazi, who joined the company last year, said in October that she would push cost cuts “a little further.” Google has offered buyouts to employees since January, and the company has slowed hiring, asking employees to do more with less.

Regarding the buyouts, executives at the town hall said that a total of 10 product areas have presented “Voluntary Exit Program” offers. They’ve applied to U.S.-based employees in search, marketing, hardware and people operations teams this year. 

Fiona Cicconi, Google’s chief people officer, said at last week’s meeting that between 3% and 5% of employees on those teams have accepted the buyouts.

“This has been actually quite successful,” she said, adding “I think we can continue it.”

Pichai said the company executed the voluntary buyouts after listening to employees, who said they preferred that route to blanket layoffs.

“It’s a lot of work that’s gone into implementing the VEP program, and I’m glad we’ve done it,” Pichai said. “It gives people agency, and I’m glad to see it’s worked out well.”

‘Wanting a career break’

Cicconi said one of the main reasons employees are taking the buyouts is because they want to take time off from work.

“It’s actually quite interesting to see who’s taking a VEP, and it’s people sort of wanting a career break, sometimes to take care of family members,” she said.

CNBC previously reported that the layoffs hurt morale as the company was downsizing while at the same time issuing blowout earnings and seeing its stock price jump. Alphabet’s shares are up 10% this year after climbing 36% in 2024 and 58% the year prior.

At another point in the town hall, employees asked if Google would consider a policy similar to Meta’s “recharge,” a month-long sabbatical that employees earn after five years at the company.

“We have a lot of leaves, not least our vacation, which is there for exactly that — resting and recharging,” said Alexandra Maddison, Google’s senior director of benefits.

She said the company is not going to offer paid sabbatical.

“We’re very confident that our current offering is competitive,” Maddison said.

Meta didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Other executives jumped in to compare the two companies’ benefits.

“I don’t think they have a VEP at Meta by the way,” Cicconi said.

Pichai then asked, to some laughs from the audience, “Should we incorporate all policies of Meta while we’re at it? Or should we only pick and choose the few policies we like?”

“Maybe I should try running the company with all of Meta’s policies,” he continued. “No, probably not.”",970,106,1756565667.0,2025-08-30T14:54:27+00:00,t3_1n43n2j

42,GOOG,VSTM 🚀,"For you fellow regards who do not know how to do proper DD, let me introduce you to Verastem Oncology (VSTM). This biotech gem got a major win in May 2025 with FDA approval for its combo drug, Avmapki Fakzynja Co-pack (avutometinib and defactinib), targeting KRAS-mutated recurrent low-grade serous ovarian cancer (LGSOC). What you non-medical regards see as alphabet soup, I see as dollar signs.

Let me break down the future potential:

Since the FDA approval, VSTM’s stock hasn’t gotten the hype it deserves, considering everyone is overlooking their pipeline in pancreatic cancer and lung cancer. Their current approval will give them the runway to fuel these clinical trials to avoid future debt. The pricing for Avmapki Fakzynja is estimated at $20,000/month/patient, or $240,000/year/patient. The U.S. market for LGSOC is 6,000–8,000 patients. If Verastem captured every U.S. patient (unrealistic, but bear 🐻 with me), that’s $1.44–$1.92 billion in potential annual revenue. More conservatively, scaling to $400 million in sales is achievable, especially since there are zero competing targeted therapies for KRAS-mutated LGSOC, giving Verastem a first-mover edge.

Compare that to the current market cap, and the stock looks extremely undervalued. Verastem reported $2.1 million in Q2 2025 revenue just weeks after launch, showing early traction. Plus, they’re not stopping there. On July 24, 2025, Verastem scored FDA Fast Track Designation for VS-7375, an oral KRAS G12D inhibitor for pancreatic cancer, a massive market with 37% of cases carrying this mutation. Early trial data is promising, and they’re also exploring colorectal and lung cancer applications.

Yes I would buy more if I wasn't a brokie.

53,GOOG,Google’s AI Awakening: Earnings Bull Case,"# Beyond the AI hype, YouTube's dominance and a transforming Search business create a powerful, and potentially undervalued, growth story.

As Nvidia Corp. solidifies its position as a $4 trillion titan on the back of the AI hardware boom, a compelling debate is intensifying on Wall Street over what some see as a glaring valuation gap: Alphabet Inc., the parent company of Google.

While shares of the search giant have performed well, they have lagged the explosive, triple-digit gains of the companies building the ""picks and shovels"" of the AI revolution. This has led to a growing belief among some investors that Google, with its deeply integrated ""full stack"" of AI assets, is on the cusp of a significant re-rating. They are betting that the company’s upcoming second-quarter earnings report on July 23 will be the primary catalyst, forcing the market to shift its focus from the cost of Google's AI ambitions to the reality of its profits.

“For years, AI was a massive cost center for Google. The question for the second half of 2025 is whether it can become a massive profit center,” says one technology strategist. “Next week’s report is the first real test of that thesis.”

# The Unseen Competitor Winning the Streaming Wars

While investors have been fixated on Google's AI story, the recent earnings report from Netflix provided an inadvertent, and powerful, bull case for one of Google’s most valuable assets: YouTube.

Netflix’s management noted the intense competition for viewer engagement, and recent Nielsen data tells the story. In May, YouTube commanded 12.5% of all U.S. television screen time, significantly ahead of Netflix’s 7.5%. This data confirms that YouTube is not just a mobile video app, but the dominant media platform in the modern living room.

Financially, the scale is staggering. YouTube’s advertising revenue alone, at over $34 billion annually, is nearly the size of Netflix’s entire global enterprise. When combined with an estimated $19 billion in subscription revenue from YouTube Premium and YouTube TV, a hypothetical standalone “YouTube Inc.” would be a media behemoth with over $53 billion in annual sales, far outpacing its rivals.

“Netflix’s earnings call was inadvertently the best bull case for YouTube we’ve seen all year,” noted one portfolio manager. “It confirmed who truly owns the living room, and that value has yet to be fully unlocked in Alphabet’s stock price.”

# The Bear Case Reimagined: Search as an AI Utility

A persistent fear among investors has been that AI chatbots would cannibalize Google’s core Search business, which remains its primary source of profit. A contrarian view is now emerging, however, that AI will not be a threat, but rather Search's greatest accelerator.

This thesis posits that as Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI agents become more prevalent, they will need constant access to the live, indexed web to provide up-to-date, reliable information. The most efficient and trusted source for that data is Google's Search index.

Under this model, the biggest new customers for Google Search may not be humans, but other AIs. This could transform the Search business from a consumer-facing advertising platform into a foundational “Search as a Service” utility for the entire AI economy, monetized through high-margin, programmatic API access.

“The fear was that the search box would die,” says a tech strategist. “The reality may be that the underlying Search index becomes the foundational data layer for the entire AI ecosystem—a far more valuable position.”

# The Path to $3 Trillion

For Google to close the valuation gap with its peers, investors believe the market must recognize the value of its interconnected empire. A ""sum-of-the-parts"" analysis reveals immense potential: a dominant media company in YouTube, a profitable and growing Cloud business, and a portfolio of high-risk, high-reward ""Other Bets"" like the autonomous driving unit, Waymo.

The ultimate validation of its AI leadership could come from a partnership with its biggest rival. Persistent rumors of Apple integrating Google's Gemini into iOS for advanced AI tasks draw a direct parallel to the estimated $20 billion annual deal Google pays Apple for its search default status. Such a deal would instantly cement Gemini's position as the indispensable intelligence layer for the mobile world.

The narrative for the past year has rightfully celebrated the companies building the infrastructure for AI. The bull case for Google is a bet that the focus is about to shift to the companies that can most effectively monetize it. Investors will be watching closely on July 23rd for the answer.

  
**TL;DR:**

* **Google is likely undervalued.** The market has rewarded AI hardware companies like Nvidia but hasn't yet priced in Google's ability to profit from its ""full-stack"" AI ecosystem. The July 23rd earnings report is the key catalyst to prove this.
* **YouTube is quietly winning the streaming wars.** It has more viewing time than Netflix, making it a dominant media empire whose massive value is not fully reflected in Google's stock price.
* **The ""AI is a threat to Search"" narrative is likely wrong.** The opposite is more probable: AI agents will become massive new customers, using the Google Search index as the essential data layer for the entire AI economy, creating a new, high-margin business.
* **For the first time, real revenue from AI subscriptions (Gemini, Veo) will be reported.** This shifts the story from ""AI is an expense"" to ""AI is a profit engine.""
* **A potential multi-billion dollar deal for Apple to use Gemini** (similar to their current Search deal) is a massive, often overlooked catalyst that would cement Google's AI supremacy.

67,GOOG,why GOOGL (Alphabet) is a great buy right now,"With WWDC and the Robotaxi event next week, I'd like to discuss Google and its parent company Alphabet, they have been in trouble for a while now regarding some bullshit anti-trust cases, and I want to tell you why its pure FUD.  Google has really caught up with the rest of the Mag 7 giants in their AI advancements if you haven't noticed.  They have been doing AI machine learning since 2001.  Bard was unimpressive, but that was only little over a year ago.  The speed at which they have been making new advancements is almost hard to track (even across other LLM's).

Have you tried Gemini?  VEO 3 costs 250/m and people are loving it. (the rev. from that will be great as well) and the new AI mode for search seems to finally have been embraced and I think they can actually leverage AI to better serve people the right business ads / referrals.  ***Either way they are monetizing AI***\*...\*

Regarding all the FUD, I dont believe the judge can make them sell chrome, EU case is just stupid, the whole thing is about them having monopoly on search and ads...  well there is Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo, Perplexity, Meta / Instagram business Ads, etc..  they have no monopoly anymore if there was one...

I dont believe the cases will result in anything materially bad for the stock but nobody can be sure, so that is why I want to dig into the Fundmental and Technical Analysis.

# ----------- Fundamentals -----------

Alphabet is a massive conglomerate with many subsidiaries.  Lets talk about how they are competing and kicking ass in so many different industries.

\-

**AI:**  

*VEO 3, AI Mode, Gemini, DeepMind* \- Competing with GPT pro, Microsoft, etc.  (note VEO 3 is still the only model that does text to video PLUS audio.  I think they leveraged youtube for it.

**Data Centers / Internet Provider:**

\-----*Google Cloud, TPU's, Google Fiber* \-Competing with many, but their TPU's are very good for AI data centers, and google Fiber competes with internet / service providers like AT&amp;T / Comcast / T-Mobile, etc..

**Quantum Computing:**

\------Competing with Microsoft, IBM, Rigetti, etc.

**Smart Phones:**

\------*Android, Pixel Phone* (with Gemini that kicks Siri's ass) - competing with Apple big-time

**Streaming / Ads:**

\------*Youtube &amp; Google Ads* \- Competing with Meta and Netflix

**Smart Home / Wearables:**

\------*Nest, Fitbit,* &amp; ***XR Glasses*** \- Competing with Amazon, Apple's announced glasses and their 'watch', Microsoft, etc.

**Autonomous Driving / UAV Delivery:**

\------***Waymo, Wing*** \- Competing with Tesla (been kicking their ass on it for a while now), GM, and yes, Amazon Air delivery.  *They also just announced another partnership with Walmart to bring more drones to over 100 stores for deliveries!*

**AI in Healthcare / Biotech:**

\------*Verily, &amp; Calico* \- working on aging / genetics and ai in healthcare.

\-*and probably a few others i've missed..*.  but the scope of their work is clear.

\-

When you buy GOOGL you are buying the entirety of Alphabets investments.  And they are so well positioned from a fundamental and financial perspective as seen in this group of charts.  They make double nearly double the revenue of Nvidia...

[Google makes more revenue than the rest of the Mag 7, nearly double Nvidia's earnings!  the only exception of Apple which could be in jeopardy too if they dont continue to innovate.](https://preview.redd.it/i61ok3bywl5f1.png?width=1183&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab383da02f61b9d5fdc7bb71ce2bde6c7d453ac2)

\-

Yet oddly, Google has the lowest P/E (price to earnings) ratio than the rest of the Mag 7!  That seems off if you ask me.  I believe they can take plenty of market share back in the future based on these 2 figures.

https://preview.redd.it/a61jyxhzwl5f1.png?width=1125&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b85188b91cd7b2b6b95516e18513586d86d630b

\-

# -------- Technical Analysis --------

so now lets look at the Chart!  Because Price Action Speaks more than anything else...

I like to use Multiple Timeframes for analysis so here I have the 4 hour, daily, and weekly charts.

I know there are a lot of lines and colors, dont be scared.  The indicators I use are patterns combined with price action, fib levels, TTM squeeze, RSI and some other factors such as price gaps.

\- With RSI, above/below the 50 line tells you if momentum is bullish or bearish.  All the higher timeframes are above that 50 line indicating a potential bullish reversal.

\- With TTM it makes it easier to visualize these momentum shifts.  Right now my focus is on that Weekly chart on the bottom right - higher time frames are usually more important and it appears to be on the verge of a weekly breakout.  Now with a stock like this it could take months to reach that earnings Gap and make a new all time high.  When or If this happens depends on a lot of factors, but I am only focusing on the chart.

\- The Fibonacci Retracements I mostly use for the 50% line to determine if the price has had a change of trend.  Right now the price is attempting a breakout above this retracement and if it can break over 175 then there is plenty of room up.

\- Ive also illustrated some patterns and concepts on the chart.  Inverted Head and Shoulders, Trendline Break, Higher Highs and Higher Lows, potentially an even larger inverted H&amp;S on the daily chart to the top right.

https://preview.redd.it/d2fprue33m5f1.jpg?width=3676&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77f0a1e390e7b81ec6f893f6f38220ffc3fde21f

Ok so what does this technical analysis mumbo jumbo mean?  Its hard to say because of Trump, Tarrifs, Deals, Interest Rates, Bonds, Geopolitics, the fact that the market has already just about reached all time highs and this is lagging...  it is concerning.  It could also just be setting up for a massive (bearish) head and shoulders as you might notice on the bottom right weekly chart.

But with WWDC, RoboTaxi, and several trump deals supposedly taking place next week, we could be setup for some bullish continuation if these tech events impress.  Either way, Long Term I believe Google / Alphabet stock will get back to 200.

From a technical and fundamental perspective they are in great shape.  I would even bet that if the market pulls back, that institutions may rotate their Mag 7 holdings into the laggards such as this and Amazon.

While they are aggressively competing with so many different companies and industries, their earnings are expected to continue to grow and as you saw earlier, they earn double what Nvidia earns... Pelosi still has calls, and lets face it, you still use some kind of google product in your life whether its youtube, your android based phone, ai / gemini research, waymo, etc...  I believe Google is well positioned to be a winner this year in AI and many of its subsidiary company products.

\--------------

# TLDR:

**Alphabet is a great Bet !**

I currently am selling put credit spreads on GOOGL, and have several 180 calls for 7/18 that I only plan to hold through next week before I re-enter as there is going to be a lot going on next week for the markets.  Their earnings are on 7/22 I believe, so August may be a better strike date.  Shares or LEAPS (calls dated atleast for 2026) are also a good idea IMO, you can sell calls against them to hedge when there are large spikes.

**Anyway, I am highly regarded** ***and this is not financial advice,*** but I am very bullish on Google long term.  Its not an easy one to trade if you like short dated options, you need patience, but the chart, the p/e ratios, the incredible amount of subsidiaries competing with more than other Mag 7 companies makes this thing a highly undervalued growth &amp; value stock.

*Price Target short term - 180*

*Price Target long term - 200+*

68,GOOG,Google's search share falls below 90% - is AI the new king of search?,"Looks like the *innovators dilemma* is finally catching up with Google. After a decade of near-absolute dominance, its grip on the global search market is finally showing real cracks.   
Google’s global search share dropped to 89%, marking the first sustained dip below 90% since 2015.  
This isn’t just a blip. For past year it has hovered in the under 90% range, signaling a real trend as users shift their habits. What is driving this change?

**Users want answers, not ads pretending to be answers**  

**Users want real solutions to complex problems, not blue links**  

**People are done scrolling through SEO sludge and digging through link farms. Just get straight to the point dammit!**

*Clayton Christensen’s* theory of disruptive innovation is highly relevant to Google’s current situation and Google knows it. The theory highlights that disruption thrives when new entrants redefine value propositions. Google’s creation of Alphabet in 2015 exemplifies a structural solution to this dilemma. By splitting into autonomous subsidiaries (e.g., Waymo, Verily, DeepMind), Google insulated disruptive projects from the financial pressures of its core search business, allowing them to experiment with moonshot ideas without immediate ROI expectations. They tried very hard.....but the gig is up!

A couple of decades ago, when browsers were still relevant, Microsoft won the browser wars but were disrupted by Google which redefined search as the starting value proposition for the internet. Now the AI native competitors - think Perplexity, ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Grok etc - are gaining traction at a very high speed.

The stock price is where it was over a year ago. Even after the recent rally, it is still trading below the 55 &amp; 200 day averages on the daily chart. And there is a bearish RSI divergence on the weeklies. 

AI search is eating Google's lunch. Thoughts?

69,GOOG,NVIDIA Artificial Intelligence,"Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA)) has outperformed every stock in the S&amp;P 500 ([\^GSPC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC)) since [the launch of ChatGPT ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/how-chatgpt-changed-the-world-of-tech-in-just-one-year-180957543.html)in late November 2022 Shares in the chipmaker have risen nearly 700% since ChatGPT brought the power of artificial intelligence to the masses, far outpacing the S&amp;P 500's roughly 45% over the same time period. The next closest gain for an S&amp;P 500 company in that time period is a 540% pop for Vistra Corp ([VST](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VST)).Nvidia has established itself as the key provider of chips needed to operate AI systems. Now at the epicenter of an AI arms race, Nvidia has established itself as[ a cornerstone of the recent bull market](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/live/stock-market-today-tech-leads-stocks-higher-as-nvidia-surges-to-record-high-175727614.html) in stocks as the company's sales and profits have skyrocketed over the past several years.

Ahead of the [company's next quarterly earnings release on May 28](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-to-report-q1-earnings-as-middle-east-deals-export-control-reprieve-boost-stock-122728218.html), we broke down some of the most eye-popping charts that show how Nvidia became one of the most-followed stocks in the market.There's perhaps no clearer way to see how Nvidia ran away from the competition in the AI boom than looking at the company's market capitalization against its peers. Back when ChatGPT launched, Nvidia had a market cap of just over $400 billion. It's now over $3.3 trillion. Over that same time period, chip competitor Intel's ([INTC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/INTC)) market cap has actually decreased, while Advanced Micro Devices' ([AMD](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMD)) market cap has increased incrementally from $125 billion to $177 billion.Nvidia's rise proved to be at the center of a new technological boom. Combined with Nvidia, the rise in dominance of six other companies — Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)), Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL), [GOOG](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG)), Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)), Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)), Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)), and Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)) — formed what would come to be known as the [""Magnificent Seven.""](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/one-chart-shows-how-the-magnificent-7-have-dominated-the-stock-market-in-2023-203250125.html)

The group began the AI boom with a combined market cap just shy of $7 billion. Now, two and a half years later, the Big Tech group's market cap is worth over $16.8 trillion. The seven companies have grown from about 22% of the S&amp;P 500's market cap in November 2022 to 32% of the index's market cap today.Given the outsized weighting in the S&amp;P 500, large swings in shares of Nvidia have become a feature of how even broad market investors are thinking about the direction of stocks. In June 2024,[ three Wall Street strategists boosted their year-end S&amp;P 500 targets](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-enthusiasm-prompts-3-wall-street-banks-to-raise-stock-market-forecasts-100027154.html), citing better-than-expected consistent performance among key AI players.

As of May 19, the Magnificent Seven have accounted for about 52% of the S&amp;P 500's gain since Nov. 30, 2022. Nvidia alone has contributed 17.21%, by far the most among the group, with the next closest stock, Microsoft, which has added about 8.8%.Nvidia's stock hasn't been rising from just hype. The company's quarterly financial metrics have soared. In the quarter ChatGPT launched, Nvidia posted revenue of $6.3 billion. Two years later, it would post revenue of $35.3 billion. That's a 460% increase in sales in two years. As seen in the chart below, the main source of growth for Nvidia has been its data center revenue segment, which includes the sales of its AI chips.

From the company's fourth quarter of 2023 to its final quarter of its 2025 reporting period, data center revenue grew almost 900%.

Nvidia's data center revenue particularly stands out when considering its rise against peers in the industry. In the final quarter of 2024, Nvidia notched a record $35.58 billion in just data center revenue, up from $3.62 billion in the final quarter of 2022.

In comparison, Alphabet's data center revenue increased to $11.96 billion, ending 2024 up from $7.32 billion in the final quarter of 2022.

71,GOOG,Warby Parker pops 16% on $150 million Google smart glasses partnership,"No paywall: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/20/warby-parker-google-glasses-xr.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/20/warby-parker-google-glasses-xr.html)

Warby Parker shares surged 15.6% after Google announced a smart glasses partnership at the tech company’s annual I/O developer conference.

Google has committed up to $150 million as part of the agreement. The company has put $75 million into product development costs and will invest as much as an additional $75 million into the glasses company if Warby meets “certain collaboration milestones,” the companies announced.

Warby Parker said it plans to launch a series of smart glasses with Google, with the first line of products set to arrive sometime “after 2025.” The glasses will be built on top of Google’s Android XR, an operating system for headset computers. Android XR will include Google’s Gemini AI assistant that users can speak with to control their device.

“We know that these need to be stylish glasses that you’ll want to wear all day,” said Shahram Izadi, Google’s vice president and general manager of Android XR, at the I/O keynote. “We want you to be able to wear glasses that match your personal taste.”

The Warby Parker and Google alliance will rival that of the partnership between Facebook-parent Meta and EssilorLuxottica, the maker of Ray-Ban. Meta and Luxottica in 2023 launched the second edition of their smart glasses, and the two companies are set to roll out a third generation of the glasses with a small display, CNBC previously reported. Meta first announced the partnership in 2020.

The partnership with Warby Parker is also a return to the world of glasses for Alphabet. The company famously launched its futuristic Google Glass device in 2013, but the product drew privacy concerns.

Besides Warby Parker, Google on Tuesday said it will partner with developers and device makers for Android XR, including Samsung, Qualcomm, Sony, Xreal, Magic Leap, Gentle Monster and others.",137,53,1747777209.0,2025-05-20T21:40:09+00:00,t3_1krh0vi

75,GOOG,"Google Charizard TA Analysis - Flamethrower and Dragon Dance Detected, $185+ Breakout","HERE IS MY NEW ANALYSIS EVERYONE HAS BEEN WAITING FOR.  
  
Over the last few weeks… bruh... Google has been **DRAGON DANCING**. Sacrificing short-term gains to buff its *long-term attack and movement speed stats*.

Like my analysis on hims, Charizard earlier was doing premature flamethrowers, unable to impress the other step-dragons because of it's lack of fore, I mean preparation. That’s right. Not consolidating. Not pulling back. **CHARGING. ITS. STATS.**  
  
This is shown by the wiggles downward from the 1W candles. But this isn’t weakness — it’s a *setup*. Because of this, Google stock will do 1.5X the gains and 1.5X movement after casting DRAGON DANCE TWICE for a total of 3x gains, 3x speed in total.

Now here’s where it gets 🔥**SERIOUS**🔥:

At $157, the chart shows **resistance forming a textbook Metapod Cluster Formation** — known for attempting to **Harden** and slow bullish momentum.

BUT…

**CHARIZARD HAS FULLY FORMED ON THE CHART.** **FULLY FKING ERECT.**  
  
That means Google stock will use FLAMETHROWER at the $157 resistance along with the 3X speed and damage from Dragon Dance to burn that past the bearish METAPODS who try hardening at that price.

For this very reason, I bought $100k in Google 2026 Calls. Fire-breathing dragon with 3x buffs isn't just Bullish like a Taurus or Bearish like an Usurang— it’s LITERALLY A LEVEL 100 DRAGON THAT WILL 1 SHOT ANYTHING IN ITS WAY, so DRAGONISH.   
  
**🌀 TLDR: Dragon Dance has been used TWICE. Google will use Flamethrower at $157.  CHARZARD FULLY ERECT ON CHART, EYES GLOWING TAIL BLAIZING. Google $200 imminent.**

Apple Inc. is “actively looking at” reshaping the Safari web browser on its devices to focus on AI-powered search engines in light of the potential collapse of its Google deal and broader industry shifts. 

Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of services, made the disclosure Wednesday during his testimony in the US Justice Department’s lawsuit against Alphabet Inc.

78,GOOG,Snap Inc. (SNAP) vs. The Big Players: Who’s Worth More Per User and Per Ad Dollar?,"Yo, bros. So I’ve been looking into Snap’s stock lately and wanted to see how it stacks up against the big dogs like Meta, Google, and TikTok. I thought it’d be cool to break it down by market cap per active user and market cap per ad dollar to see how much each company is really worth compared to the number of users they’ve got and how much money they’re making.

Let’s dive in.

1. Market Cap Per Active User

How much is each active user worth to these companies? Here’s the breakdown:

Snap Inc.
	•	Market Cap: $13.5 billion
	•	Active Users (DAU): ~460 million
Market Cap per User:
\frac{13,500,000,000}{460,000,000} = 29.35 \, \text{USD per user}

Meta (Facebook/Instagram)
	•	Market Cap: $1.45 trillion
	•	Active Users (DAU): ~2.96 billion
Market Cap per User:
\frac{1,450,000,000,000}{2,960,000,000} = 490.54 \, \text{USD per user}

Alphabet (Google/YouTube)
	•	Market Cap: $1.88 trillion
	•	Active Users (DAU): ~2 billion
Market Cap per User:
\frac{1,880,000,000,000}{2,000,000,000} = 940 \, \text{USD per user}

TikTok (ByteDance)
	•	Market Cap: Not public, but around $300 billion
	•	Active Users (DAU): ~1 billion
Market Cap per User:
\frac{300,000,000,000}{1,000,000,000} = 300 \, \text{USD per user}

⸻

2. Market Cap Per Ad Dollar

Now let’s look at how much market cap each company has for every dollar they make from ads. It shows how efficiently they’re turning their user base into money.

Snap Inc.
	•	Annual Ad Revenue: ~$4.6 billion (2023)
	•	Market Cap: $13.5 billion
Market Cap per Ad Dollar:
\frac{13,500,000,000}{4,600,000,000} = 2.93 \, \text{USD per ad dollar}

Meta Platforms
	•	Annual Ad Revenue: ~$117 billion (2023)
	•	Market Cap: $1.45 trillion
Market Cap per Ad Dollar:
\frac{1,450,000,000,000}{117,000,000,000} = 12.39 \, \text{USD per ad dollar}

Alphabet (Google)
	•	Annual Ad Revenue: ~$285 billion (2023)
	•	Market Cap: $1.88 trillion
Market Cap per Ad Dollar:
\frac{1,880,000,000,000}{285,000,000,000} = 6.60 \, \text{USD per ad dollar}

TikTok (ByteDance)
	•	Annual Ad Revenue: ~$18 billion (2023)
	•	Market Cap: $300 billion
Market Cap per Ad Dollar:
\frac{300,000,000,000}{18,000,000,000} = 16.67 \, \text{USD per ad dollar}

⸻

3. Key Takeaways
	•	Snap is the cheapest per user ($29.35) and per ad dollar ($2.93). This could mean the stock is undervalued if you think they can better monetize their user base.
	•	Meta and Alphabet are much more expensive per user ($490.54 and $940) and per ad dollar (12.39 and 6.60). These companies are huge and are dominating the ad space, but they also have a lot more competition.
	•	TikTok is somewhere in the middle for both, with a decent per-user valuation of $300 but a much higher price per ad dollar ($16.67), showing they still have a lot to prove when it comes to monetizing.

⸻

Final Thoughts:
	•	Snap’s low valuation might make it look like a good deal if you think they can capitalize on their young, engaged user base and start pulling in more ad revenue. Their AI and AR tech could be the key to unlocking this.
	•	Meta and Google are solid bets, but they’re already at massive valuations, so growth might be slower unless they really innovate.
	•	TikTok is the wild card here, with rapid growth but a lot of unknowns around how sustainable that will be.

What do you guys think? Does Snap look like a bargain with its low per-user valuation, or is the market right to be cautious? Would love to hear your thoughts!

79,GOOG,Nasdaq Plan Will Bring Zero-Day Option Boom Closer to Single Stocks,"This summary is for people that can't/won't read the article:

1. **Nasdaq's Proposal**: Nasdaq plans to expand weekly expirations for options on select stocks to include Mondays and Wednesdays in addition to Fridays. This change, pending SEC approval, is expected to start trading by the first half of 2026.
2. **Expanding 0DTE Options**: This move aims to bring the popular zero-day trading boom—currently focused on major indexes like the S&amp;P 500—to individual stocks. It will allow investors to better manage portfolios and risks.
3. **Criteria for Stocks**: Only stocks with a minimum market capitalization of $700 billion and ETFs with a net asset value above $50 billion will qualify for these additional expirations. Companies like Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, and others meet these criteria.
4. **Challenges with Single-Stock Options**: Unlike index options, single-stock options are typically physically settled, adding risks for retail traders. Nasdaq proposes avoiding expirations coinciding with company earnings to reduce such risks.
5. **Market Potential**: While untested, demand for single-stock 0DTE options is expected to be high, based on strong trading volumes for single-stock options and investor enthusiasm.",251,94,1746108683.0,2025-05-01T14:11:23+00:00,t3_1kc9pfk

83,GOOG,Everything about Google's earnings tonight,"Alphabet reports first-quarter earnings after today's closing bell. They're the second earnings report among the Magnificent Seven stocks which I'll be posting about on each of their earning days. Alphabet is following Tesla, which, despite disappointing results, gained after news of Elon Musk's increased involvement in the company's operations. 

So for GOOG, are we going in on calls or puts? I figured we'd at least need to be informed with what's in the know before deciding. In light of the widespread weakness among leading Big Tech companies (all of these companies have experienced higher declines than the broader US market since the beginning of the year), today's Alphabet earnings will be a significant test of how the company operates in a new environment dominated by uncertainty. I'm not only going to be interested in the financial data but I wanna see the message from the management indicating to investors whether Alphabet is navigating safely through our currently uncertain market.

**The Chart**

From a [TA perspective](https://i.imgur.com/uE3nJVz.png) a double bottom pattern may be forming on Alphabet's chart. If today's earnings results turn out to be a positive surprise and the stock price climbs above the $160.77 level, it could signal a reversal of the downward trend that has been affecting the tech giant's shares since the beginning of 2025. 

**Earnings**

For Q1, it looks like the market is expecting Alphabet to report revenue of $89.1 billion (+11% y/y). From what I've read, operating income is expected to reach $28.58 billion (+12% y/y). This stronger profit growth implies a slight margin improvement to above 32.08% (+0.45 pp). Tbh, it looks like effective cost management will be one of the biggest challenges for Alphabet in this environment. While sustaining strong revenue growth seems less at risk, managing expenses (especially given capital-intensive AI development plans) will be challenging.

**Cloud Services**

For those who are aware, Google Cloud is a thing and is driving massive growth for the company. With rivals signaling a slowdown in data center expansion amid rising uncertainty, Alphabet may either follow a cautious strategy (likely dampening growth) or seize the opportunity to gain market share by acting aggressively.

The second approach would be riskier and more costly, potentially causing erosion in the segment’s operating margin. It would, however, be an investment in the better future market position.

I'm going to be watching not just the quarterly results but also the forward outlook and management’s tone regarding the Cloud business. It looks like the Forecasted Cloud segment has a revenue of $12.32 billion for Q1 2025. This would be the h[ighest quarterly result in Alphabet's history](https://i.imgur.com/9uWUntD.png). However, operating income is expected to slightly decline versus the prior quarter, but at $1.94 billion it would still be over twice the result from Q1 2024.

**Tariffs** 

One of the key topics that I'll especially be closely watching tonight is the impact of tariffs and macroeconomic uncertainty on the company’s operations. Among the major Big Tech companies, Alphabet has shown the greatest resilience to potential geopolitical turmoil and has often demonstrated the fastest recovery following periods of uncertainty.

At this point, they do not appear to be in significantly better shape than its peers, with its stock down approximately 17% year-to-date, placing it squarely in the middle of the Magnificent Seven stocks.

I think the first step toward rebuilding investor confidence will be outlining the scope and impact of tariffs and overall geopolitical uncertainty on the company’s operations. As such, the types of questions I expect during today’s conference about how strongly tariffs will affect Alphabet’s business. It is worth noting that this isn’t necessarily about the direct impact (which is likely to be limited) but rather the indirect effect of uncertainty on the willingness of Alphabet’s clients to spend on advertising, which constitutes a significant portion of the company’s revenue.

**Price Targets**

Amid these earnings expectations, analysts have been revising Alphabet's price targets downward. Over the past few weeks, [several top analysts have revised their 12-month price targets for Alphabet](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/goog/forecast?utm_source=theglobeandmail.com&amp;utm_medium=referral). TD Cowen lowered its target from $210 to $195. UBS cut its target from $209 to $173. Even Scotiabank lowered its target from $232 to $200. Despite that, they all still rate GOOG stock as a Buy, showing they believe in its long-term value.

Guggenheim lowered its target from $215 to $190, while Jefferies adjusted its target from $235 to $200, both maintaining a Buy rating. Piper Sandler and Citi followed suit, reducing their targets to $185 and $195 respectively, citing uncertainties in the advertising landscape and macroeconomic pressures.

I mean. With all things considered, the stock is down 19% in 2025 so far. Combine that with rising legal risks (mentioned later here) and an uncertain economy, and you have a good reason to reframe expectations. Analysts aren’t necessarily predicting more downside; they’re just being more realistic about the upside, especially in the near term.

If we’re to simplify the analysts’ overall message, it’s that Alphabet’s fundamentals are strong, but the road ahead could be bumpy.

**In the news**

A federal court recently ruled that Google violated antitrust laws by monopolizing specific digital advertising markets. The court plans to determine suitable remedies soon. Some analysts believe the ruling could eventually lead to the divestiture of certain Google ad segments, though the financial impact on Alphabet is expected to be modest.

There’s also the bigger picture. Between global tariffs, economic uncertainty, and shifts in labor and costs across the tech industry, Alphabet has a lot on its plate. Investors will want to hear how the company manages expenses, hiring, and regional exposure.

**Mergers and Acquisitions**

Alphabet announced a $32 billion all-cash deal to acquire cloud security platform Wiz. This acquisition aims to enhance Google Cloud’s security capabilities and multi-cloud operations. Analysts are projecting long-term benefits from this acquisition, despite potential short-term market pressures on other cloud service providers.

Separately, Google has decided to maintain its current approach to offering third-party cookie choices in its Chrome browser, emphasizing the importance of online privacy and user control. This decision is part of Google's ongoing Privacy Sandbox initiative, which aims to strengthen online privacy while supporting a sustainable ad-driven internet environment.

**What now?**

Alphabet’s stock may be down, but most analysts still believe it’s a long-term winner. That’s why Buy ratings remain steady, even if price targets are down. Q1 earnings could be the reset moment Alphabet needs to win back momentum. I'm thinking short term puts for earnings but holding long term shares. Could even sell covered calls for earnings for some extra income, if you already have the shares. Avg price target is $204.",251,101,1745521349.0,2025-04-24T19:02:29+00:00,t3_1k70ero

85,GOOG,Nvidia CEO Says He Was Surprised That Publicly Held Quantum Firms Exist,"(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said he didn’t realize there were publicly traded quantum-computing companies when he made earlier comments that caused industry stocks to crash.

“My first reaction was, I didn’t know they were public. How can a quantum company be public?” Huang said at an event Thursday focused on the still-nascent technology.

The executive had said in January that “very useful” quantum computers are probably decades away, causing shares of IonQ Inc. and other companies to tumble. Thursday’s event — part of Nvidia’s weeklong GTC conference — invited some of those very companies on stage to discuss their prospects with Huang.

The quantum-computing industry aims to use the unique properties of subatomic particles to process data much faster than traditional semiconductor-based electronics. The technical difficulties of building practical systems have meant that the field is still in an experimental stage. In addition to quantum upstarts, companies such as Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google are also trying find practical uses for quantum systems.

The companies on stage at Thursday’s event included IonQ and D-Wave Quantum Inc. Huang said it was natural for this new form of computing to take many years to develop since it was so novel. The companies might be able to convince him that quantum computing is happening more quickly than he expected, he said. “But I don’t know,” he joked.

“This whole session is going to be like a therapy session for me,” he said.

The six company leaders on stage gave him a variety of answers. Some argued that quantum computers are already in use to solve difficult science problems. Others posited that the technology is even closer to helping advance traditional computing.

Executives also said it wasn’t unreasonable to spend a decade honing a technology that will have such a large impact. Loic Henriet, who runs the French company Pasqal, argued that the term “quantum computing” was misleading. Quantum processors will help act as accelerators — working alongside traditional computers — rather than replacing them, he said.

86,GOOG,Lyft to Offer Driverless Ride-Hails ‘as Soon as This Summer’,"(Bloomberg) -- Lyft Inc. said it plans to offer driverless vehicles on its platform “as soon as this summer,” and that it sees human drivers transitioning to other work such as fleet management as autonomous rides become more ubiquitous.

The company has been spending more time pitching its vision for the future of its gig-economy business model as it plays catch-up in offering autonomous rides. Driverless ride-hailing has become more commonplace in some key US markets through competing platforms. Like rival Uber Technologies Inc., Lyft envisions a hybrid future where human drivers will complement autonomous vehicle fleets, especially during periods of peak demand.

The autonomous-vehicle economy will create new jobs such as remote vehicle support, fleet management, and map data labeling and validation, said Jeremy Bird, Lyft’s executive vice president in charge of driver experience, said Thursday in a blog post. He also confirmed the driverless service could begin as early as this summer. The company had previously committed to a launch sometime in 2025.

Bird also said the idea of drivers eventually owning autonomous vehicles is core to the company’s strategy, and this will become more feasible as the cost falls for those cars. That would enable drivers to operate small fleets, not unlike how some Airbnb Inc. hosts have made a business out of renting out multiple properties. Elon Musk has a similar vision in which Tesla owners would monetize their vehicles when they aren’t personally using them.

“Even when technology encroaches on human jobs, it doesn’t eliminate the need for humans altogether — especially when workers can provide value that the machines cannot,” Bird wrote. “Humans are features, not bugs, and we’ll continue to find a way to reward those that provide great service as part of a thriving hybrid network.”

Lyft and Uber currently rely on millions of drivers to quickly match with riders. But Lyft, which only operates in the US and Canada, is more exposed to increasing competition from domestic autonomous ride providers such as Alphabet Inc.’s Waymo.

Waymo began offering driverless service more broadly in major markets like San Francisco and Los Angeles last year, and has partnered exclusively with Uber to offer those rides in Austin starting this month. The two companies have a similar agreement to launch driverless trips in Atlanta this summer.

When Lyft launches its first driverless trips, it will be through existing partnerships, including with Toyota Motor Corp.-backed startup May Mobility in Atlanta.

Lyft shares have declined 9% since the start of the year, while Uber’s have gained 23% so far.

Uber Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi has gone so far as to predict that human drivers will eventually be displaced as autonomous software develops superior driving skills over the next 15 to 20 years. The company has made some early efforts to help create new earnings opportunities for its network of gig workers, including piloting a Taskrabbit-like service where customers can hire people to complete various household tasks. It’s also recruiting coders and language experts to fuel its new AI data labeling business.

In his blog post, Lyft’s Bird stopped short of predicting when drivers might be displaced, instead saying that driverless cars will create new opportunities for drivers. That includes manual work required to service, maintain and charge the vehicles. These are “jobs for which drivers are well suited,” Bird added.

The industry will also need customer service workers to respond to unusual events during driverless rides. In Lyft’s case, 30% of the staff working in its fleet management unit Flexdrive are former or current Lyft drivers, Bird wrote.

The company has also proposed ways for drivers to find jobs in other industries, offering free training to enter the tech industry. CEO David Risher also recently announced a new feature that uses AI to generate a recommendation letter, which active drivers in good standing can share with potential employers.",130,40,1742496624.0,2025-03-20T18:50:24+00:00,t3_1jfwcij
87,GOOG,AI trade simply out of juice or starting to deflate?,"The S&amp;P 500 has had a stellar run for the past couple of years, adding roughly $19T from the ChatGPT moment (Nov '22) to the DeepSeek event (Jan '25). I ran some back of the envelope calculations and, by my estimate, at least half of that is AI-driven!

By AI-driven, I’m referring to two key contributors:

1. First, the ""picks and shovels"" plays in AI data centers, which contributed $4.5 trillion (24% of the S&amp;P's gains), with NVDA leading the charge, accounting for 69% (nice) of this group's gains. While in my table I’ve focused on some of the major players in this space, it's likely I've left out many others, meaning these figures almost certainly underestimate the full impact.
2. Second, the rest of the Magnificent 7, which have benefited in various ways from the AI narrative, added an additional $5.2 trillion (27% of the S&amp;P's gains).

Now, the big question is: Is the AI trade simply losing some juice, or are we witnessing the start of a full-blown reversal? Since the DeepSeek event, these names have collectively shed $1.3 trillion, suggesting the latter might not be easily dismissed.

What does this mean for the S&amp;P going forward? The rest of the pack will have to pick up the slack if we are to see some gains this year, and that is without even considering the big R word.

Edit: figured out how to add the image.

92,GOOG,Nancy Pelosi NEW $GOOGL Position 🗞️,"
Nancy Pelosi’s financial disclosure report shows she purchased 50 call options on Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) with a $150 strike price, expiring in January 2026. The transaction, valued between $250,001 and $500,000, suggests a bullish stance on Google’s stock price.

Possible Short-Term Impact on GOOGL:

94,GOOG,Why Estimates For NVIDIA's Q4 Revenue Could Be Dead Wrong: The Case for NVIDIA's Next Blowout Report,"TL;DR: Estimating NVIDIA's Q4 FY2025\* revenue from the capex of its four largest customers using linear regression results in an estimated revenue that is significantly higher than Wall Street's expectations.

*\*Note: Although it may sound confusing, NVIDIA is in fiscal year 2025 and will report its* [*Q4 FY2025 results on February 26, 2025*](https://investor.nvidia.com/events-and-presentations/events-and-presentations/default.aspx)*.*

*This is the author’s opinion only, not financial advice, and is intended for entertainment purposes only. The author holds a beneficial long position in NVIDIA Corporation. The author receives no compensation for writing this article and has no business relationship with any of the companies mentioned. The following analysis has been carefully conducted, but numbers or calculations may be incorrect, leading to potentially incorrect results.*

NVIDIA will report its Q4 FY2025 financial results on February 26. The consensus estimate for NVIDIA's Q4 revenue is [$38.13 billion](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA/analysis/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAANOTJUpcAKXWdLKLCN4HDOw3xKM2mpDinXbx-3Ru72Xm5RtzQ8Qf0ruVaAPw61jJOwPbZHkqX9X2SRQvZJqafxEFMyTmQoFXdmxWLKJ-26YBEwQoOy5EcgpCEHOlmOzeyyZXGeSD-90RiaVAj_H8nFt0DtbA37mKFQUC-eGlN5tA). In the past two weeks, Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon, NVIDIA's largest customers, have reported earnings. [One of the biggest headlines](https://www.ft.com/content/634b7ec5-10c3-44d3-ae49-2a5b9ad566fa) was the announcement that these four companies plan to spend approximately $320 billion in capital expenditures (capex) through 2025:

|Year|Meta|Alphabet|Microsoft|Amazon|Sum|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2024 ($bn)|39.2|52.6|75.6|77.8|245.2|
|2025 (planned, $bn)|65.0|75.0|80.0|100.0|320.0|

Much less attention was paid to the significant increase in capital expenditures by these companies last quarter:

|Category|Meta|Alphabet|Microsoft|Amazon|Sum|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Last quarter reported ($bn)|14.425|14.276|15.804|27.834|72.339|
|Previous quarter ($bn)|8.258|13.061|14.923|22.620|58.862|
|Change from previous quarter|\+74.7%|\+9.3%|\+5.9%|\+23.1%|\+22.90%|

Since these 4 companies are the largest buyers of NVIDIA's GPUs, it makes sense to examine a correlation between these companies' quarterly capex and NVIDIA's quarterly revenue. For the last 7 quarters, we get a strong correlation coefficient of 0.95 (Pearson correlation). Now, if we use linear regression to estimate NVIDIA's revenue for the yet-to-be-reported Q4 2025 based on this data, we get quarterly revenue of $49.265 billion, which is more than $10 billion above the consensus analyst estimate.

Of course, NVIDIA's GPUs account for only a portion of these 4 companies' reported capex. However, given the recent disappointing results from NVIDIA's competitor AMD, that portion may have increased. It could also be that a lot of datacenters have been built now and these costs were already incurred in previous quarters, leaving more capex for NVIDIA's GPUs - and the newly built datacenters should now have plenty of room for the upcoming Blackwell generation. Of course, companies like Alphabet are also building their own AI chips, but they are much less cost-effective than NVIDIA's Hopper generation and especially the upcoming Blackwell generation. Or as [Amazon CEO Andy Jassy put it on an analyst call last week](https://www.barrons.com/articles/nvidia-stock-price-87ccceac?mod=RTA): ""*most AI compute has been driven by Nvidia chips, and we obviously have a deep partnership with Nvidia and will for as long as we can see into the future.*"" All in all, one could assume that the share of capex from these 4 companies going to NVIDIA may have even increased in the last quarter.

In addition, there are other major buyers of NVIDIA's GPUs: xAI, for example, has also purchased tens of thousands of NVIDIA's GPUs and built the massive supercomputer [Colossus with 100,000 NVIDIA Hopper GPUs](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/spectrum-x-ethernet-networking-xai-colossus). Another massive buyer of NVIDIA's GPUs has just formed with Project Stargate, which plans to invest a staggering [$500 billion in new AI infrastructure](https://openai.com/index/announcing-the-stargate-project/) over the next four years. All of this should continue to be a strong wind in NVIDIA's sails.

My positions: 200 NVIDIA shares.

98,GOOG,"Guys, GOOG and AMD are releasing earnings today.","I'm re-writing to better along with WSB's rules. Alphabet Inc, the parent company of Google, is scheduled to release its fourth-quarter earnings today, February 4, 2025, after the market closes. Analysts anticipate earnings of $2.13 per share on revenue of $96.7 billion, up from $1.64 per share on $86.3 billion the previous year.

I'm really interested in hearing about the company's substantial investments in artificial intelligence and the performance of its cloud services. They have been integrating its latest AI model (Gemini 2.0) across various products and services.

Google Workspace and Sheets, their AI can now analyze data trends and automatically generating static charts, which can be inserted into spreadsheets Gemini AI is also now embedded within Google Cloud services, offering generative AI tools that enhance creativity and productivity. This integration aids in tasks such as code generation, data analysis, and the development of AI-driven applications. Subscribers to the Google One AI Premium Plan gain access to Gemini Advanced features, including enhanced AI capabilities across Google apps, 2 TB of cloud storage, and other premium services. And of course on Android and Pixel devices, Gemini AI powers features like Expressive Captions, which not only transcribe speech but also capture non-speech elements such as sighs and gasps, providing a more comprehensive understanding of audio content. Their AI is also being integrated into Google Search and the Chrome browser, enhancing the user experience with more intuitive and intelligent features. They claim that this should improve search results, personalized recommendations, and advance browsing capabilities. Maybe.

In the cloud sector, Google Cloud is expected to report a 32% rise in revenue for the fourth quarter, following a 35% increase in the previous quarter. This growth rate surpasses that of competitors like Microsoft's Azure and Amazon Web Services. As of right now the stock has already risen 6.9% this year and 41% over the past twelve months, reflecting investor confidence in the company's strategic direction.

As Alphabet prepares to announce its earnings, I wanna know how the company leverages its AI advancements and cloud services to drive future growth. So with that said, is anyone else playing earnings?

Next, I wanted to talk about AMD. They are set to report its fourth-quarter earnings today, From what I've read, analysts anticipate a 22% year-over-year revenue increase to $7.53 billion, with adjusted earnings per share (EPS) expected to rise to $1.09 from $0.77 in the same period last year. Just like Google, I'm focused on checking out AMD's advancements in artificial intelligence. The company has recently unveiled several AI-centric products, including the 5th Gen AMD EPYC processors and the AMD Instinct MI325X accelerators, aiming to enhance performance in data centers and enterprise applications.

But despite these innovations, AMD faces challenges in the AI chip market, primarily due to Nvidia's dominance and the trend of major tech companies developing custom silicon. Looking online, it looks like analysts are predicting that AMD's revenue from AI chips could reach $10 billion this year, driven by growth in the data center segment.

And in the personal computing sector, AMD has expanded its AI capabilities with the introduction of the Ryzen AI 300 Series processors, featuring up to eight ""Zen 5"" CPU cores and the latest RDNA 3.5 graphics architecture.hese processors aim to deliver enhanced AI performance for consumer and commercial applications.

Similarly to the GOOG call, I will be closely monitoring how the company leverages its AI advancements to drive future growth and compete in the evolving semiconductor landscape. But I'm fairly bearish on AMD.",65,59,1738700922.0,2025-02-04T20:28:42+00:00,t3_1ihrkvn

100,GOOG,DD: What is going on with China's recent developments in quantum computing?,"Google [Tianyan-504](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=tianyan-504&amp;t=newext&amp;atb=v452-1&amp;ia=web). Google [Zuchongzhi 3.0](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=tianyan-504&amp;t=newext&amp;atb=v452-1&amp;ia=web). Google it, right now. Who’s reporting this? China is right behind the USA in quantum computing research, and the markets don't seem to have a clue.

TL;DR: Simply put, I believe the markets have not reacted to China’s most recent advancements in quantum computing. China is potentially not as far behind the USA as markets would have you believe. I provide here a commentary of recent market movements, in relation to recent quantum computing news and developments. I follow with a more technical discussion of the significance of China’s advancements, those of US corporations.

Financial disclaimer: While I justify my comments where possible, some of the comments I make in this post are pure speculation. I do not recommend making speculative trades, such as shorting quantum computing, or buying quantum cybersecurity. I am not a financial advisor, and this is not financial advice.

I was astounded to see the latest news dominating the headlines. How did the market not know that China was developing its own language-learning models? I’m a filthy casual, and even I knew about it. It’s been in our news at least [since July](https://www.marktechpost.com/2024/07/20/deepseek-v2-0628-released-an-improved-open-source-version-of-deepseek-v2/), and available for use [since September last year](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/news/news0905). It was pretty fucking good back then, too. And there’s Alibaba’s Qwenchat, Tencent’s HunYuan, among numerous others they haven’t even started talking about yet. What else have they forgotten, in this wild speculative bull run? They probably think the USA is lightyears ahead in quantum computing too. Oh, oh. They do.

Before you go any further, look up [Tianyan-504](https://english.cas.cn/newsroom/cas_media/202412/t20241206_893281.shtml). Look up [Zuchongzhi 3.0](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11924). Google them, right now. They’re right there, massive Chinese developments both announced in December 2024. The Tianyan-504 surpasses 500 qubits, on par with IBM’s latest developments. And Zuchongzhi 3.0 demolishes Google’s earlier Sycamore by all key metrics. Why can’t we find any article produced by any reputable financial sources, that discuss the significance of these achievements? There is essentially zero market news about it. China is right behind the USA in quantum computing research, and the market has no fucking clue.

Check out D-Wave stock prices, for example. Given their business model relies in part on how they contribute to research in the field, they should be negatively impacted by major research developments in competing economies.

This suggests that while Google’s Willow breakthrough rallied quantum computing stocks and Nvidia’s CEO pushed them back down, China’s developments have had zero impact.

How about Quantum Computing Inc (QUBT)? It tells a similar story. Their focus is on fabrication of photonic quantum computing components – and again, providing researchers access to quantum computing technology. It looks like Google’s Willow breakthrough rallied stocks, and Nvidia’s CEO pushed them back down. China’s developments have had zero impact.

https://preview.redd.it/e9dnfa0s57ge1.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f77fb7a50a22340541b4c426433ff210c9a7fbe0

How about IBM? News about Google’s Willow pushed their price down some 3%, which makes good sense. Willow’s performace blew that of IBM’s September R2 Heron processor out of the water. Willow is a competitor, but IBM’s position in the market means they are diversified in so much more than just quantum computing. A small bearish reaction makes perfect sense. So when Tianyan-504 reportedly challenged IBM's benchmarks just three days before Willow did, why didn’t the stock price move?

You can look at SkyWater Technologies (SKYT), and at Global Foundries (GFS), and Rigetti (RGTI), Alphabet (GOOGL), Intel (INTC), TSM (TSM), Keysight Technologies (KEYS), and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Every one of these key companies relevant to advancing quantum computing in the Western World have one thing in common. When China announces their developments, the markets appear to stay still.

There are three possible reasons for this that I have come up with. There may be other reasons as well that I am not aware of, in which case I encourage you to enlighten me.

The first possible reason is as above: The market is generally not aware. It is likely that some players in the market are aware, and this is a simple piece of information that such players will be taking advantage of – they do not have incentive to highlight this knowledge. Furthermore, the market may be uniquely slow to react. Unlike DeepSeek, which we can physically interact with, breaking records in quantum computing research is less tangible, less sensational. Breaking news, markets are irrational.

The second possible reason is simple: China may be lying. I can not find any evidence to support this idea, and China’s past claims about quantum computing, such as those about [Jiuzhang](https://asiatimes.com/2023/10/china-unveils-faster-light-based-quantum-computer/), have been demonstrably true.

The third possible reason is that China’s quantum computers are not as technically advanced as they sound. Originally I wanted to follow with a full technical discussion about the recent history of Chinese Quantum computing, and the merits of Tianyan-504 and Zuchongzhi 3.0 in comparison to western quantum computing efforts. But since I am not a subject matter expert, and I do not have the time to write in full depth. But I will provide a bit more technical information, summarise and provide references to the academic research for relevant breakthrough technologies, so you can read for yourself.

China is fighting to lead the global race in quantum computing, and [the Chinese government has been investing tens of billions of dollars into quantum computing research](https://thequantuminsider.com/2023/04/13/chinese-quantum-companies-and-national-strategy-2023/), alongside the investments of Chinese institutions and corporations.

In 2020 [Jiuzhang, developed at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), was the second quantum computer in the world to achieve quantum supremacy](https://asiatimes.com/2023/10/china-unveils-faster-light-based-quantum-computer/), and the first photonic quantum computer to do so. Since then, the university has gone on to create further models of Jiuzhang, and develop chips with greater qubit lifetime and fidelity.

In April 2024, The Center for Excellence in Quantum Information and Quantum Physics developed their [Xiaohong superconducting chip](https://english.news.cn/20240425/a95b3c190a59486886f4cddc0def31cd/c.html), their most advanced to date, anticipated to reach the chip performance levels of main international cloud-enabled quantum computing platforms such as IBM’s Heron in key performance metrics including qubit lifetime (how long a qubit can hold its quantum state) and readout fidelity (accuracy in extracting information from qubits). I note the market did not appear to react to the Xiaohong chip either.

On the 13^(th) of November 2024,[ IBM announced their Quantum Heron R2](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/qdc-2024), achieving their goal of running quantum circuits with up to 5,000 two-qubit gates, demonstrating advancements in in qubit lifetime and readout fidelity.

On the 6^(th) of December 2024, [Tianyan-504 was announced](https://english.cas.cn/newsroom/cas_media/202412/t20241206_893281.shtml), developed by China Telecom Quantum Group (CTQG) in partnership with the Chinese Academy of Sciences and QuantumCTek Co., Ltd., and, built on the Xiaohong chips. China is now the only country to achieve quantum computational advantage through both photonics and superconducting quantum computing technologies. This quantum computer will be incorporated into their quantum computing cloud platform, and made available for researcher purposes.On the 9^(th) of December, [Google’s Willow was announced](https://blog.google/technology/research/google-willow-quantum-chip/). What makes Willow exceptional, is that it provides a breakthrough solution to quantum computing’s fidelity issue. It exponentially reduces the amount of error while adding more qubits. Presumably Willow can now be scaled further, and I expect to see further developments with adding more qubits now that this challenge has been solved.

Two weeks later, on the 16^(th) of December 2024, an entirely separate research team with the China Telecom Quantum Group (CTQG) in partnership with the Chinese Academy of Sciences and QuantumCTek Co., Ltd. [announced their Zuchongzhi 3.0](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.11924v1#S1). This superconducting quantum computer makes numerous advancements, and demonstrates quantum advantage through speed. It crushes benchmarks set by Google’s older Sycamore - “Compared to Google’s latest experiment, SYC-67 and SYC-70  the classical simulation cost of our 83-qubit, 32-cycle experiment is six orders of magnitude higher.” Though Zuchongzhi 3.0 does not demonstrate the error correction capability that Willow does, their creators have commented that they believe they can replicate the same techniques in a matter of months.

Quantum computing is still twenty years away from being relevant, they say. That gives lots of time for China to catch up. And from what I can understand, China is just one breakthrough away. There are other questions, such as China’s chip manufacturing capabilities, supply chains for components, that I am unable to find good information on. The US is doing what they can politically, through trade regulation, and restricting financial investment in China’s technologies. China already has the [lead in quantum communications, and potentially in quantum sensing](https://itif.org/publications/2024/09/09/how-innovative-is-china-in-quantum/). But China holds one massive advantage: it’s regime. In contrast to the American model, where corporations closely guard their own secrets from eachother, [China is claims they invest 15 billion of dollars into coordinated, cohesive research.](https://itif.org/publications/2024/09/09/how-innovative-is-china-in-quantum/) And it is showing in their results.

Each advancement that China makes in developing its quantum computing capability, ought to remind the market that there is a risk that the lead the US enjoys in quantum computing is being threatened. But look at those google search results again. Outside of technical circles, the western media simply hasn't picked it up. Look at what happened with DeepSeek. I think the markets just don't know. Investors are already anxious about their investments in quantum computing, and are starting to demand returns. Manufacturers are reluctant to scale component production, given the low demand and potential for volatility. So when the market does find out about China’s achievements in quantum computing, what's going to happen?

Let me know what you think.

101,GOOG,Microsoft and OpenAI Probing If DeepSeek-Linked Group Improperly Obtained OpenAI Data,"&gt; Microsoft Corp. and OpenAI are investigating whether data output from OpenAI’s technology was obtained in an unauthorized manner by a group linked to Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek, according to people familiar with the matter.

&gt; Microsoft’s security researchers in the fall observed individuals they believe may be linked to DeepSeek exfiltrating a large amount of data using the OpenAI application programming interface, or API, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Software developers can pay for a license to use the API to integrate OpenAI’s proprietary artificial intelligence models into their own applications.

&gt; Microsoft, an OpenAI technology partner and its largest investor, notified OpenAI of the activity, the people said. Such activity could violate OpenAI’s terms of service or could indicate the group acted to remove OpenAI’s restrictions on how much data they could obtain, the people said.

&gt; DeepSeek earlier this month released a new open-source artificial intelligence model called R1 that can mimic the way humans reason, upending a market dominated by OpenAI and US rivals such as Google and Meta Platforms Inc. The Chinese upstart said R1 rivaled or outperformed leading US developers’ products on a range of industry benchmarks, including for mathematical tasks and general knowledge — and was built for a fraction of the cost. The potential threat to the US firms’ edge in the industry sent technology stocks tied to AI, including Microsoft, Nvidia Corp., Oracle Corp. and Google parent Alphabet Inc., tumbling on Monday, erasing a total of almost $1 trillion in market value.

&gt; David Sacks, President Donald Trump’s artificial intelligence czar, said Tuesday there’s “substantial evidence” that DeepSeek leaned on the output of OpenAI’s models to help develop its own technology. In an interview with Fox News, Sacks described a technique called distillation whereby one AI model uses the outputs of another for training purposes to develop similar capabilities.

&gt; “There’s substantial evidence that what DeepSeek did here is they distilled knowledge out of OpenAI models and I don’t think OpenAI is very happy about this,” Sacks said, without detailing the evidence.

&gt; In a statement responding to Sacks’ comments, OpenAI didn’t directly address his comments about DeepSeek. “We know PRC based companies — and others — are constantly trying to distill the models of leading US AI companies,” an OpenAI spokesperson said in the statement, referring to the People’s Republic of China. “As the leading builder of AI, we engage in countermeasures to protect our IP, including a careful process for which frontier capabilities to include in released models, and believe as we go forward that it is critically important that we are working closely with the US government to best protect the most capable models from efforts by adversaries and competitors to take US technology.”",2356,564,1738120618.0,2025-01-29T03:16:58+00:00,t3_1ickeis

Ali has stated these numbers I believe at 20 million deliveries a day, half of which are walking distance so 10 million a day in the US alone.  20-50 Million $ a day in delivery fees up for grabs in the US alone.  These fees will likely be lower than a driver (at first) prompting people to use the service.

They hope to turn 60-80 million next year from 2000 robots but if they get nowhere near that, the potential is there with other gains they will make advancing the product and getting out the kinks.  Once critical mass is reached and consumers accept these in an area you could imagine them running 24/7 moving things.  We are in the future.


Leader - with Nvidia, a working product that is expanding and weak competitors (e.g competitors drive their robots while serv will operate automously) expect Serv is well positioned to come out as a leader in the US autonomous delivery and restaurant automation.  


Design - care for aesthetics and design with the eyes / wall-e / shopping cart design, needed to make people feel comfortable with the future.


Institutions - started onboarding immediately and expect this to pick up heavily, and into next year with support of Nvidia and partnership with wing.  heavy buying volume from late July.   After cool off has been in constant uptrend from September and edging higher.


Costs - Robot build prices will come down with economies of scale.


Other Benefits - Research and Development in this robotics area poises them for additional spinoffs or pivots into new businesses or government contracts.",26,11,1734668792.0,2024-12-20T04:26:32+00:00,t3_1hibt9k

109,GOOG,Tesla Bull and Bear case: the great AI and liability gamble,"Tesla stock has seen a meteoric rise recently, nearly doubling to $1.4T market cap in just three months. The catalyst is Trump’s victory and Elon Musk’s instrumental role in it. Investors expect Elon’s influence to relax regulations, clearing the way for a robotaxi rollout—a potential game-changer for the automotive industry and transportation infrastructure as a whole.

Tesla is trading like an AI startup, and for good reason: its “Full Self-Driving” (FSD) system is at the heart of the valuation. But investors are making several assumptions that warrant a closer look.  


# The Bull Case: Tesla’s data volume

Tesla has a massive data advantage. With over 4 million vehicles on the road, each equipped with a suite of cameras, Tesla’s fleet constantly collects real-world driving data. This data acts as a “shadow trainer” for its AI, gathering insights in every imaginable driving condition. Meanwhile, FSD subscribers are essentially paying to supervise the AI, providing Tesla with even more labeled data.

Behind the scenes, Tesla employs an army of data labelers to prioritize edge cases—rare and tricky driving scenarios. Tesla combines supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning to continuously refine its AI. More importantly, Tesla’s massive data funnel gives it a clear edge in data volume, which usually means better machine learning.On top of this, Tesla’s vision-only approach—using cameras without lidar—makes its system cheaper and theoretically more scalable. The result? A system that could be deployed anywhere in the world, not just pre-mapped areas.





# The Bear Case: Quantity vs. Quality

More data is not always better, and it’s possible that Tesla might reach a plateau. Teslas are mostly driven in suburban and highway environments, where edge cases are relatively rare, while Waymo trains their AI in dense, chaotic urban areas.  The result is a more diverse dataset that’s constantly evolving.

Waymo is owned by Alphabet (Google’s parent company) and has been operating fully autonomous L4 robotaxis in large cities since 2018. It uses both cameras and lidar.  Combining 2D and 3D data in this way is something Tesla initially set out, but failed, to do.  Elon has said that the lidar data was hard to make sense of, since it often conflicted with the vision data.  But Waymo has somehow managed to make it work.  This means that its data is much richer in quality.  The urban-focused fleet also encounters far more edge cases than Tesla’s suburban-heavy dataset, giving its AI a potentially richer training environment.

The geofencing that Tesla bulls dismiss as a crutch is actually a strategic advantage for Waymo. By limiting its operations to pre-mapped areas, Waymo minimizes liability and achieves Level 4 autonomy with real-world deployments today. Tesla, by comparison, is still at Level 2, which means drivers must supervise and be ready to intervene. Moving from L2 to L4 isn’t just an incremental step—it’s an order-of-magnitude leap in complexity.

Tesla bulls overlook the difference between urban vs. suburban environments. Waymo trains its AI in the most chaotic environments—places like San Francisco and New York City. Tesla’s FSD, by contrast, collects much of its data in relatively predictable suburban and highway conditions. Cities provide more edge cases, such as jaywalking pedestrians, aggressive lane merges, and unexpected construction detours.

As the saying goes, “If you can make it here, you can make it anywhere.” If Waymo’s AI can survive the chaos of Manhattan or downtown LA, it’s far more likely to handle less complex environments like suburbs or rural highways. In contrast, Tesla’s suburban data might create a “same-shit-different-day” scenario, where the AI becomes great at average cases but struggles with rare, high-stakes scenarios.

# Regulatory relaxation is a double-edged sword

If Musk succeeds in relaxing regulations, Tesla might clear the path for robotaxi deployment. In theory, this could limit Tesla’s liability, especially if passengers are required to sign release forms. However, accidents involving unsuspecting third parties (e.g., pedestrians) remain a significant risk. Under current frameworks, manufacturers are liable for autonomous vehicles, meaning Tesla could face infinite exposure, even for a small number of accidents.  Even if Musk changes the regulatory framework, courts ultimately determine liability, and his involvement could be seen as a conflict of interest at best, complicity at worst.

Tesla’s data suggests FSD already outperforms human drivers in safety metrics—which is very impressive. However, publishing accident rates also acknowledges that FSD causes accidents. They currently get away with it because, again, L2 puts the onus on the driver.  But it's a different story if they deploy robotaxis as L3 or L4. In that case, any accident caused by FSD is the onus of Tesla, exposing them to unlimited liability.

# The scalability myth

Tesla bulls often criticize Waymo’s reliance on lidar as costly and unscalable, but this argument doesn’t hold weight for two reasons.  First, lidar is becoming much cheaper, and with volume production, costs could approach Tesla’s camera-only system.  Ironically, Elon’s first principles philosophy should be applied here: just because something was a certain way before doesn’t mean it has to be that way.  Secondly, the market for taxis in general is urban.  When was the last time you saw one in a random suburb or the countryside?  Waymo only needs a few major cities to succeed, giving it a more focused path to profitability.



# Tesla vs. Waymo is really Tesla vs. Google

Waymo uses millions of AI-generated simulations to train its system. It’s AI teaching AI, similar to how AlphaGo and AlphaZero were trained. Tesla may also use simulations, but Waymo’s superior compute power (via Google’s custom TPUs) means it’s clearly dominant in this regard.

Tesla bulls often cite Elon’s dismissal of lidar and geofencing as evidence of Tesla’s superior approach. But they overlook Google’s hegemony in AI.  They were in the game before anyone.  They delivered AlphaGo, AlphaFold, and many other paradigm-shifting, world-changing products, backed by custom hardware and massive compute resources. Tesla’s Dojo may be promising, but it’s still a newbie.  
  


# tl;dr

Tesla’s $1.4T valuation rests on its perceived lead in autonomous driving, which is to say its lead in AI.  If Tesla dominates AI, the stock might still be undervalued. But the data quantity vs. data quality, liability risks, and Waymo’s technical advantages suggest Tesla may be actually falling behind.  In which case, it's vastly overvalued.

111,GOOG,Google Cloud Against the Odds: Beating Microsoft and OpenAI in the AI race to the top!,"https://preview.redd.it/2gel2qczkf6e1.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=176be681bd0ad144f855a86fc9da71e70264906a

In a recent Wall Street survey, Google Cloud topped Microsoft (MSFT.O) and OpenAI as the “most strategic” AI vendor.



Budget changes. As the holiday season approaches, technology procurement leaders at major enterprises are busy prioritizing their technology spending plans for 2025. These budget adjustments could signal potential changes in market share and spending direction.



While OpenAI and Microsoft are getting a lot of attention in the AI space, a new CIO (chief information officer) survey shows that Alphabet (GOOGL.O) is rapidly coming into its own in the enterprise AI spending race.



Piper Sandler's 2025 CIO Survey, which was released over the weekend, interviewed 81 CIOs about their budget priorities for different vendors and technology areas.



“The tech industry will be dynamic in 2025,” Piper Sandler's analyst team writes, ”with generative AI transitioning from the testing/planning phase to implementation and driving growth in cloud spending.”



Analysts noted that 87 percent of CIOs expect their IT budgets to increase in 2025, the highest percentage since the survey began in 2020.



The popularity of Google Cloud increased significantly compared to the previous two surveys. In the “most strategic” AI vendor category, Google Cloud received 27 percent support, up from 15 percent six months ago. Meanwhile, Microsoft, the former leader, saw its support drop from 33% to 24%.



Google Cloud also topped the ranking of AI infrastructure providers. When asked which cloud company they plan to test or implement AI projects with next year, 50 percent of respondents chose Google Cloud.



Overall, this is good news for the major cloud infrastructure providers.The uptick in interest in AI applications and projects has led to higher spending intentions than six months ago for all providers, including Microsoft Azure, Amazon AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).



The trend has been equally favorable to the parent companies of these cloud companies - Microsoft, Amazon (AMZN.O), Alphabet and Oracle (ORCL.N).



It's also a big plus for NVIDIA (NVDA.O), according to Harsh Kumar, a semiconductor analyst at Piper.



All cloud companies are big customers of NVIDIA's AI chips. NVIDIA holds more than 70 percent of the AI GPU (graphics processing unit) market, according to analysts.Kumar expects the AI chip market to exceed $500 billion by 2028.



If CIOs' budget plans come to fruition, 2025 will be a major growth year for AI. Investors are already picking up on the trend, with Alphabet's shares having risen nearly 15 percent this month.

Personally, I think the short-term risk is high and the better strategy in the long run is to buy low

Regards, grab your tendies and gather around the fire because I’m going to tell you all about *$GOOG* (aka Alphabet) the BFTG (Big Fucking ~~Tech~~ Tendie Giant). I’ll break it down for you because I know you polish that 🧠 real nice so I can’t expect a single wrinkle. 

1. Criminally Low P/E Ratio

While all your other tech darlings are flexing P/E ratios like a hooker in heat, $GOOGL is at 23.4 P/E ratio.

For reference:
* $SPX: &gt;27 P/E (yes, the S&amp;P500)
* $MSFT: &gt;36 P/E
* $AAPL: &gt;39 P/E
* $NVDA: &gt;56 P/E
* $AMZN: &gt;47 P/E
* $TSLA: &gt;106 P/E (Fuck you, for the window lickers in the back)

Remember a “good” P/E ratio is traditionally around 20-25. If you don’t understand then read a fucking book.

2. AI Incumming

Sure, everyone’s talking about OpenAI and ChatGPT, but who’s making real money here? Google owns 90%+ of search traffic (when did you ever hear “yahoo it” or “ask duck duck go”?) and monetizes it like a legal cartel. Once Gemini (+Legacy Bard) gets some improvements and a little lipstick even MORE money. Oh, and don’t forget Google Cloud, which grew revenues 30% YoY last quarter.

3. Santa Rally - Ho Ho Hold Onto Your Bollocks 🎅

Historically, December is green season for big-cap tech. Funds rebalance, and retail apes are YOLOing. The Santa Rally isn’t just a meme; it’s a statistical goldmine. With $GOOG’s recent earnings beat ($28.5B in 3 months), the market’s about to price this in as snow starts falling.

4. Big Tech = Safe Haven

Recession? Inflation? Global chaos? Who cares. Big Tech don’t give a *FUCK*. Ad spending may wobble, but companies will NEVER stop buying Google ads.

5. Buybacks on Steroids

$GOOGL has a $70 BILLION buyback program active, the best part? They’re buying low and will push us even higher.

TL;DR: Google Is The Perfect Combo of Value &amp; Growth.

Greetings my friends, and prepare yourselves. Join me as we learn the wey of gey.

What you see before your very eyes is an experimental portfolio I have made. No real money is involved, but essentially this is a watchlist on E\*Trade with share quantities assigned to each stock to fit my hypothetical allocations.

The purpose of this portfolio--gey.

By tilting heavily to the gey factor, we hope to realize the rawdog premium.

The core of this portfolio is Grindr (GRND). It holds a 27% allocation (I had to convince myself to not make it 30% for diversification's sake, although such is still not off the table entirely). The path of gey is risky, but potentially rewarding. Grindr holds what many consider to be somewhat of a monopoly on the LGBTQ+ dating and hookup market. Only the individual who achieves great wealth from Grindr stock can become a true Lord of the Gey.

The other stocks that makeup The Fruitcake Portfolio are stocks that one might consider to be gey-in-some-wey. In reality, this means we must invest in stocks typically designated ""women"" stocks. Now personally, I love stocks of companies whose target audience is women. Just because the product isn't some sci-fi tech robot A.I. missile etc etc, doesn't mean that it isn't a good company with amazing potential. I personally already own ELF and \[redacted\] in my real accounts. However, in this portfolio, beauty, cosmetics, and baby/household care products (diapers, etc) make up around 26% in total (17% for ELF, 9% for \[redacted\]).

Hims &amp; Hers (HIMS) was selected for it's exposure to the men's sexual health market. They got ED pills, condoms, lube, prostate massagers, cock rings, etc. With the addition of a 10% HIMS allocation, The Fruitcake Portfolio will be on all fours, back arched, with its cheeks up in the air for exposure to the chode of this lucrative industry. In addition to HIMS, there is also a small 2% allocation to Church &amp; Dwight (CHD), because they make Trojan condoms.

FBTC is the Fidelity BitCoin ETF. This is the only crypto play in the portfolio and makes up 10% of the portfolio.

If Warren Buffet has Coca Cola (KO), then The Fruitcake Portfolio has Starbucks (SBUX), because Starbucks is zesty, and therefore, perfectly suited, as those who regularly drink from Starbucks follow the wey of gey. Similarly, Cheesecake Factory (CAKE) is more of a growthy-value stability stock in the restaurant sector. I wanted to originally find a vegan or vegetarian stock, however those tend to fail. However, CAKE actually has been expanding its business lately with the restaurant Flower Child. Flower Child serves vegan, vegetarian, paleo dishes, and more. So yes, CAKE is a bit of a compromise pick, but I think it fulfills the requirement of gey.

There is an 11% allocation split between Victoria's Secret (VSCO), Lululemon (LULU), and Nike (NKE). Overall, this is more of a value play and a smaller weight. VSCO is the primary holding here.

Disney (DIS) and Netflix (NFLX) are tiny allocations to streaming services. Need I explain why they are perfect for The Fruitcake Portfolio? If you are a 35 year old male millennial, and you still visit Mickey Mouse every year and take pictures with Cinderella, then you are no novice to the wey of gey.

Finally, we have a tiny 1% allocation to Google (GOOG). Literally the alphabet company.

Something interesting to note is that this portfolio actually tilts very heavily into midcaps. Once ELF becomes a large cap, then things will be more balanced. I’ve considered adding a SCV as well.

\----------------

For stocks and ETFS that didn't make the cut, I had:

TSLA &amp; FSLR: The wey of gey is partial to EVs and clean energy.

VEGN: Basically a cruelty-free S&amp;P 500. Considered including this and removing a bunch of the large cap stocks in the portfolio.

\[redacted\]: An OTC Malaysian stock that I could probably buy through interactive broker. It's particularly NSFW.

\[redacted\]: Weed Stocks.

TGT: Target is Target.

BBWI: Bath and Bodyworks for scented candles and slippery bathtub moments--with bubbles (ofc).

RVLV: Clothing Retailer.

\----------------

If anyone has any ideas of how they might improve this portfolio, feel free to let me know. Any interesting stocks that you think might fit well in the mix? Would you swap out anything?

I plan to track this portfolio's performance. I'm thinking I'll actually buy Grindr shares next week.",57,70,1732681707.0,2024-11-27T04:28:27+00:00,t3_1h0w1eq

126,GOOG,MSFT Pre-Earnings Analysis: AI Arms Race and Channel Check - AI Number May Show Double Digit Growth in Q1 2025 - Monster Quarter Growth,"This might be one of Microsoft's most influential quarters in quite some time. The main argument for my thesis is OpenAI and recent AI model upgrades from in the form of GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-o1, and GPT-o1-mini. As well, I don't know if anyone noticed their Uranium portfolio's going through the roof but if not check out SMR, OKLO and others to see more. AI needs so much power that they are opening up defunct nuclear power plants on 3-mile island in Pennsylvania for new energy sources.

What most media types don't have a window into, mostly I assume this because they keep saying the same silly thing over and over again, is that enterprise is using AI. AI is not going to come in the form of a ""killer app"". The killer app is ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Mistral. Those are the killer apps but those are also not important things in the AI arms race. AI in and of in itself is the killer app. The reason for this is that it commoditized intelligence in the form of tokens that can be literally bought and sold through the cloud.

When certain media types keep railing on the notion that ""who's making money with this"" they are missing the reality in that people are making money with this each and every day. The enterprise is creating applications that are simply not understood by everyday people or analysts because there not the ""killer apps"" that people think of which represents mostly something popular that teenagers and young adults are into. Is Venmo a killer app? Is Facebook a killer apps still? I don't know maybe I'm just not with the times. What i do know is that is that AI is so large and so democratized that the use cases, while not killer, are becoming increasingly ubiquitous in the enterprise setting.

This is the fast and steady drum beat of GAI increasingly taking over all human cognitive tasks.  It won't happen overnight but it is happening. I think what is happening with the media is that they can't put a metric to it so I will attempt to.

AI adoption and penetration into everyday processes and tasks for enterprise is probably at 0.6%-1%. If you include the backlog of potential AI penetration it is probably 2 - 5% of all enterprise tasks and processes. The immediate 1 - 2 year outlook of AI penetration is probably 1 - 3% with a backlog of 6-9%. To be clear, I am not considering productivity gains because who the hell cares about any of that.  I am specifically speaking about cold hard ROI of implementing an AI automation system and having that AI do the work that was once a human task now offloading to an AI automation task.

I don't know how you feel about the above numbers but in my interpretation it is incredibly slow but growth can be incredibly exponential in relatively a short amount of time. The reason, I've written about this many times before, is because the data is not ready, the talent is not there to reconstruct and rebuild what needs to be in place to make efficient data process that are specific to AI, and many many other factors.

This is why consulting through the likes of Accenture, Palantir, IBM and others will be very important in the coming years. It's my opinion that companies now matter how large or small won't be able to put in the right processes without proven practices that will foster from consultancy groups rather than at home grown talent. However, there will be clues of how well the progress is going. An AI channel check if you will.

**AI Channel Check through Microsoft Azure:**

Microsoft provides this channel check for us. Alphabet just completed their channel check and the news on AI was good. Continued spending for all things AI and healthy numbers in their core businesses to justify the continued spend. I look for Microsoft to report much in the same way in terms of AI CapEx/Spend.

2 quarters ago Microsoft started reporting the AI portion of their Azure Cloud revenues. 2 quarters ago it was 6%, and the previous quarter it rose to 7%. For their earnings report tomorrow the AI revenue should be in the 10-12% range. In my opinion 8% is not going to cut it. 1% quarterly gain seems slow. The number in aggregate should be 2%+ quarter to quarter growth. In this way, 1% isn't going to cut it for Wall Street. Perhaps we do see 8%-9% next quarter and that wouldn't be a horrible thing but if Microsoft wants to blow the doors off of earnings and reestablish a healthy growth pattern it is of my opinion that number of percent AI revenue shares needs a meaningful bps up.

I believe that in this earnings there will be that meaningful click upwards of AI percentage growth for Microsoft in the 10%+ range. 11% would be a bust out surprise and 12% would be significantly positive. So where is this possible 3% rise in AI revenue growth coming from? Look no further than GPT-4o.

**GPT-4o and the AI Number**

Gpt-4o was initially released on May 13, 2024. For reference, Microsoft's last quarter was, Q4 2024, ended on June 30, 2024, with earnings reported on July 30, 2024. **AI number 7%**. There was no way for GPT-4o to significantly penetrate into their earnings with only roughly 30 days of usage. If you take into account the iterations of 4o itself the model initially was met with skepticism (compared to GPT-4-Turbo) and apprehension until subsequent versions of 4o were released. All-in-all, there is no way GPT-4o was going to be in the previous quarters (Q4) earnings report.

However, what's even more interesting is the increase in quota and throughput of GPT-4 to GPT-4o. This is where I believe the AI number from Microsoft will materially increase. Let's take a look.

First, let's start with **GPT-4-Turbo** which was released November 6, 2023.

**Git Commit** [e477326](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-ai-docs/blob/e4773268e4e732aefff0f4e3e448568dd4ed998a/articles/ai-services/openai/concepts/models.md):

Commit **e477326** was dated to Nov 22, 2023. A preview was available, 1106, as of Nov 17, 2023. Using this as a ground truth you can see that the token limit is 134k per minute with a max of 2.7 K requests per minute. this and surely prior to this was hell on enterprises to do any meaningful work with the models. It was great for experimenting and getting started but not for meaningful production work.

**GPT-4o** was released on May 13, 2024.

**Git Commit** [431bb24](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-ai-docs/blob/431bb24aadae464afbeb46a522cf613dc9418025/articles/ai-services/openai/quotas-limits.md):

Commit **431bb24** was dated to May 20, 2024. As you can see from previous GPT-4 capacity limitations GPT-4o introduced a massive improvement for quota limit TPM and requests per minute RPM. This is a significant release for enterprise customers as they can now begin to plan, develop, and execute AI software stacks into production environments. 60 K RPM's is a 22X upgrade towards production throughput.

**Git Commit** [30084ae](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-ai-docs/blob/30084aee1f0f82335490af8b4b7bd8912cc02af0/articles/ai-services/openai/quotas-limits.md):

Commit **30084ae** was dated July 24, 2024. In this update the quota TPM was raised from 10M to 30M tokens per minute.

[**Current Quota Limits**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/quotas-limits):

https://preview.redd.it/l2ah831essxd1.png?width=1153&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f59ee5eb421e81d5eb40afb16147f11b3b0c293

In the current quota limits there is a 180 K RPM increase from 60 K. At this point and earlier in the quarter OpenAI's GPT-4o models became capacity unlocked. There is nothing you cannot do or plan for in terms of AI model integrations, TPM's, or RPM throughput. At this moment, intelligence is untethered from any api constraints. What you can imagine building in terms of AI and LLMs and the delivery of those products and services can be fully realized without constraint.

If you go from the beginning analysis of GPT-4-Turbo until today there is a **223X tokens per minute (TPM) increase and a 66.66X request per minute (RPM) increase.**

This is a massive throughput gain that cannot be expressed enough of how significant this is in terms of AI advancements regarding enterprise adoption.

This is why I believe the AI Number finally breaks the double digits in this quarter of 10%+. Ever since the last quarter ended, June 30, 2024, there has been a steady stream of AI model improvements and api throughput improvements that are significant in scope. If you couple this with Google's continued AI spend and quality quarter, AI hardware channel checks that verify the AI hardware spend, and a github repo commit history that shows nothing but blazing improvements for Microsoft Azure intelligence; It could not be more clear to me that Microsoft is executing on all levels and should deliver a potentially monster quarter.

Not that it needs it but here is the plug for NVDA as well. All of those github commits and throughput improvements are directly related to Microsoft bringing data centers online all over the world.

This is insane! I don't have to tell you the git commits for this graph are absolutely bonkers too.

130,GOOG,"Google Q3 Earnings Preview: Advertising, Cloud and Capex","Google is set to announce its Q3 earnings on October 29th, after U.S. markets close. Here are key focal points:

https://preview.redd.it/cr5hbq1wfixd1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ff6f4e0fed7df1b00513c9079e04ecc89b8b18f

**Advertising:**

Google remains the world's undisputed leader in search. Data shows that as of September 30th, Google's web traffic rose 1% from the previous quarter, reaching 2.7 billion visits, while Bing, its closest competitor, saw a 3% drop to just 58 million visits. Google's daily active users (DAU) for Q3 grew about 1% quarter-over-quarter and 6% year-over-year.

However, even Google must remain vigilant. Google's search dominance is being challenged as fast-rising competitors like TikTok and Amazon capture market share. In fact, Google's share of the U.S. search ad market is expected to dip below 50% next year—a first in over a decade.

**Google Cloud:**

In the second quarter, Alphabet's results revenue from Google Cloud surged 28% YoY. Can such high growth be sustained? Let's wait and see.

**YouTube:**

YouTube outpaced Instagram and TikTok in DAU growth over the last quarter. In July, August, and September, YouTube maintained positive DAU growth, while its three main competitors saw declines. Additionally, YouTube extended the maximum length of Shorts from 1 minute to 3 minutes, improving monetization potential.

**Other Growth Areas:**

Alphabet has several potential revenue drivers that have yet to impact its bottom line. Waymo, Alphabet's autonomous driving unit, has partnered with Uber to offer driverless rides in Atlanta and Austin. Additionally, Alphabet's Cloud division, which posted $10 billion in revenue and $1 billion in operating profit in Q2, holds strong growth potential.

**Capital Expenditure:**

In July, CEO Sundar Pichai stated, ""The risk of underinvesting is dramatically greater than the risk of overinvesting for us."" However, Wall Street's patience is limited; investors are looking for returns on AI investments sooner rather than later. Progress in AI commercialization will be a key focus in this earnings report.

**Antitrust Concerns:**

The U.S. Department of Justice has launched an antitrust investigation into Google, hinting at a potential breakup. However, history suggests that forced breakups are rare. Google's relatively low valuation already reflects the policy risks it faces.",46,15,1730127030.0,2024-10-28T14:50:30+00:00,t3_1ge3xvv

135,GOOG,Anyone excited for Nebius (Yandex) resuming trading on Nasdaq this Monday?,"Nebius, the company formerly known as Yandex that’s now focused on cloud infrastructure for AI uses (aka “AI compute”), is to begin trading on the public markets once again — more than two years after the Nasdaq halted trading due to economic sanctions imposed in the wake of Russia’s Ukraine invasion in 2022.

The Netherlands-based company is vying to become one of Europe’s leading players in the burgeoning “GPU-as-a-service” space, and sits in a somewhat unique position — it is a startup in many ways as it’s starting out afresh as a new business, but being a public company means that anyone can invest in it as an alternative to the usual U.S. hyperscalers such as Alphabet or Microsoft.

Founded in 1997, most people know Yandex as the “Google of Russia,” building everything from search engines and advertising products, to maps and autonomous vehicles. Yandex’s core market was very much its domestic Russia plus a handful of neighboring countries, however its parent was a Dutch holding organization called Yandex N.V. which went public on the Nasdaq in 2011, followed by a secondary listing three years later on the Moscow Exchange.

Yandex N.V. was doing well as a public company, reaching a valuation of $31 billion at the end of 2021 before the Russia-Ukraine conflict kickstarted a series of global sanctions against companies in the region, and also individuals. Yandex co-founder and CEO Arkady Volozh was forced to resign after the European Union placed him on a sanctions list, although he was removed from the list in March 2024 which paved the way for his return as CEO of the next version of Yandex N.V.

That next version is Nebius and its business is based on one of Yandex N.V.’s few remaining assets outside of Russia: a Finnish data center and AI cloud business called Nebius AI. The new entity formally emerged back in July, outlining its plans to be a “European AI compute leader,” similar to something like CoreWeave — a company that is also in the midst of expanding into Europe, raising a ton of equity and debt en-route.

While the Nasdaq had said in 2022 that it would delist Yandex and several other Russian-affiliated companies, Yandex appealed and the Nasdaq agreed to maintain its listing — but keep a halt on trading as it went about severing its Russian ties. With those ties terminated earlier this year, and $2 billion in the bank from selling its Russian assets, Volozh said at the time that he intended to continue Nebius as a public company, as it was an easier and cheaper way to access capital, in what is a very capital intensive business.

“Our ambition is to build one of the world’s largest specialist AI infrastructure businesses,” Volozh said in a statement. “This requires access to technological expertise, graphics processing units and capital. These are exactly what we have.”

Nebius said its Class A ordinary shares will resume trading on Monday, October 21, 2024.",19,50,1729266076.0,2024-10-18T15:41:16+00:00,t3_1g6l4nk
136,GOOG,What's happening with Alphabet?,"
With the ongoing antitrust cases, there's talk of Alphabet (Google's parent company) potentially being broken up, and I'm wondering how this could affect the stock. What do you all think?

From what I’ve gathered, here are some scenarios:
- Short-term volatility due to uncertainty during the breakup process.
- Long-term potential gains if the separated units like Android, YouTube, or Cloud are valued more individually.
- Or a drop if investors see inefficiencies in splitting them up.

What’s your take? Could this be a buy opportunity or a risk to avoid?",11,24,1728456713.0,2024-10-09T06:51:53+00:00,t3_1fzlf0y
137,GOOG,US Says It’s Weighing Google Breakup as Remedy in Monopoly Case,"&gt; The US Justice Department told a federal judge it is considering recommending that Google be forced to sell off parts of its operations to alleviate the harm caused by its monopolization of the online search market, in what would be a historic antitrust breakup.

&gt; In a court filing Tuesday, antitrust enforcers said Judge Amit Mehta could also force the Alphabet Inc. unit to provide access to the underlying data it uses to build its search results and artificial intelligence products.

&gt; The Justice Department “is considering behavioral and structural remedies that would prevent Google from using products such as Chrome, Play, and Android to advantage Google search and Google search-related products and features — including emerging search access points and features, such as artificial intelligence — over rivals or new entrants,” the agency said in the filing.

&gt; The filing represents Washington’s first push to dismantle a company for illegal monopolization since unsuccessful efforts to break up Microsoft Corp. two decades ago.

138,GOOG,The Odd Couple - Waymo &amp; Uber Join Forces,"In the world of autonomous vehicles and ride-hailing, a new power couple has emerged: **Waymo** and **Uber.** Once fierce competitors vying for dominance in the autonomous driving space, they have now joined forces in a strategic partnership that has sent ripples through the industry. 

This article will explore this unlikely alliance, analyzing the financial and strategic motivations behind it, the potential benefits and risks for both companies, and the overall impact on the future of transportation

# From Rivals to Partners: A Shift in Strategy

The Waymo-Uber partnership, initially announced in May 2023 and expanded in September 2024, marks a significant shift in strategy for both companies. 

**Uber**, once heavily invested in developing its own autonomous driving technology, has since exited that endeavor and pivoted to a platform-based approach. This partnership allows them to integrate Waymo's proven technology into their ride-hailing app without the substantial R&amp;D costs and risks.

**Waymo**, on the other hand, gains immediate access to Uber's massive user base and operational infrastructure, accelerating the deployment and scaling of its autonomous ride-hailing service.

# A Look at the Financials

Understanding the financial motivations behind this partnership is crucial.

**Uber**, despite showing strong financial performance in 2023 and early 2024 with 15% revenue growth, a shift to profitability, and strong cash flow generation (revenue of $37.3 billion in 2023 and $10.1 billion in Q1 2024, operating profit of $1.1 billion in 2023 and $1.4 billion free cash flow in Q1 2024)^(\[2\]\[4\]), is facing increasing pressure from investors regarding its long-term prospects in the face of autonomous driving disruption^(\[1\]). This partnership allows them to mitigate this risk and position themselves for future growth.

**Waymo**, while not publicly disclosing detailed financials, has received a new $5 billion investment from parent company Alphabet in July 2024, highlighting their continued commitment to the project^(\[3\]). The partnership with Uber offers a faster path to profitability by leveraging Uber's existing infrastructure and customer base, potentially accelerating Waymo's estimated $1.4 billion annual revenue^(\[6\]). Additionally, Waymo's financials are embedded within Alphabet's ""Other Bets"" segment, which reported $285 million revenue and $813 million operating loss in Q2 2023 and $365 million revenue and $1.13 billion operating loss in Q2 2024^(\[7\]).

# A Win-Win Situation?

**For Uber:**

* Access to Waymo's advanced AV technology without the associated R&amp;D costs.
* Potential to increase market share by offering autonomous options to their riders.
* Improved operational efficiency and reduced costs in the long term with autonomous vehicles.
* A strategic move to future-proof their business model and remain a leader in the mobility market.

**For Waymo:**

* Rapid expansion and scaling of its autonomous ride-hailing service through Uber's platform.
* Increased visibility and user adoption of its technology.
* Potential for accelerated revenue growth.

# However, the partnership also presents certain risks:

**For Uber:**

* Dependency risk on Waymo's technology.
* Potential for brand dilution if Waymo's technology encounters issues or negative public perception.
* Risk of cannibalization of its existing ride-hailing business with the introduction of autonomous vehicles.

**For Waymo:**

* Potential conflicts with Uber regarding strategic goals or operational approaches.
* Regulatory scrutiny due to market dominance concerns.
* Limited control over the user experience and branding within the Uber app.

# The Road Ahead

The long-term success of this partnership will hinge on several factors:

1. **Regulatory Landscape**: Navigating the complex and evolving regulations surrounding autonomous vehicles will be crucial.
2. **Public Acceptance**: Overcoming public skepticism and ensuring the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles will be paramount for widespread adoption.
3. **Competitive Landscape**: The rapid development and deployment of autonomous driving technology by other players like Tesla (whose robotaxi announcement caused Uber's stock to fall 9%) will require both companies to continuously innovate and stay ahead of the curve^(\[4\]) . 

The Waymo-Uber partnership, presents a fascinating case study of how former rivals can adapt and collaborate to navigate technological disruption and shape the future of their industry.

139,GOOG,Nvidia reports 122% revenue growth on surging demand for data center chips,"Nvidia reported earnings after the bell that beat Wall Street expectations, and provided stronger-than-expected guidance for the current quarter.

Nvidia shares fell 8% in extended trading.

Here is how the company did versus LSEG consensus expectations:

Earnings per share: 68 cents adjusted vs. 64 cents expected
Revenue: $30.04 billion vs. $28.7 billion expected
Nvidia said it expects about $32.5 billion in current-quarter revenue, versus $31.7 billion expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount. That would be an increase of 80% from a year earlier.

Revenue continues to surge at the chipmaker, rising 122% on an annual basis during the quarter, following three straight periods of year-over-year growth in excess of 200%.

Net income more than doubled to $16.6 billion, or 67 cents per share, in the quarter, from $6.18 billion, or 25 cents per share, in the year-ago period. 

Nvidia has been the primary beneficiary of the ongoing artificial intelligence boom. Nvidia shares are up more than 150% this year after soaring almost 240% in 2023. Its market cap recently eclipsed $3 trillion, and Nvidia was briefly the most valuable public company in the world, though it is now second to Apple.

Revenue in Nvidia’s data center business, which includes its AI processors, climbed 154% from a year earlier to $26.3 billion, accounting for 88% of total sales. It also topped StreetAccount expectations of $25.24 billion.

Not all of those sales are AI chips. Nvidia said Wednesday that $3.7 billion in revenue came from the company’s networking products.

Much of its business is targeted at a handful of cloud service providers and consumer internet companies including Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta and Tesla. Nvidia’s chips, such as the H100 and H200, are used in the vast majority of generative AI applications, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

Many customers are waiting for Nvidia’s next-generation AI chip, called Blackwell. Nvidia said it shipped samples of Blackwell chips during the quarter, and made a change to the product to make it more efficient to manufacture.",42,12,1724887395.0,2024-08-28T23:23:15+00:00,t3_1f3nqxc

**Here are Key Focal Points about Nvidia's Earning:**

With its last quarterly report, Microsoft announced AI spending is poised to continue climbing over the next year. Microsoft is widely believed to be Nvidia's largest customer, and increased spending on AI infrastructure is a clear bullish indicator. Another big customer Meta, also raised its capital-spending guidance range. Tesla had strong demands for Nvidia’s chips.

Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said, The risk of under-investing is dramatically greater than the risk of over-investing for us here. That should be tailwind of Nvidia shareholders.

Nvidia also reported received orders of its A800 GPU worth $5 billion from Chinese tech giants, including Baidu, ByteDance, Tencent, and Alibaba, amid fears of the new export restrictions.

**Nvidia also faces risks:**

There may be more trouble brewing around potential production delays of Nvidia's next generation Blackwell AI chips, means revenue growth might take a hit.

There are also mounting antitrust concerns. US and France regulators are probing.

The company reaching the law of large numbers here, once a company gets to a certain size, it just physically can't keep up the same growth,"" said Michael Schulman, chief investment officer at Running Point Capital.

146,GOOG,"Weekly jobless claims fall to 233,000, less than expected, in a positive sign for labor market","Last night, the U.S. announced that the number of initial unemployment claims for last week was 233,000, significantly lower than the previous week's 249,000 and also below the market's expectation of 240,000! A few days ago, Mr. Wang mentioned that for the U.S. stock market to stop declining, the economic and labor data released must continue to be strong in order to ease concerns about a potential economic recession.

Yesterday's sharp drop in initial unemployment claims marked the largest decrease in a year, indicating that the number of people recently unemployed has decreased. This alleviated the recession concerns raised by last Friday's non-farm payrolls and unemployment rate data, spurring a rally in U.S. stocks, with the S&amp;P 500 index surging over 2.3%, the largest single-day gain in 21 months 📈.

On the other hand, the demand for the 10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds at the auctions over the past two days was poor, causing the 10-year yield to exceed 4% once again! Tech giants saw a broad rebound, with Meta rising 4.2%, Alphabet up 1.9%, Amazon gaining 1.8%, Apple increasing 1.6%, and Microsoft rebounding 1%.

Nvidia surged over 6%, returning to the $100 mark, leading to a rebound in semiconductor stocks. Broadcom, Micron, and Applied Materials all jumped more than 6%, while Qualcomm, Texas Instruments, and AMD all saw gains of over 5%! Taiwan's ADRs (American Depositary Receipts) also rebounded, with TSMC and UMC both jumping more than 6%, and ASE gaining over 4%.

However, it's still important to note that the number of continuing unemployment claims is rising, reaching its highest level since November 2021, nearly three years ago! Therefore, Wall Street's foreign investors remain concerned about the economy. For example, JPMorgan still believes the U.S. economy will enter a recession, raising the probability from 25% to 35%! This echoes Goldman Sachs' recent increase in the U.S. recession probability, from 15% to 25%⬆️.

&gt; Google’s payments to make its search engine the default on smartphone web browsers violates US antitrust law, a federal judge ruled Monday, handing a key victory to the Justice Department.

&gt; Judge Amit Mehta in Washington said that the Alphabet Inc. unit’s $26 billion in payments effectively blocked any other competitor from succeeding in the market. 

&gt; Antitrust enforcers alleged that Google has illegally maintained a monopoly over online search and related advertising. The government said that Google has paid Apple Inc., Samsung Electronics Co. and others billions over decades for prime placement on smartphones and web browsers. This default position has allowed Google to build up the most-used search engine in the world, and fueled more than $300 billion in annual revenue largely generated by search ads.

148,GOOG,Apple Intelligence Has a Long Way to Go to Match Its Marketing Hype,"Selected Excerpts:

&gt; “After testing the first beta version of Apple Intelligence myself, I can tell you that the features don’t yet live up to the excitement. In their current state, they’re a far cry from the game-changing technology that fans and investors hope Apple Intelligence will become.”

&gt; “You even see some analysts describing it as **a breakthrough akin to the original iPhone.”**

&gt; “Let me be clear: At this point, Apple Intelligence isn’t that.”

&gt; Now, it’s true that this is just the first beta release and the company will undoubtedly improve it over the next few months. But I suspect that we’re seeing a fairly good picture of what Apple Intelligence will look like when it debuts around October. 

&gt; “I found the ability to summarize emails to be useful: It provided an excellent distillation of the message’s content. This is particularly a perk for message previews, which typically just show the first few lines of an email. But the summaries of text message conversations — particularly for fast-moving group chats — were a disappointment and mostly useless. Summaries are also helpful in Safari for articles, but I don’t foresee that being a particularly popular feature. “

&gt; “The most impressive features so far are Writing Tools, Type to Siri and phone-call recording summaries. The Writing Tools are essentially a well-integrated version of Grammarly-style features. It works nicely, but this is the kind of thing that’s been available on Android phones for a while now.”

It works nicely, but this is the kind of thing that’s been available on Android phones for a while now.”

&gt; “I was less impressed with the reply suggestions in Messages, which don’t immediately seem like a major upgrade over the existing keyboard suggestions in iOS. They could be a lot more thoughtful, perhaps by better using the context of the chat so far, rather than just the last message in the thread.”

&gt; “The best feature is the ability to record a phone call and get a transcript of the conversation as well as a summary of what took place. In my tests, this has worked almost flawlessly, and the summaries have been excellent. It’s certainly a nice time saver.”

&gt; “Type to Siri is also a nice upgrade, as is the new visual cue that Siri is active on the iPhone, iPad and CarPlay. But neither of those interface improvements has anything to do with AI.”

&gt; “In any case, these are mainly niceties, not necessities.”

&gt; “There is nothing so compelling yet that would make an iPhone 14 Pro user upgrade to an iPhone 16 just for Apple Intelligence.”

&gt; “Some key Apple Intelligence features aren’t in the initial beta. [Such as AI PHOTO APP and OS-INTEGRATED CHATGPT.] These latter capabilities will likely come in November or December. 

&gt; “Users will have to wait until 2025 to see the fully revamped Siri.”

&gt; “But even when [these delayed features of] Apple Intelligence [are] available, the company will still be playing catch-up. Alphabet Inc.’s Google is miles ahead of Apple in applying AI to photos.”

This is because ever since 2020 the S&amp;P 500 has become evermore increasingly expensive compared to the net revenue per share. it currently has a PE ratio=30 and we are seeing that small cap stocks are more valuable and bang for buck then industry leaders. (this has been commonly brought up on CNBC and Bloomberg)

More than half the return of the S&amp;P 500 came from Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet with these stocks being down in some bit during 2024 has dragged S&amp;P 500 down at least 1%.

So then since the Russel 2000 is 1/15 the size of the S&amp;P500 with even a little bit of money circulating into the index there could be a big change in price. Also with the June consumer price index being in favor of small cap companies as we saw on day of release a 3.6% gain then also this is in favor for small cap companies as with inflation going towards healthy range and there being 2 fed rate cuts in 2024 could alleviate the high debts that these small cap companies take on, With these debt levels being relieved then we can see a surge in revenue from these companies thus driving the Russel 2000.

**Bull Case:**

SMMT is developing a drug called Ivonescimab, it's a bispecific antibody that combines PD-1 and VEGF inhibition. They're in collaboration with Akeso which helps enhance research capabilities and market reach as they have one of the richest and most diversified antibody drug pipelines in China.

Currently seeing positive data from Akeso’s trials in China showing potential to outperform Keytruda, a drug developed by Merck that has been pretty damn successful and profitable.

They have exposure to large oncology market potential, with Ivonescimab targeting high-need areas like EGFR mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and squamous NSCLC.

Strong cash position and clear roadmap to profitability. They just secured a significant financial boost by entering into a $200 million private placement deal with a sale of over 22 million shares at $9/share (why the price jumped in May)

Summit’s license territories for Ivonescimab will include Latin America, including Mexico and all countries in Central America and South America, in addition to the Middle East and Africa. This expansion adds to the territory licensed by Summit, which previously included the United States, Canada, Japan, and Europe.

**If more data comes out from other trial regions backing up the claims coming from China it's going to garnish quite an interest from institutions. At that point a buyout could be very likely and $40-$50 wouldn't be unheard of if this drug proves it's providing more meaningful improvement over Keytruda.**

**Bear Case:**

Data from China trials could be untrustworthy as data from trials in China are known to be. Would need to wait and see data coming from other regions to confirm the positive results seen thus far in China. Trials are currently being conducted in China, Canada, US, and Europe.

Plays like this rarely work out when in a highly competitive landscape mired with clinical and regulatory risks.

Could still take quite a while to play out. Phase III has been ongoing since 2023 and will probably continue for another 2-3 years. In that time an asteroid could crash to Earth bearing a species of highly sentient muppets that have telekinetic abilities and will enslave us all to a life of servitude entertaining them with singing the alphabet and spelling fruits.

However, there is a potential that highly bullish interim data could present itself and light this thing off.

154,GOOG,Nvidia Just Getting Started: Stock Heading to $150 and Possibly $200 by year’s end,"A lot of people think Nvidia is overvalued or a bubble, but I think Nvidia will easily get to $150 by the end of July or beginning of August and $200 by the end of the year. 

AI, and Nvidia along with it, are generational investment opportunities. Nvidia has a first mover advantage in which they’ve continuously blown expectations out of the water in earnings reports but they don’t settle for just that. They constantly innovate with new chips such as Blackwell coming out that will be even more efficient and economical.

Yes, Nvidia’s stock valuation of $3T is high but at one point $1T was unthinkable. Then Apple crossed that line and they didn’t just stop with iPhones - they expanded into services. Nvidia can do the same such as in: self driving cars, human robots, weather forecasting, safety whether in manufacturing, complex companies or industries, medical diagnosis or cures for diseases will be a huge boom for the stock going forward. The possibilities for AI are exponential. Whether we like it or not, trillion dollar companies seem to be becoming the norm - of which Broadcom could be the next of what has been an exclusive club until now.

Every time there have been investors saying Nvidia couldn’t possibly go up anymore or beat earnings again, Nvidia shatters expectations and the stock goes up. How many times have there been articles saying AMD would take Nvidia’s place or had a Nvidia killing chip - yet after years that hasn’t happened and Nvidia’s only gotten stronger.

That’s not to say over time Nvidia won’t lose some market share or have a down year or miss an earnings report, it’s not always going to be 100% rosy or smooth sailing - after all it is a chip stock fundamentally. There are risks such an economic downturn, human caused climate change, regulations, demand on the power grid that all threaten AI. At the same time, I just believe that at the end of the day AI will play a large role in the future and with that Nvidia is at the center. Chips are in so many things and the potential for AI to change the world really could just be the start of the next Industrial Revolution.

Plus given how bloated the valuations of every stock are right now - and how much Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple are increasing their valuations - Nvidia is far from alone with high valuations. I don’t think AI is a bubble but I do think that Nvidia and the market as a whole can get ahead of themselves.

Overall, this is likely just the initial first stage - not the end - of Nvidia’s growth story.",1051,511,1719798810.0,2024-07-01T01:53:30+00:00,t3_1dshht2

However, Alphabet has been going down a bad path, and the management is hollowing out the value of this tech giant for short term profit. I understand Alphabet needed to reorganize and slim down. Yet, there are strategic reductions, and then there is peacocking to investors for short term gain.

I think a lot of Google’s problems have stemmed from Sundar mismanagement of the company. The company has only iterated on existing products, and [it has failed to innovate at all](https://notes.willrobbins.org/p/google-has-50b-doesnt-innovate). It is inevitable to some degree, but it shouldn’t have happened so quickly. Alphabet had years of a head start and the best talent in the market.

In sum, I think the recent reductions and policies are really trading short term gains for the long term viability of the company. These are opinions to an extent, but it is hard to defend the management given any recent headline.",18,41,1715846018.0,2024-05-16T07:53:38+00:00,t3_1ct7o59
165,GOOG,Morgan Stanley hikes Price Target on Arm Artificial Intelligence CPU boost,"Is anyone seeing this or is it just me. Are we talking about TSMC here or...

Morgan Stanley analysts hiked their price target on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TW:2330) (NYSE:TSM) (TSMC), citing improved prospects for the world’s biggest contract chipmaker from artificial intelligence-geared processors based on **Arm technology**. 

TSMC’s price target was raised to T$928.0 from T$860.0, while Morgan Stanley analysts also maintained their overweight rating on the stock. The updated PT represents an upside of 16% from TSMC’s last close of T$800.

Morgan Stanley analysts said that increased demand for processors based on British chipmaker **Arm Holdings**' (NASDAQ:[**ARM**](https://www.investing.com/equities/arm)) technology was expected to be an important growth driver for TSMC, given that the chipmaker makes almost 100% of all **Arm-based processors**. 

**Demand for Arm-based processors is expected to pick up amid increasing adoption of AI**, while TSMC’s CoWoS chip packaging technology is also expected to factor into advancements in AI chip development.

Morgan Stanley expects TSMC’s foundry share in global CPU markets will be close to **60% in 2028**, up from 37% in 2023, and will also become a bigger revenue driver for the firm.

Increased development of in-house, AI-geared silicon by major tech firms- such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)- also factors into improved prospects for TSMC, given that foundry work for the chips will be outsourced to the Taiwanese firm. 

AI darling NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)- which is among TSMC's biggest customers- also develops its most advanced **AI chips on Arm**.

Increased demand for AI chips fueled stronger earnings from TSMC in the first quarter. But the chipmaker had also warned that AI demand may not be sufficient in offsetting a broader decline in chip demand, especially amid weaker global PC and smartphone sales. ",6,6,1715138488.0,2024-05-08T03:21:28+00:00,t3_1cmuqp4
166,GOOG,Why I'm getting AMZN calls for today's earnings,"Amazon (AMZN) is scheduled to report its fiscal Q1 2024 results **today.** I expect amazon to do well today on both earnings and revenues, and I'll explain why here. The company outperformed the street expectations in the last quarter, with net revenues increasing by 14% to $170 billion. It was driven by a 13% rise in the North America and Amazon web services segments, followed by a 17% gain in the International division. We expect the first quarter result to follow the same trend. I also am anticipating Amazon will release a dividend like META and GOOG, which I'll go into a lot of detail later. 

Let's talk about AMZN's ride over the past few years—it's been a bit of a roller coaster, especially when you stack it up against the S&amp;P 500. Back in early 2021, AMZN was hovering around $165. Fast forward to now, and it's ticked up to about $180. Sounds decent, right? But hold up, because that's nothing compared to the S&amp;P, which has shot up by roughly 35% in the same period.

Looking at the yearly breakdown: AMZN only inched up by 2% in 2021, then took a massive 50% dive in 2022, but bounced back hard with an 81% surge in 2023. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 had its own drama but less extreme, posting a 27% gain in 2021, dropping 19% in 2022, and climbing back up by 24% in 2023.

The takeaway? While AMZN did outperform the S&amp;P in 2023, it lagged behind in the previous years. And this isn't just an AMZN thing—other big names in the Consumer Discretionary sector like TSLA, TM, and HD, and even tech giants like GOOG, MSFT, and AAPL have also found it tough to consistently beat the S&amp;P, in both up and down markets. So, what's next for AMZN? Let's keep our eyes peeled for their upcoming earnings report.

# Revenue Beat

Amazon’s revenues grew 12% y-o-y to $574.8 billion in FY2023. All major categories posted growth in the year – online stores (5%), physical stores (6%), third-party seller services (19%), subscription services (14%), advertising services (24%), and AWS (13%). We expect the same trend to continue in Q1. Overall, we forecast Amazon’s revenues to touch $641.4 billion for the full-year 2024.

# EPS Beat 

Amazon Q1 2024 adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $0.85 per Trefis analysis, 2% above the consensus estimate of $0.83. The adjusted net income increased from -$2.7 billion to $30.4 billion in FY 2023. It was primarily because of lower operating expenses as a % of revenues, higher revenues, and a significant jump in the total non-operating income from -$18.2 billion to $705 million. Notably, the non-operating income was down in 2022 due to a marketable equity securities valuation loss. Further, the same trend was witnessed in Q4 2023. We expect the Q1 results to be on similar lines. Overall, Amazon is likely to report an annual GAAP EPS of $4.12 and revenue per share of $61.48 for the full-year 2024.

# Possible Dividend Announcement

Meta threw out its first dividend this March, and Google's parent company Alphabet isn't far behind, announcing a 20 cent dividend set for mid-June. This leaves us wondering about Amazon—when are they joining the dividend party?

By the numbers, it seems like it’s about time Amazon starts giving back some quarterly cash to its shareholders. Over the last decade, Amazon has racked up a cool $90 billion in free cash flow. Out of that giant pot, it only used about $6 billion for share buybacks in 2022, which is roughly a 7% capital return.

In comparison, other trillion-dollar behemoths have been way more generous, returning about 75% of their free cash flow over the past year—though most of that was through share repurchases rather than dividends. Together, these non-Amazon trillion-dollar companies generated around $323 billion in cash flow over the last year, paid out $38 billion in dividends, and snapped up about $240 billion in their own stock.

For Amazon, cash flow isn't the issue. Wall Street's looking at a projected free cash flow of about $62 billion for 2024, which is expected to jump to $82 billion by 2025, per Bloomberg. So, the big question remains: when will Amazon start sending some of that cash flow back to shareholders in the form of dividends? Let's stay tuned and see if they'll open up their wallet.

But what would this look like? If Amazon decided to payout 75% of its projected 2024 free cash flow, we're talking about a dividend yield of around 2.4%. That actually beats the average 2.2% yield from other dividend-paying companies in the S&amp;P.

This 2.4% isn't just dividends—it includes any buybacks Amazon might throw into the mix. To give you a benchmark, the total shareholder yield for S&amp;P 500 dividend payers has been about 3.3% over the past year. With Amazon’s hefty cash flow, it’s looking more and more like they’re due to start sharing the wealth.

Just for context, consider a bit of history. Microsoft went public back in 1986, and it took them 17 years and a revenue climb from less than $200 million to $32 billion before they started paying dividends in 2003. Since then, Microsoft’s sales have been growing at a steady 10% yearly, with around $28 in dividends per share dished out to date. Fast forward to 2024, Microsoft’s expected to hit sales around $260 billion.

Amazon, on the other hand, went public in 1997 and has exploded from $600 million to nearly $600 billion in annual sales. With projections showing a growth rate of about 12% over the next few years, Amazon is well-positioned to both fuel further growth and start paying dividends.

Currently, Microsoft’s stock yields about 0.8%. If Amazon wanted to match this, they’d need to allocate roughly 20% of their forecasted free cash flow for the next two years to dividends—totally doable since S&amp;P 500 dividend payers typically spend about half their free cash flow on dividends.

Bottom line: Amazon doesn’t need to aim for a 0.8% yield right off the bat. Kicking things off with literally any dividend would be a solid move. And if they do so, the stock will PUMP. This is why I'm getting calls for earnings. A call spread would be good, for those who can't get a call spread, AMZN 5/3 190c @ 3.20 doesn't look too bad. I'm picking 190c because the stock has *on average* moved about 7% up or down with earnings. A 7% push up today would bring the stock to about 192ish. Not enough for the calls to profit, so getting a call spread is deal. To do this, I'll just sell the 200c @ 1.19. So the cost of the whole position becomes 2.01/share. Not too bad. Good luck guys.",261,198,1714493011.0,2024-04-30T16:03:31+00:00,t3_1cgwhxy

174,GOOG,Meta Platforms announced its latest custom-made chips designed to support AI generative artificial intelligence products and services,"Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) announced its latest custom-made chips designed to support generative artificial intelligence products and services on Wednesday.

&amp;#x200B;

The announcement came just one day after Intel (INTC) unveiled its Gaudi 3 accelerator for enterprise gen AI. Coincidentally, on the same day, Alphabet's Google (GOOG)(GOOGL) showcased its latest in-house chips, Axion, to help the tech giant address rising computing costs, handle more AI-related workloads and cut its reliance on outside vendors such as Nvidia (NVDA).

&amp;#x200B;

Social media titan Meta's latest generation of the Meta Training and Inference Accelerator, MTIA, designed for AI-workloads, are intended to power its ranking and recommendation ads models.

&amp;#x200B;

""As AI workloads become increasingly important to our products and services, this efficiency will improve our ability to provide the best experiences for our users around the world,"" the company said.

&amp;#x200B;

The latest MTIA more than doubles the compute and memory bandwidth of its predecessor, which was released last year.

&amp;#x200B;

""To support the next-generation silicon, we have developed a large, rack-based system that holds up to 72 accelerators,"" Meta said. ""We specifically designed the system so that we could clock the chip at 1.35GHz (up from 800 MHz) and run it at 90 watts compared to 25 watts for our first-generation design.""

&amp;#x200B;

Meta also updated the software stack, PyTorch, associated with the upgraded MTIA chips. The company also created Triton, an open source language and compiler for writing highly efficient ML compute kernels, to maximize hardware utilization.

&amp;#x200B;

""We currently have several programs underway aimed at expanding the scope of MTIA, including support for GenAI workloads,"" Meta added.

Any other regards betting on GOOG being on a breakout from cup and handle, or just me? I can add more crayon to the image if needed. 

&amp;#x200B;

177,GOOG,Implications of Google Buying HubSpot,"**What Happened:** The second the internet found out that Alphabet, the parent company of Google, was in talks to make a bid for the marketing software company Hubspot…

Well… let's just say investors ran to purchase some shares. 

**Background:** HubSpot, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, had a market cap of around $32 billion before the news was leaked by [Reuters](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/technology/hubspot-stock-jumps-amid-reports-google-parent-alphabet-considering-acquisition/ar-BB1l5hUX). The company provides businesses with marketing and customer service software.

**Company Synergies:** Many corporations track their SEO and Google Analytics data through HubSpot to see how well their site and the blogs or articles within it are performing over time, so the synergies are definitely present between the two companies. 

**Potential Implications:** Alphabet must be careful as it has faced some major antitrust scrutiny over the past year.

* The U.S. Department of Justice recently filed its second antitrust suit against Google’s ad business.
* The first antitrust lawsuit, filed in October 2020, accused Google of unlawfully obtaining a monopoly in the search market.

To make sure no antitrust issues come about this time around, Alphabet is making sure to consult with its financial partner, Morgan Stanley, first before making a potential offer. 

Under the Biden administration, technology conglomerates have found it difficult to pursue mega deals that could cause unfair monopolistic competitive advantages in the industry.

**Bottom line:** If the acquisition were to go through, it would be the largest in Alphabets history and allow for its mega pile of cash to be put to use, currently at $110.9 billion as of the end of December[om here](https://www.blackswanstreet.com/subscribe)",10,5,1712344901.0,2024-04-05T19:21:41+00:00,t3_1bwqki2

180,GOOG,Alphabet BERS hate this one simple trick,"Hi my fellow bol chads

I'm a avid user of YouTube mobile and noticed in c. the last month that YouTube have changed their mobile ad format. Previously it was 'wait 5 seconds, then can skip both ads', now it's 'wait 5 seconds, skip the first ad, wait another 5 seconds, skip the second ad'.

This just blew my mind (not literally thankfully).

Just think about it my friends. This small change has effectively increased YouTube's mobile ad revenue by 100%. 100% (in theory). Incredible. Mobile ad revenue is a big chunk of Alphabet's revenue, so IMO revenue might beat expectations.

Also they might announce more details about integrating AI into apple products, so another bullish reason for next earnings.

Obviously have to throw some meat to those hungry bears, so another thought is that this increase in mobile ad revenue is offset by a potential increase in ad blockers from YouTube's more aggressive ad policy. IDK, just speculation as it can't be measured externally.

Let me know your thoughts

See: [ChatGPT Passes Google Coding Interview for Level 3 Engineer With $183K Salary](https://www.pcmag.com/news/chatgpt-passes-google-coding-interview-for-level-3-engineer-with-183k-salary)

That's right.  Your favorite fucking slur word against bears when they make complete sense about overvaluation and bubbles and what-not.  I spek-ulate these positions will be replaced by AI, and the $183,000 engineering salary for these high cost of living areas will be put back in the pocket of the company.  Multiply that by 701 employees getting the boot, and that is $128,283,000 saved and put onto the market cap of the company, which isn't a lot, but we are just getting started with integration.  I know that is outrageously optimistic and there are sure to be HR staff, Graphic Artists, DEI Leaders, Janitors, and whatever other clowns that google has hired among some of the top salaries in the country.

Instead of losing manpower however, it is being replaced by a more agile technology that has a much lower operating cost.  This is what makes it different than your average layoff of a bloated employee pool.

Also,  What they did not disclose to the government is they have began laying off contractors in oregon for the Youtube Music Side of things.  The massive amount of subtitle work for every youtube song and podcast can now be automated.

I'm marking it as a discussion not DD since I feel it's a fairly simple strategy.

Also, if you work for google in these counties, sorry you had to hear it from me instead of a Sunday morning text saying don't come to work anymore.

185,GOOG,"NVIDIA will cross 2,000$","NVIDIA is going to cross 2,000$

Listen up regards, today lord Sam 7 trillion Altman of OpenAI released an AI model to send YouTube creators out of business. (Link : https://openai.com/sora) Ok, YouTubers will soon run out of Tendies, how does this mean NVIDIA will reach 2000$ you ask?


Well to see the connection you need to understand a bit of AI. There are 2 big models that currently exist: Transformers and Diffusion. The thing about transformers is that they operate on tokens. For language a bunch of letters together form a token. “ab” can be 1 token, “can” another token and so on. Basically they do not think in terms of single alphabets but actually think in terms of tokens. So OpenAI took 100 million Microsoft bucks, 1 billion+ NVIDIA GPU’s and created ChatGPT that started this AI bull run. 

Then came the question how to apply this technique to images. Naively each image generates far more tokens than a thousand word essay and so understanding an image seems extremely inefficient. Transformers will not work, smooth brained critics said. Then Sam Altman pulled the infinite money Microsoft glitch and OpenAI trained a massively large transformer on an ungodly number of GPUs and showed we could perfectly understand images with GPT-4. 

“Well ok maybe images work, but this will never work for videos, that would require an insane amount of compute”, smooth brained critics said. It turns out these critics just lacked imagination since Sam Altman proceeded to ask for 7 trillion dollars, more than the GDP of every country except US and China to throw more compute at AI. So when OpenAI says they will just brute force AI, throw trillions of compute at it and achieve AGI you better believe them. They have now come out with a transformer based Video Diffusion model. They never mentioned how big this model is, but it is probably bigger than GPT-4 . GPT-5 which is rumored to be able to understand and answer questions on video, is probably one order of magnitude bigger than GPT-4 and might cost 1 billion + to train. This means the market is still significantly underestimating the demand for NVIDIA chips and NVIDIAs price target should be 2000$ + in coming future.

TLDR; OpenAI’s foray into video using transformers shows there is far more compute they can use to generate even better AI’s. They will probably buy 10X the compute they already bought, from NVIDIA in the coming years in their quest to build AI. NVIDIA will skyrocket as a result.",6,75,1708035138.0,2024-02-15T22:12:18+00:00,t3_1arrumb

187,GOOG,Nvidia chases $30 billion custom chip market with new unit,"Nvidia NVDA  is building a new business unit focused on designing bespoke chips for  cloud computing firms and others, including advanced artificial  intelligence processors, according to nine sources familiar with the  company's plans.

The dominant global designer and  supplier of AI chips aims to capture a portion of an exploding market  for custom AI chips and to protect itself from the growing number of  companies interested in finding alternatives to its products.

The  Santa Clara, California-based company currently controls about 80% of  the market for high-end AI chips, a position that has sent its market  value up 40% so far this year to $1.73 trillion after it more than  tripled in 2023.

Its customers, which include ChatGPT creator OpenAI, Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOG and Meta Platforms META, have raced to snap up the dwindling supply of Nvidia chips to compete in the rapidly emerging generative AI sector.

Nvidia's  H100 and A100 chips serve as a generalized, all-purpose AI processor  for many of those major customers. But the tech companies have started  to develop their own internal chips for specific needs. Doing so helps  reduce energy consumption, and potentially can shrink the cost and time  to design.

Nvidia is now attempting to play a role in  helping these companies develop custom AI chips that have flowed to  rival firms such as Broadcom AVGO and Marvell Technology MRVL, according to the sources who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly.

""If  you're really trying to optimize on things like power, or optimize on  cost for your application, you can't afford to go drop an H100 or A100  in there,"" Greg Reichow, general partner at venture capital firm Eclipse  Ventures said in an interview. ""You want to have the exact right  mixture of compute and just the kind of compute that you need.""

Nvidia does not disclose H100 prices, which are higher than for the  prior-generation A100, but each chip can sell from $16,000 to $100,000  depending on the volume purchased and other factors. Meta has said it  plans to bring its total stock to 350,000 H100s this year.

Nvidia officials have met with representatives from Amazon .com AMZN,  Meta, Microsoft, Google and OpenAI to discuss making custom chips for  them, according to two sources familiar with the meetings. Beyond data  center chips, the company has pursued telecom, automotive and video game  customers.

In 2022, Nvidia said it would let  third-party customers integrate some of its proprietary networking  technology with their own chips. The company has said nothing about the  program since, and Reuters is reporting its wider ambitions for the  first time.

A Nvidia spokesperson declined to comment beyond the company's 2022 announcement.

Dina McKinney, a former Advanced Micro Devices AMD  and Marvell executive, heads Nvidia's custom unit and her team's goal  is to make its technology available for customers in cloud, 5G wireless,  video games and automotives, according to a LinkedIn profile. Those  mentions were scrubbed and her title was changed after Reuters sought  comment from Nvidia.

Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Meta and OpenAI declined to comment.

$30 BILLION MARKET

According  to estimates from research firm 650 Group’s Alan Weckel, the data  center custom chip market will grow to as much as $10 billion this year,  and double that in 2025.

The broader custom chip market  was worth roughly $30 billion in 2023, which amounts to roughly 5% of  annual global chip sales, according to Needham analyst Charles Shi.

Currently, custom silicon design for data centers is dominated by Broadcom and Marvell.

In  a typical arrangement, a design partner such as Nvidia would offer  intellectual property and technology, but leave the chip fabrication,  packaging and additional steps to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.  2330 or another contract chip manufacturer.

Nvidia moving into this territory has the potential to eat into Broadcom and Marvell sales.

""With  Broadcom's custom silicon business touching $10 billion, and Marvell’s  around $2 billion, this is a real threat,"" said Dylan Patel, founder of  the silicon research group SemiAnalysis. ""It's a real big negative -  there's more competition entering the fray.""

BEYOND AI

Nvidia is in talks with telecom infrastructure builder Ericsson 61QS  for a wireless chip that includes the chip designer's graphics  processing unit (GPU) technology, according to two sources familiar with  the talks.

650 Group's Weckle expects the telecom custom chip market to remain flat at roughly $4 billion to $5 billion a year.

Ericsson declined to comment.

Nvidia also plans to target the automotive and video game markets, according to sources and public social media postings.

Weckel  expects the custom auto market to grow consistently from its current $6  billion to $8 billion range at 20% a year, and the $7 billion to $8  billion video game custom chip market could increase with the  next-generation consoles from Xbox and Sony 6857.

Nintendo’s  current Switch handheld console already includes an Nvidia chip, the  Tegra X1. A new version of the Switch console expected this year is  likely to include a Nvidia custom design, according to one source.

Nintendo declined to comment.

194,GOOG,"""Judgment Day april 8th"" - a fun, atypical bet on a lawsuit - Paltalk vs. Cisco","Sorry if this doesn't belong here (haven't taken out a mortgage on the house or pissed away my wife's savings for this, and the bot seems to detest penny-stock tickers), but I figured it might be a fun David vs. Goliath-situation kinda deal.

The meat of it: Paltalk is suing Cisco over patent infringement. Apparently they made some enhancements to Webex VOIP stuff (think shitty teamspeak/ventrilo-call-days) that made it possible to have a lot more people in on a call without cutting each other off as I understand it, and patented it. Cisco then used this modified tech over a number years without paying Paltalk for it, and now they're suing for damages.

Damages range from $0 to $3.000.000.000 based on similar suits against Cisco depending on the %-damages awarded, and whether enhanced damages apply according to this table below I found on a related investor-subreddit:

https://preview.redd.it/lqbij5s2tefc1.jpg?width=939&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79ef0d3898063c812718ad779ab9865bae2ca324

Cisco has tried to invalidate Paltalk's patent at the USPTO. The USPTO gave them the finger and told them the patent is valid, basically spilling the beans that Cisco is worried they're guilty.

Cisco has been stalling and putting up roadblocks for a long time, jury-trial should have been initiated over a year ago, but Cisco kept postponing with various tricks, which, along with the patent-fuckery, speaks for some kind of enhanced damages.

Judge has denied Cisco's latest plea for continuance, trial date is set for april 8th. Apparently Cisco's attempt at an excuse was ""we're getting sued for copyright infringement in 2 other cases that week"", and the Judge got tired of their shit :'D

Paltalk intends to go after Meta and Alphabet after this if they win, so I suppose they're not interested in a settlement if they can just point to a succesful lawsuit and say ""cough up"".

In for around $30K at $2.7 a share here. Sorry if it sounds like a pump'n'dump, I really don't intend to. Just think it's an odd/fun instance of having a ""Judgment Day"" on a stock like that.

197,GOOG,Why I don't think NVDA party gonna last,"I know I know - you all think NVDA can reach higher than the sky, but here is why I say they don't. In fact, here is why I say they have already outburnt their rocket!  
Look at the list below.   
there are only 5 companies at the $1T club, and number 6 and 7 are fighting their asses off to get in. now lets talk about ALL of them, and why NVDA isn't one of them:  


1. MSFT has just this week gained supremacy and passed AAPL. There's no argue why MSFT is one of the top 5 companies in the world. They control more than 60% of all OS on all computers on the entire planet, they have access to us all with their products, and they control 22% of could services world wide with Azure. billions of users world wide uses products they 100% own, and profit of with no middleman anywhere. That's dominancy! That's not talking about LinkedIn which is considered to be the best professional social network, and they sure as fuck monetize this.
2. AAPL since they dropped Intel's processors for the M1 and later M2, they control end-to-end of their production process and have roughly 50% market share of wealthy users world wide, plus 26% of mobile users globally. Not sure if they truly invented it, but they have perfected the subscription profit model, and controlling the spending of their huge users base fiercely! And I bet there's a hidden report out there showing they control the majority of the top dome of socio-economic group. BTW a friend of mine working as senior full stack at MSFT told me they gave him a MacBook when he started working for Microsoft. He's developing MS-Office on a MacBook!!!!! 
3. Saudi-Aramco - I know shit about them, but they control oceans of oil and you know.... oil is oil
4. Google - 98% market share for online searches. plus, over 70% global market share of mobile OS and 12% share of  cloud service. All in-house and 100% owned by Google. Oh yeah, and don't forget about Youtube. Oh BTW - do you drive much? did you know that to avoid competition, Google bought Waze too?
5. AMZN - Well to be honest, I don't believe they have a strong valuable market place anymore and I am pessimistic about their retailing now days. In fact I heard somewhere (and I can't find it now) that they lost almost $10B on their forward sellings in 2022, BUT!!!! they earned over $20B off advertising on site which covers the returns and customer's care. we can argue about that, but we can't argue about the crown jewel of AMZN - AWS!!!! 33% of all data on could, is located on an AWS server. You know NFLX, DIS, and WBD streaming services? Along with Amazon prime, they are all located on the same fucking servers!!!! In fact, unless you're watching Youtube or AppleTV, if you're watching streamers, you're watching it off an AWS server! 
6. NVDA - let's roll back to it later
7. Meta - I do hate that evil empire, but there's no argue that there's no other company with as much user data as they have. Between Instagram, Facebook, whatsapp - if you want to talk or meet someone, it's probably through one of their platforms, and they monitor it.
8. Tesla - I hate Elon! I think he should be in jail for violating at least 10 SEC regulations. But he's still out there and roaming. I won't argue that TSLA is A-Z solution to car manufacturing. Everything is In-house as well, and the marketing expenses are 0!!! But in a world where everybody are looking for autonomous vehicles, Elon's got the most data collected in the world. When they talked about creating a center control for autonomous driving, they suggested Tesla will be the center since they have the biggest data centers dedicated for it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now lets get back to NVDA - 10 years ago, they were nothing. A great product for a special segment of hardcore computer users willing to spend $200-$500 on hardware no one else even knows needed.  
Back then Intel was God and AMD tried biting on them. But got no where close.   
Then AI kicked in, and engineers found out GPU are better to teach the modules rather than CPU and guess who's the best GPU manufacturer? wait no!!! It's not NVDA! They have never manufactured a single processor. They don't have a single factory. They do it all with TSMC (number 11 on the list, but around 1/3 the value on NVDA). 

Ok so they have the best design. Fuck!!! no they don't!! They use ARM technology to design their processors ($74B market cap). And why ARM are so important? well because couple months ago, NVDA wanted to buy them, so the US regulator looked this deal up, and found out these 2 companies are the only 2 companies to design such technologies and by buying them, NVDA will basically eliminate the competition, and be a full monopoly on ARM architecture processors. so how come one company is worth $74B and the other $1.4T??? because they design the best AI training processors.

WAIT!!!! FUCK they don't!!!!! haven't you heard?? AMD just steamrolled them with Frontier ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontier\_(supercomputer)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontier_(supercomputer)))  


AMD has had the best week in their life!! how good? $250B good. That's still 1/6 of NVDA.  
And wait, I mentioned Intel several times before, but what's the deal with them? Well in a nut shell, they have dragged behind. They used to have an enormous market share of processors in the market and they got cocky and neglected R&amp;D while the rest rushed to innovate. But even though you are probably reading this on an Intel based computer, or have one at work/home, and they used to be the sole suppliers for Apple computers, Intel at it's peak was worth $273B (Jan 31st 2020). Still fraction of NVDA's worth. And in opposed to NVDA, ARM and AMD - Intel has always owned their own factories, meaning their worth should combine NVDA and TSMC together!!!!

So the question remains - WTF??????

Chinese companies including Alibaba (BABA), Baidu (BIDU), Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY) (OTCPK:TCTZF) and even startups such as Baichuan and Zhipu are developing their own AI models in an effort to compete with large language models, or LLMs, from the likes of Microsoft (MSFT)-backed OpenAI, and others.

The draft guidelines aim at ""seizing the early opportunities from the development of the AI industry"", the ministry said.

The ministry also said that 60% of these prospective standards should be aimed towards serving ""general key technologies and application development projects"".
Furthermore, it targets to have more than 1,000 companies to adopt and advocate for these new standards.

Companies around the world are developing their own LLMs. Meta Platforms' (META) Emu Video, Emu Edit, AudioCraft, SeamlessM4T, and Llama 2, Alibaba's (BABA) Tongyi Qianwen 2.0 and Tongyi Wanxiang, Baidu's (BIDU) Ernie Bot, OpenAI's text-to-image tool DALL·E 3, Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL) unit Google's Bard, Samsung's (OTCPK:SSNLF) Gauss, and Getty Images' (GETY) model called Generative AI by Getty Images, are some of the LLMs, among the many, being developed.

200,GOOG,"Google, Amazon, and Unity are among the tech companies implementing layoffs to start 2024","Google, Amazon, and Unity are among the tech companies implementing layoffs to start 2024, echoing trends observed in 2023. Tech firms persist in cost-cutting, efficiency improvement, and adapting to a cooling labor market. The U.S. unemployment rate stands at 3.7%, a near 50-year low, yet recent months have seen a slowdown in job gains. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employers added 105,000 workers in October, 173,000 in November, and 216,000 in December, below the 2023 monthly average of 225,000.

 Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) confirmed on Thursday that it is laying off hundreds of staff across its voice assistant, hardware, and engineering teams. A Google spokesperson mentioned organizational changes, including role eliminations globally, aligning with product priorities.

Fitbit co-founders James Park and Eric Friedman are reportedly leaving the company after Google's $2.1B acquisition in 2021, amidst competition with the Apple (AAPL) Watch. Alphabet also made several cuts in 2023, including an announcement in January to eliminate roughly 12,000 jobs.

Unity Software (NYSE:U) announced a 25% staff cut this week, aiming to restructure and refocus its core business for long-term and profitable growth. Approximately 1,800 employees are impacted, with the company unable to reasonably estimate costs associated with the reduction until the first quarter of 2024. Despite revenue growth, Unity has struggled to turn a profit, leading to a 20% decline in shares over the past six months.

Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) plans to cut several hundred employees in its media units, including Prime Video and MGM Studios.

Like tech counterpart Alphabet, Amazon made various employment cuts in the previous year.

Xerox (NASDAQ:XRX) announced a 15% reduction in its workforce in the first quarter of this year as part of a restructuring plan. The plan focuses on improving and stabilizing the core print business, increasing productivity through a new Global Business Services organization, and directing Digital Services and IT Services capabilities towards more profitable markets.

202,GOOG,Google - The AI Juggernaut Poised to Explode," 

Hey degen,

I'm super bullish on Google (Alphabet Inc., $GOOG) and I'll tell you why. Google is a dominant player in AI, and their AI fleet is just insane. They're killing it in every aspect of artificial intelligence, and if you're not paying attention, you're missing out on potentially massive gains.

Let me break it down for you:

1. AI Drug Discovery: Google's DeepMind is revolutionizing the pharmaceutical industry with its AI-powered drug discovery platform. They've already made $3 billion in 2024, and this is just the beginning. Imagine the potential for growth in this sector alone.
2. AI Phone: Google's Pixel lineup is already a strong contender in the smartphone market, but with their AI capabilities, they're poised to take it to the next level. Expect their market share to grow and bring in more revenue.
3. AI Chatbot Gemini: Google's AI chatbot is giving other chatbots a run for their money. With its advanced natural language processing and understanding, it's set to become the go-to chatbot for businesses and consumers alike.
4. AI Robotics: Google's investments in robotics, such as RT2, are paying off. As robotics become more integrated into our daily lives, Google stands to benefit immensely.
5. AI Self-Driving Cars: Google's Waymo is leading the charge in autonomous vehicles. With regulatory approvals and partnerships in place, they're ready to disrupt the transportation industry and rake in the profits.
6. AI TPU Chips: Google's Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) are custom-built for machine learning tasks. As more companies adopt AI, demand for these chips will skyrocket, further boosting Google's bottom line.

If Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) can bring its valuation to $1 trillion, then Google's combined AI efforts in drug discovery, chatbot, robotics, and autonomous driving could easily be worth $4 trillion at least.

And that's not even considering their dominance in search, advertising, and other sectors.

TL;DR: $GOOG is a sleeping giant in the AI space. With their unparalleled AI capabilities and diverse product offerings, they're set to explode in value. Don't miss out on this opportunity to invest in the future of technology. BALL Deep for their earning.

204,GOOG,2024 is google time,"Disclaimer: This is not financial advice

Google (GOOG) is one of the most dominant and innovative companies in the world, with a market cap of over $1.7 trillion and a diverse portfolio of products and services. In this post, I will highlight some of the reasons why I am very bullish on Google and why I think it is a great long-term investment.

AI Drug Discovery

Isomorphic Labs,under Alphabet deepmind, has been working on a new AI drug development project with Eli Lilly and Novartis, which is worth $3 billion.  It is more than open ai last year revenue. It just insane. The AI profitability is not on chatbot but AI industry revolution.

Google’s AI drug development project with Eli Lilly and Novartis is a promising venture that could revolutionize the pharmaceutical industry. While the project is still in its early stages, it has the potential to develop new treatments for diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer’s. Investors should keep an eye on this project as it progresses.




Waymo

Waymo is Google's self-driving car subsidiary and one of the most advanced and ambitious projects in the autonomous vehicle industry. Waymo has been operating commercial robotaxi services in Phoenix, Arizona and San Francisco, California, with plans to expand to Los Angeles and Austin, Texas. 

Waymo has a competitive edge over its rivals, such as Tesla, Uber, and Lyft, in terms of technology, data, and regulation. Waymo has logged over 20 million miles of real-world driving and over 20 billion miles of simulation, giving it a huge amount of data to train and improve its AI. Waymo also has a full-stack approach, developing its own hardware and software, and using fully electric vehicles powered by renewable energy. Waymo is also one of the few companies that have obtained regulatory approval to operate without safety drivers in the vehicle, making it the first company to offer a truly driverless service to the public.

Waymo has a huge potential to disrupt the transportation industry and create new revenue streams for Google. Waymo can offer a cheaper, safer, and more convenient alternative to traditional car ownership, ride-hailing, and public transit. Waymo can also leverage its technology to enter other markets, such as trucking, delivery, and logistics. Waymo is estimated to be worth over billions and could generate over $10 billion in annual revenue by 2030. 

Gemini

Gemini is Google's newest and most ambitious AI project, aiming to create a general-purpose AI system that can understand and interact with any type of information. Gemini is built from the ground up for multimodality, meaning it can seamlessly reason across text, images, video, audio, and code. Gemini can also generate creative and innovative content, such as poems, stories, code, essays, songs, and more. 

Gemini is a game-changer for Google and the world, as it can enable new possibilities and applications that were previously unimaginable. Gemini can enhance Google's existing products and services, such as Search, YouTube, Gmail, Maps, and more, by providing more accurate, relevant, and personalized results. Gemini can also create new products and services, such as education, entertainment, health, and more, by providing tailored and engaging experiences. Gemini can also empower users and developers, by allowing them to access, manipulate, and create any type of information with natural language and voice commands.


Conclusion

Google is a powerhouse of innovation and growth, with a strong track record of delivering value to its shareholders. Google has a clear vision and strategy to leverage its AI capabilities to create new drugs, new modes of transportation, and new ways of interacting with information. Google is well-positioned to capitalize on the massive opportunities and challenges that lie ahead in the 21st century. Google is not just a search engine, it is a global leader in AI and a pioneer in the future of humanity.

 I am very bullish on Google and I think it is a must-have stock for any long-term investor. Google to the moon! 🚀🚀🚀.

209,GOOG,Has Alphabet Lost Its Edge?,"TL;DR: Until we can try out Gemini Ultra, it's at least questionable to what extent Alphabet's new AI is really superior to GPT 4. Microsoft also provides an ecosystem into which OpenAI's GPTs fit seamlessly. Where does that leave Alphabet if Gemini Ultra doesn't deliver on all its promises? - Google Search, and here again, Microsoft's Bing is catching up, using the power of OpenAI.

This is not financial advice.

The full text can be found [here](https://medium.com/@chaotropy/g%C3%B6tterd%C3%A4mmerung-has-alphabet-lost-its-edge-b3d78efe3a9c) or [here](https://www.chaotropy.com/gotterdammerung-has-alphabet-lost-its-edge/).

""\[...\]Last week Alphabet announced its new AI Gemini, which will be released in 3 different versions: Nano, Pro and Ultra. According to Google Deepmind’s recent report, Gemini Ultra outperforms OpenAI’s GPT 4 in almost all benchmarks. This claim was supported by a video that turned out to be staged (I wouldn’t call it a fake, as the [real prompts were also published](https://developers.googleblog.com/2023/12/how-its-made-gemini-multimodal-prompting.html)). But if Gemini Ultra is finally superior to GPT 4 and this can be proven by many benchmarks, why does Alphabet continue to hide its prodigy? Why does Alphabet take the risk that OpenAI will release GPT 4.5 in the near future and thus sweep away all the doubts about its superiority?

Hasn’t Alphabet’s innovation lead always been a big part of the investment thesis for Alphabet shareholders? Now Alphabet is trying hard to show that its secret AI, Gemini Ultra, can keep up with the already publicly available GPT 4 — marketing aside, the published report on Gemini Ultra doesn’t say much more than that. An AI is not a gasoline engine. You cannot simply quantify its performance on a scale and then claim that a single-digit percentage difference is evidence of one’s superiority over the other. I am not an expert in quantitative evaluation of AI, but ultimately AI is statistical learning, and in my experience the new generative language models do not always produce reproducible results (especially when generating images). Accordingly, shouldn’t the significance level of the measured performance differences be specified? Couldn’t these rather small differences just be statistical noise in favor of Gemini? Also, the results given are not reproducible because we cannot test Gemini Ultra. And again, if Gemini Ultra is so superior, why can’t we just try it? So has Alphabet lost its edge? I don’t know, but with every statement without a tangible product, my doubts about the company’s superiority grow.

And let’s not forget the giant behind [OpenAI with a 49% stake: Microsoft](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/nov/30/microsoft-join-openai-board-altman), which has a product ecosystem that literally screams for AI implementations. And I’m not just talking about Word, which will soon be writing for us, PowerPoint, which will magically put together our next presentation, or Excel, which will soon be giving no one a headache: Microsoft Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code are widely used integrated development environments (IDEs) and industry standards. Microsoft’s code-generating bot, Github Copilot, has been available as a plug-in since 2021. So if AI is going to have a real impact on business productivity and therefore our economies, it could be through the infrastructure that Microsoft provides. So even if Gemini Ultra beats GPT4 in many ways and OpenAI cannot deliver a better AI in the near future, Microsoft is providing the services where AI could become a real productivity driver.

And what will Alphabet have left if it loses this AI battle? People use its cash cow, Google Search, today largely because they’ve been used to it for two decades — that’s worth a lot, but maybe Bing can slay even that metaphorical dragon with the magic of OpenAI, unaware of its often-called unbeatable dominance\[...\]""",0,31,1702415716.0,2023-12-12T21:15:16+00:00,t3_18gwlrv

215,GOOG,NVDA NVDA NVDA Earnings TODAY!,"Guys, it's finally time. NVIDIA's earnings report is today - after hours. I'm sitting here waiting on what they have to say regarding their new AI developments. Despite the recent shakeups in AI leadership and the U.S. government's tightened chip export rules, NVIDIA seems unfazed, hitting a new all time high.

The hot topic for NVIDIA's management this earnings call will be their strategies to overcome supply constraints and cater to the soaring demand. The analysts are fixed on an expected revenue of $16.2 billion for the October quarter, with adjusted EPS hitting $3.37. The anticipation ramps up for the current quarter, with revenue estimates at a whopping $18.0 billion.

NVIDIA's shares have been on a bullish ride, up 2.3% at $504.20 on Monday. This surge aligns with Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar's optimistic stance, who reaffirms a **$620 price target** on NVIDIA shares, spotlighting the robust demand from U.S. cloud and data center clients. The key challenge, according to Kumar, is the supply of GPUs, which are literally the lifeblood of NVIDIA's dominance in the AI chip market.

Their GPUs, crucial for parallel computations needed in AI model training, are at the forefront of the AI revolution. The high-end H100, launched earlier this year, quickly turned into a sought-after resource, thanks to the burgeoning interest in generative AI. The announcement of the H200 Tensor Core GPU, expected in Q2 2024, is already stirring talks of a new wave of demand.

NVIDIA's pace in releasing chips is also noteworthy. Moving from a two-year to a one-year product cycle for AI chips, NVIDIA is set to unleash more high-end AI products in 2024 and 2025. This strategy could be a game-changer in maintaining their market dominance.

In the backdrop of NVIDIA's stock hitting a record high of $504.09 per share, the upcoming earnings report is more than just numbers. It's a snapshot of NVIDIA's stronghold in the 2023 AI narrative. Here's a quick look at what Wall Street expects versus last year's performance:

- Revenue: $16.1 billion expected, a significant leap from $5.93 billion in Q3 last year.
- Adjusted EPS: $3.36 expected, up from $0.58 in Q3 last year.
- Data center revenue: $12.82 billion expected, a major jump from $3.83 billion in Q3 last year.
- Gaming revenue: Expected to hit $2.7 billion, up from $1.57 billion.

Amidst these projections, the fourth quarter revenue guidance is critical, with expectations set at $17.8 billion. NVIDIA has been shattering expectations, and Wall Street is eager to see if this trend continues.

However, not all is smooth sailing. The stock experienced a hiccup post-August report as valuation concerns and China's chip restrictions posed challenges. NVIDIA's SEC filing indicates minimal near-term impact from these restrictions, and analysts like Stifel's Ruben Roy expect similar reassurances in the earnings call.

NVIDIA's role as a market momentum driver is undeniable. As a member of the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks, including Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, and Tesla, NVIDIA has helped propel the collective gains of these giants by over 70% this year.

Evercore ISI's Julian Emanuel's advice to investors: brace for ""post-NVDA volatility,"" as the stock's performance post-earnings could set the tone for the market. In essence, it's NVIDIA's world, and we're just trading in it.

So there you have it, guys. It's not just them playing the AI game, they're literally in control of it. Due to the high strike price, NVDA calls are a little too expensive for an ""earning"" play. So I'm gonna suggest a call spread. Let's just *assume* it goes up 5%. What type of call spread would we need for max profit? I'd grab a NVDA 11/24 500c for 1830 and sell the 525c for 905. This basically means you can grab the spread for $925. If it were to go up 5%, that means potentially 170% profit. 

With previous earnings, it's moved way more than 5% on average, so this should be an okay bet. Although still expensive. Keep in mind, like my other posts: this isn't financial advice. I'd like to just show people the type of stuff we tend to look at when trying to attempt an earning play. This hopefully will help you with future earning plays too.",28,87,1700595819.0,2023-11-21T19:43:39+00:00,t3_180pijx
216,GOOG,"ZM earnings today, what's in the cards?","Zoom Video Communications (ZM) will be releasing their stuff today, so we get to see how they've fared this recent quarter. Wall Street expect them to report earnings per share of $1.08. Revenue of $1.12 billion, a slight increase of over the prior year quarter when the company reported $1.10 billion.

Zoom’s forecast for the January 2024 fiscal year calls for revenue of between $4.485 billion and $4.495 billion, up 2%, with adjusted profits of $4.63 to $4.67 a share. Consensus estimates call for revenue of $4.492 billion and earnings of $4.68 a share.

With the coronavirus emergency over, the company's share price has been on a rollercoaster, lads. We're talking cutthroat competition and growth hitting the brakes. But here's the kicker: Zoom's gotta level up in the corporate jungle if it wants to keep its revenue game strong. The company has been seeking to grow by moving beyond its flagship web meeting service. It has added software for contact centers, webinars, chat, and email, plus new artificial intelligence (AI) tools, among other things.

But growth remains slow. The stock has retreated 5% so far this year, with the Nasdaq shooting up 36% amid buzz over generative AI technology. Today, Zoom is likely to post its sixth-straight quarter of single-digit revenue growth.

But, on the plus side: Zoom Video has about $6 billion in cash on its balance sheet, they're sitting on a treasure chest boys, and with this we should expect more acquisitions. In a research note previewing the quarter, Morgan Stanley analyst Meta Marshall, dropped some knowledge in a research note: the stock isn’t likely to move much until investors feel more confident about the company’s “online” business, the smaller customers who flocked to the platform during the pandemic. Marshall's playing it chill with an Equal Weight on Zoom.

Another key question, Marshall mentioned, is when some of Zoom’s fresh toys might spur a reacceleration in the company’s enterprise business. And she also wonders when Zoom might use its strong balance sheet to make strategic acquisitions. As mentioned earlier, Zoom has $6 billion in cash and short-term investments, equal to about 31% of its market capitalization.

**Important Factors**

Zoom’s fiscal third-quarter performance is likely to have gained from steady demand for products like Zoom Video Webinars, Zoom Rooms and Zoom Phones. An expanding portfolio of solutions is expected to have aided customer growth in this soon-reported quarter.

The company’s AI related advancements and partnerships in the fiscal third quarter are noteworthy. Zoom adopts a federated approach to AI, utilizing its own exclusive large-language AI models as well as models from renowned AI companies like OpenAI and Anthropic.

In the to-be-reported quarter, ZM threw down its generative AI digital assistant into the mix. Rather than increase revenue, Zoom Video expects AI tools to retain customers. At its annual Zoomtopia user conference in early October, the company said it will not charge customers for use of its AI Companion. That's right. They dished it out FREE for the Zoomers with paid accounts. Talk about a power move! This is totally expected to be a key growth driver. Its capabilities include meeting/chat summaries and smart recordings.

In this conference, the company announced new platform innovations that leverage robust AI capabilities aimed at simplifying the workday by providing efficient communication and collaboration tools.

Zoom Video is racing to build more artificial intelligence tools into its business communications platform. Zoom Video recently backed off from a change in its terms of service for platform users that would have enabled it to gather data to train AI models.

Set for release in 2024, Docs is an AI-powered workspace that can be used for documentation, project tracking and management tasks.

Meanwhile, recently told its employees to report to its offices on a more regular basis. Amid Covid-19 emergency, demand for Zoom videoconferencing software surged as businesses told employees to work from home.

Also, Zoom morphed into a social phenomenon as making video calls became routine for consumers to keep in touch with family and friends. Remote learning and needs in telemedicine also boosted demand for Zoom Video's cloud-based services.

The availability of Zoom Clips, which allows users to easily record, edit and share high-fidelity short-form video messages, both internally and externally, is likely to have aided enterprise customer growth in the to-be-reported quarter. The company also announced the launch of Notes, a fresh workspace designed for creating and collaborating both before, during and after meetings.

Zoom Video aims to integrate AI into more products. At the Enterprise Connect conference in March, Zoom Video announced the expansion of a workplace collaboration platform. Called Zoom IQ, it summarizes chat threads, organizes ideas, drafts content for chats, emails, and whiteboard sessions and creates meeting agendas.

In May, Zoom announced an investment in AI startup Anthropic to support research roadmaps. Anthropic's AI model will be integrated into Zoom's Contact Center platform.

Zoom Video in July rolled out Zoom Workforce Management, which improves agent productivity by automating/optimizing agent work shifts and monitoring agent performance.

The consensus estimate for enterprise customers in the fiscal third quarter is currently pegged at 221,336.

One key to Zoom's success has been a ""freemium"" business model. Zoom's basic video-calling package is free. They put a limit on the number of participants in a group call and the length of meetings. Zoom software gets high ratings for ease of use and simplicity following earlier video services that provided jerky images and out-of-sync audio. The company’s freemium business model helps it win customers rapidly, whom it can later convert into paying customers. In the fiscal second quarter, customers contributing more than $100,000 in revenues in the trailing 12 months grew 17.8% to 3,672.  

These customers accounted for 29% of revenues, up from 26% in the year-ago quarter. The momentum is expected to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter, the number most likely well above 3,700 now. 

A ""Zoom Meeting"" refers to a videoconferencing session hosted on its cloud infrastructure. Paid Zoom business plans cost $15 or $20 per employee and require minimums of 10 or 50 seats.

Zoom Phone, a cloud-calling product rolled out in 2019, lets customers set up group internet phone calls without video. The Zoom Phone replaces traditional business PBX phone systems.

""Zoom reached 5.5 million paid phone seats at the end of 2023, up over 100% year-over-year,"" said Baird's Power. ""The company expects that to become a 10% revenue segment early this year and perhaps as high as 25% in the future.""

However, the company has been facing significant competition from the likes of Cisco, Microsoft and Google Meet. This might have led to a loss in small and medium-sized business customers, which is likely to have hurt top-line growth.

But let's talk competition, specifically with Microsoft. Sales growth slowed for the ninth-straight quarter as the company adjusts to slower product demand in the post-coronavirus emergency era. See, I'm left wondering when decelerating sales will hit a bottom.

Zoom's cloud-based software sets up video calls, with chat tools available. Also, customers can easily share content. Microsoft and its Teams communications tools are pretty much offering the same and are Zoom's major rival in the business market. Microsoft is upgrading its products with technology from startup OpenAI.

The company in early March said company President Greg Tomb, a former cloud computing executive at Alphabet's Google, will leave. They also mentioned in Feb. 7 that they will cut 1,300 jobs, or about 15% of its workforce.

As the coronavirus crisis eases, retaining small businesses as well as corporate accounts will be one key to Zoom's success. For customers with one to 10 employees, renewals are expected to slow as the economy reopens and shelter-in-place orders lift. There's expected to be less turnover of larger customers.

In the business market, Zoom rivals include RingCentral (RNG), Cisco Systems, Google and others. Growth in annual recurring revenue for business customers with contracts topping $100,000 is one metric to monitor.

In July 2021, Zoom Video and Five9 (FIVN), which automates call center services, announced a deal to merge. The all-stock deal was originally valued at $14.7 billion. But the companies terminated the agreement on Sept. 30.

Zoom Video aims to be a player in the contact center market with its own products and services.

**What to do for earnings?**

Over the last 2 years, the shares averaged a move of 7.4% with earnings, regardless of direction. Options currently are pricing in a bigger-than-usual move tho. I'm going to consider this a lotto play, and grab calls: 11/24 70c @ 1.42. Why? Because I believe it's really time that they turn things around with their AI usage and increasing customer base. If earnings are bad, it's simply not going to crash low enough for puts to be profitable. However, with expecations pegged at where they are, calls might be the move here. Keep in mind, like my other posts: this isn't financial advice. I'd like to just show people the type of stuff we tend to look at when trying to attempt an earning play. This hopefully will help you with future earning plays too. Later this week, we have NVDA.",264,29,1700513382.0,2023-11-20T20:49:42+00:00,t3_17zyl2x
217,GOOG,Amazon Earnings: The Boomer Play that Could Print 🚀💰,"Alright, buckle up degenerates, here comes Amazon's earnings rollercoaster. Is this the meme stock of the month? Nah, but it could be the boomer play that prints. Let's break it down. 🚀 Amazon is set to report earnings today, the company's had massive earnings growth this year, beating EPS estimates by 44% and 89% in the last two quarters, respectively. Today, the quarterly earnings are expected to come in at an EPS of $0.60 on $141.5 billion in revenue. $127.1 billion the previous year.

Jeff Bezos might've shot himself into space, but his money-making behemoth stays grounded on Earth. The company is doing well with amazon shares are up 42% this year, topping the Nasdaq’s 23% gain. So, the big question: YOLO some calls for earnings or nah? After Amazon’s growth slowed dramatically last year due to rising inflation and economic concerns, expansion has ticked up a bit in 2022, though it’s still weaker than usual for the company. Amazon’s retail business is expected to show some improvement from consumers tepidly resuming discretionary spending. 

Analysts are expecting growth of 11% in the third quarter, marking a slight acceleration from the past couple quarters. E-commerce sales boomed during the pandemic, then slowed as shoppers returned to physical stores. I'll be focused on the results of Amazon's Prime Big Deals Days event, as well as guidance for consumer spending during the holidays.

**Cloud Computing**

Being the world's largest cloud provider and a significant profit driver for amazon (nearly 70%), all eyes will be on Amazon Web Services (AWS). 

Amazon’s cloud computing business is a concern for a lot of people in wall street, as growth in AWS has been slowing in recent quarters. Google just reported earnings and one of its misses was in the cloud revenue department—could this mean that AWS is taking more of the lion's share. However, you'd think the frenzy around generative artificial intelligence is leading to bigger workloads in the cloud, which should be a boon for AWS and its rival public cloud vendors. Looking at Microsoft (MSFT), sales in their Azure cloud unit grew 29%, faster than the 26% expected by analysts. This is considered bitter sweet as this could be eating into AWS' market share. 

I expect stable AWS revenue, but want to know more about higher energy costs and rising competition. They currently hold a 40% share of the cloud services market last year, compared to Microsoft's 21.5% and Google's 7.5%.

**Ads**

Let's talk ads. Amazon's ad sales are right up there with Alphabet (GOOG) and Meta (META), so it will be interesting to see how it fared this quarter. One of Amazon's fastest-growing business sectors. Alphabet beat ad-sales estimates by almost $1 billion this quarter and Amazon will look to report similar success.

**AI**

Microsoft has OpenAI, we all know this. Amazon wanted in on the AI space and and in Sept announcing a deal to invest up to $4 billion in OpenAI competitor Anthropic. Additionally, in April, Amazon launched Amazon Bedrock, a service that allows users of Amazon's AWS to create generative AI applications.
During the earnings call, I'm interested in hearing if there are any gains from its AI efforts. As mentioned earlier, the rise in AI causes more people to use cloud computing services like AWS. 

**What do the experts say?**

BofA Global Research analyst Justin Post mentioned stuff that I've already written up here in a research note, stating that AWS is the Street’s top focus area, with some third-party sources suggesting that demand has decelerated. He's specifically betting on 12.5% growth for AWS, but cautions that a number in the 11% range would likely trigger selling. But further ads that a number above 13% would likely spur the stock higher.

On top of this, Post says aggregated credit and debit card data suggests online spending rose 1% from a year ago in the quarter, a two point acceleration from the June quarter. And he notes that “ad spending checks were also constructive.”

“We see retail upside potential driven by logistics efficiency, ads, fee increases, and easing comps,” Post writes “while we think AWS can accelerate in Q4 with more acceleration in Q1 2024 on an easing optimization cycle and incremental AI demand.” Post keeps his Buy rating and $174 target price on the stock. Mind you, the stock is literally at $118 right now. 

**What to do for earnings**

My magic 8-ball says both revenue and EPS could outpace the estimates. Alright Degens, here's the play: I'm grabbing some AMZN 10/27 125c @ 2.04 each.  If Amazon rockets just 7%, those calls are hitting pay dirt. 🚀

221,GOOG,"Nvidia blowout earnings ripple across tech, highlighting winners and questions.","Nvidia earnings have been a significant milestone for the tech industry, with a 101% increase in revenue to $13.51 billion. The company has become a bellwether for the AI boom, with an ecosystem where a win for Nvidia can come in tandem with wins for some additional companies. The Magnificent Seven, including big tech companies like Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft, as well as banks and financial institutions that invested directly, are expected to benefit from Nvidia's rise.

Amazon and Microsoft are particularly key due to their existing cloud partnerships with Nvidia, while Meta has an existing consumer-focused partnership with the chipmaker. Snowflake and VMware also emerged as winners, both of which have relatively new enterprise partnerships. Alphabet's shares rose as much as 3% after Nvidia's report, and Nvidia and Google Cloud announced a partnership emphasizing AI hardware in March.

Despite the AI hype, Nvidia's earnings show some key resilience. Competitors such as Qualcomm, Intel, and AMD saw their shares in the red on Thursday, with AMD experiencing the steepest decline. However, there is still room for all in the current market, as competition is fierce and they have different strengths and weaknesses.

Critical infrastructure for the AI boom is also shifting, with companies having to revamp their existing systems over time to meet the demand for AI. Data centers, at the center of operations for most tech companies, are in flux as the demand for Nvidia chips is re-forming how data centers will operate and grow. As AI pushes data center buildings to be larger and denser than ever before, companies must adapt to meet the growing demand for AI. ",0,4,1692959537.0,2023-08-25T10:32:17+00:00,t3_160vfpw
222,GOOG,"Apple, Amazon and Coinbase Earnings Today","Today we have a pretty massive line up with earnings, and I wanted to offer my 2 cents for those looking to play either Apple or Amazon

**Apple**

Let's start with AAPL. Apple’s stock is up over 51% so far in 2023, hitting all-time highs. I honestly see it as a safe haven with strong cash flow, even tho investors have been worrying about slowing demand for consumer goods, including PCs and smartphones. During the call, I'll want to hear about how the current quarter, which ends in September, is shaking out. Apple hasn’t given guidance since 2020, citing uncertainty, but they will provide us with some data points that they can use to determine whether Apple sees overall sales growing or shrinking. Wall street is expecting 

* Revenue: $81.7 billion

&gt; iPhone revenue: $40.2 billion

&gt; iPad revenue: $6.4 billion

&gt; Mac revenue: $6.3 billion

&gt; Other products: $8.3 billion

&gt; Services: $20.7 billion

* EPS: $1.19 per share

The company’s forecast will be more important. It may give clues as to whether global economies are set up for a “[soft landing](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/15/collective-embrace-of-soft-landing-economic-scenario-extends-2023-rally-after-welcome-drop-in-cpi.html)” after two years of interest rate hikes. The June period is typically Apple’s slowest quarter of the year, while its fourth fiscal quarter often captures back-to-school laptop spending, a few days of new iPhone model sales — which usually come out in September — and shows Apple’s momentum heading into the holiday season.

“What will matter most will be management’s September quarter,” wrote Morgan Stanley analyst [Erik Woodring](https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/erik-woodring) in July, adding that he expects Apple to guide to year-over-year revenue growth again. 

I'm eager to see Apple give data points on India sales. Apple CEO Tim Cook traveled to the country in April and spoke about hopes for significant growth in the region. India became one of Apple’s top five iPhone markets during the quarter.

I don't know if people follow professional analyst notes, but [D.A. Davidson analyst Tom Forte wrote this week,](https://dadavidson.com/Who-We-Serve/Equity-Capital-Markets/Our-Professionals/ECM-Profiles/ArticleID/1208/Tom-Forte-CFA) “On the call, we look for additional details on its expansion in India, including its retail and manufacturing presence.” 

But Apple’s older growth driver, China, is likely to be closely watched as well. Greater China — including Hong Kong and Taiwan — is Apple’s third-largest sales region, and it has reported two straight quarters of revenue decline, even as the region reopened after years of strict Covid lockdowns.

“In our conversations, most investors feel that a soft China could pose a risk to the numbers and further commentary, but we feel that Apple’s position in China is on a solid footing and that the company is likely to see only a small if any decline in its iPhone sales,” wrote [Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar](https://www.pipersandler.com/about/people/harsh-kumar). Kumar said if China ends up being weak, it could be offset by strong sales momentum in India.

Apple mainly manufactures in China and investors will want to hear that the company has overcome many of the supply chain snags that have hampered sales over the past two years. If Apple stockpiled parts and has enough to make what it needs to produce, it could help margins.

Maybe people are tired of me tossing random names in the air, but a lot of these analysts are paid to do the heavy-hitting research, so it's only beneficial to read up on what they say. J.P. Morgan analyst [Samik Chatterjee](https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/samik-chatterjee) thinks it is time to start viewing Apple in a new light, and I agree with this sentiment. Rather than seeing the tech giant as a product cycle company, it should be seen as a ‘resilient earnings compounder.’

“Apple’s diversified revenue drivers within Hardware, as well as the natural diversification of the replacement cycle for hardware product on account of a ~2 bn installed base of devices has moved the company incrementally away from being dependent on a product cycle relative to iPhones or any other hardware,” the analyst opined.

Moreover, the Services segment has grown significantly over time and is now well diversified in terms of its drivers, allowing it to achieve double-digit growth (excluding currency impact) even during challenging economic times. This “inherent diversification” positions the company next to other “’earnings compounders’ with resilient drivers.”

It also makes it easier to justify the premium multiple the stock has been trading at for the last six months, one which it is likely now to hold on to. Apple’s profitable services division includes monthly subscriptions such as Apple Music, warranties under AppleCare, fees from the App Store, advertising revenue from search licensing agreements with Google, payments from Apple Pay and other products. I'd like to see Apple’s services business grow regularly and smoothly, because the margins on services are so much higher than when Apple sells hardware. In particular, many analysts want to see services re-accelerate after a few quarters of weak growth because of lagging App Store software sales.

Apple suggested a 5.5% year-over-year increase in services](https://www.pymnts.com/apple/2023/apples-services-segment-slows-to-5-5-growth-rate/), and [FactSet’s](https://www.factset.com) estimates more than $20.7 billion in revenue. In fact, given the fact Apple is “well positioned to drive higher confidence from the upcoming earnings print as an ‘earnings compounder’ that continues to drive resilient performance,” Chatterjee thinks a new price target is due.

As for what to look out for in the report, Chatterjee expects the major highlight will be the pivot back to revenue growth on a year-over-year basis in F4Q23 (September quarter), boosted by “typical seasonality” in the majority of the business’ segments but with an additional kick from “moderating currency and improving Services growth rates as advertising rebounds.”

“The return to growth will mark Apple cycling past the most uncertain macro backdrop with resilient revenue and earnings, and well positioned to drive robust growth in a normal macro,” he said.

“For the Services business, we expect year-over-year revenue growth to accelerate from the +5% level expected in [fiscal third quarter,] with our checks suggesting online advertising has improved,” [Deutsche Bank analyst Sidney Ho](https://stockanalysis.com/analysts/sidney-ho/) wrote. But analysts will want to see Apple signal more growth than that. 

We also need to keep in mind, Apple's AI acceleration. These analysts will also likely ask about artificial intelligence, given the industry wide obsession with the technology. There's also been a recent [Bloomberg report](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-19/apple-preps-ajax-generative-ai-apple-gpt-to-rival-openai-and-google) that Apple is developing a ChatGPT-like AI model internally. Don’t expect Apple to gush about what it’s working on internally, though. “With the official intro of Vision Pro, we expect Apple’s updated comments on its AI aspirations to be a focus (albeit likely very high-level),” wrote [Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers.](https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/aaron-rakers)

Apple reports its results by product line, which can give us a look into which businesses are thriving and which ones are in a down cycle. IPhone, iPad and Mac sales are all expected to be down on an annual basis, with iPad sales projected to drop nearly 11%. Wearables, the product category with headphones and Apple Watch — and what will likely be the reporting category for Vision Pro when it goes on sale — is projected to decline less than 1%. However, the experts expect Apple’s services business to grow 5.2% on an annual basis, which would be a bright spot for the report.

Given these details, I'm fairly sure AAPL calls will be the play today, but with high IV, I'm gonna grab a spread. I can buy the 8/4 192.5c for $300 and sell the 195c for $196. This means I can grab the spread for $104 each. Ideally, if AAPL were to go up just 1.8%, this means the spread can be sold at 140% profit. 


**Amazon**

Okay, next is AMZN where analysts are predicting an earnings of $0.35 per share, significantly better than the loss of $0.200 per share in the same quarter of the previous year. In terms of sales, they anticipate an increase of 8.46% over the prior year quarter. For revenue, we expect them to report $131.49 billion. With regard to the current fiscal year, analysts forecast a profit per share of $1.61. Data from [refinitiv](https://www.refinitiv.com/en).

While revenue growth remains steady at Amazon, [it’s been stuck in the single digits](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/20/amazons-post-bezos-experiment-hasnt-gone-exactly-as-planned.html) for five out of the past six quarters. That trend is expected to continue, as analysts are looking for 8.5% growth in the second quarter and a number just slightly higher in the third period.

I believe Amazon’s expanding Amazon Web Services (AWS) will have a large impact on its second-quarter performance. Amazon Web Services has been a growth driver for years, but the pace of expansion is slowing as customers clamp down on spending due to an uncertain economic outlook. In the first quarter, AWS sales increased roughly 16%, the slowest growth since 2015, when Amazon began breaking out cloud revenue. 

In the second quarter, AWS made its purpose-built security data lake, called Amazon Security Lake, generally available. The service aids in the simplification of compliance monitoring and security data management across hybrid and multi-cloud environments by centralizing an organization’s security data across AWS environments. It introduced a new configuration for Amazon Aurora, namely Amazon Aurora I/O-Optimized, which provides improved price performance and predictable pricing for I/O-intensive applications. It unveiled three new capabilities for its threat detection service called Amazon GuardDuty - GuardDuty EKS Runtime Monitoring, GuardDuty RDS Protection and GuardDuty Lambda Protection. AWS also announced the general availability of its no-code service, called AppFabric. I expect all these initiatives to have helped Amazon win customers. This, in turn, is expected to have boosted AWS’s second-quarter revenues, whose consensus mark stands at $21.49 billion, up 8.9% from the year-ago reported figure.

However, Brian Olsavsky (Amazon’s finance chief) warned in April that the company expects to see more of the same in the second quarter in cloud. In addition to cloud, profit margins will be an area of emphasis for investors, as well as artificial intelligence, a focus for companies across the sector.

“The key question will be whether management suggests that with the timing of the optimization cycle, AI workloads, and easing comps that AWS is likely to start showing revenue growth acceleration beginning in Q3,” analysts at [Evercore](https://www.evercore.com), who have the equivalent of a buy rating on Amazon, wrote in a note this week. “We don’t know.”

AWS rivals Microsoft and Alphabet last week reported solid results in their cloud businesses, beating analysts’ revenue expectations. But both companies said they continue to see organizations moderating their cloud spend. 

Last week, Amazon hosted an AWS Summit, where the company announced updates related to generative AI, including a service that uses the technology to transcribe and summarize doctors’ patient visits. Amazon’s results will give investors a sense of whether the company’s ongoing cost-cutting efforts are beginning to bear fruit. Evercore analysts said they expect to see improving margins in Amazon’s retail business in the second quarter, as “comps against ’22′s massive cost spikes, capacity utilization recovers, and newfound efficiencies from the regionalization of Amazon’s retail operations kick in.”

Recent data released by the company showed improving delivery speeds and efficiencies in Amazon’s fulfillment network. The company said it’s made significant headway on its efforts to establish one- and same-day delivery as the standard for Prime members, while also bringing costs down. Also during the quarter, Amazon hosted its annual Prime Day discount bonanza, which they claim as its “biggest ever.” Amazon’s guidance for the third quarter could give a glimpse into how much Prime Day lifted sales.

Amazon’s advertising business is becoming increasingly important to the company’s financials. Several industry surveys have indicated a slow rebound in the digital ad market may be underway. Meta showed better-than-expected results last week, but rival Snap fell short of sales expectations and gave a weak forecast for the current quarter.

With Amazon's earnings, it's certainly a toss up. But I'm learning bullish. I'm gonna go ahead and do another call spread, getting AMZN 130c at $380 a pop, and selling the 135c at $195 each. This means I can grab the spread for $185 each. If AMZN were to go up with earnings, just 4.8%, this play will profit 170%. 

**Coinbase**

Last and certainly least, there's Coinbase. I don't know if anyone rememebers but the SEC [sued the crypto exchange](https://blockworks.co/news/sec-sues-coinbase) not too long ago. The lawsuit is in regards to them allegedly operating as an unregistered exchange. 

At today's earnings, investors are gonna be listening to hear about trading volumes and adjusted EBITDA. Coinbase improved its net loss from $557 million during the fourth quarter of last year to $79 million in the first three months of 2023. The exchange generated $284 million in adjusted EBITDA — earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization — last quarter compared to a $124 million loss in the prior quarter. 

“Unlike last quarter [when] we saw potential upside going into the print, this quarter is the opposite,” said [Owen Lau](https://sps.columbia.edu/faculty/owen-lau), an executive director at Oppenheimer and Co. Lau mentioned that he estimates Coinbase’s trading volume will have fallen 34% quarter over quarter — from $145 billion to $91 billion. The exchange’s adjusted EBITDA could fall about 90% to $29 million, he added.

[Mark Palmer](https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/mark-palmer), an analyst for Berenberg Capital Markets, said the [Ripple ruling](https://blockworks.co/news/xrp-ruling-sec) and the prospects of a spot [bitcoin ETF](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/07/03/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-application-refiled-naming-coinbase-as-surveillance-sharing-partner/) approval have given some investors “a false sense of confidence” about Coinbase’s prospects.

In addition to weak transaction volumes, Coinbase’s results are likely to reflect lower interest income from USD Coin (the digital stablecoin). The exchange, which [introduced the stablecoin](https://www.coinbase.com/) with payments company Circle in 2018, offers users rewards by holding USD Coin on Coinbase.

Interest income rose to about $240 million during the first quarter, up from $182 million during the prior quarter. Of that $240 million, $199 million was USD Coin, Coinbase said in its Q1 shareholder letter. But USD Coin’s market capitalization has fallen by more than 50% over the past year.

“We see no reason why Coinbase’s guidance for the balance of the year should be particularly encouraging,” Palmer said. “While interest income on USD Coin has been a tailwind for Coinbase since interest rates started to rise, the continued decline in the stablecoin’s market cap raises real questions about the extent to which that income will support its operating performance going forward.”

Morningstar Analyst [Michael Miller](https://www.morningstar.com/authors/2412/michael-miller) said he will be paying particular attention to Coinbase’s expenses and non-trading revenue sources. So will I. The exchange’s operating expenses fell to $896 million in the first three months of 2023, a 24% drop from the previous quarter. The figure represented its lowest level of expenses since the first quarter of 2021. 

“Coinbase has signaled that it’s pulling back on its investment spending during weak cryptocurrency markets and what it chooses to continue to invest in will indicate what it sees as priorities,” Miller mentioned. 

Still, Coinbase said in its May shareholder letter that it expected second quarter expenses to increase due in part to higher legal expenses. Miller said he is also keeping an eye on any momentum Coinbase reports related to reducing its reliance on transaction fees. 

Coinbase’s so-called subscription and services revenue, the bulk of which was interest income last quarter, also includes blockchain rewards from staking and custodial fee revenue. Combined, the category brought in about $362 million last quarter, compared to $375 million of transaction revenue.   

“Coinbase being selected to provide custodial and surveillance services for a potential Blackrock ETF is a win on this front,” he said. “But it remains to be seen how much subscription and service growth Coinbase can create outside of interest income, which is now facing major headwinds.” 

Guidance around the road forward as Coinbase deals with the SEC’s lawsuit could be helpful as well. The SEC has said it would oppose any motion brought by Coinbase seeking to dismiss the commission’s lawsuit. Honestly, any update related to Coinbase’s regulatory issues would very interesting but I’m not really expecting anything material to come out with earnings.

As a result of my research, I'm just gonna go ahead and get puts. COIN 8/4 90p is $420, and the 85p is trading at $242. Which means I can get a put spread for $178. Like the previous plays, I'm buying the more expensive contract, and selling the cheaper one as a hedge. If the stock were to drop 7.1%, this spread will profit 181%.",66,40,1691091224.0,2023-08-03T19:33:44+00:00,t3_15hdkrl

229,GOOG,Space companies,"I like to read books about space history ( Gemini, Mercury, Apollo missions, space shuttle missions, etc ), entrepreneurial projects and I also like to track the prices of space stocks. Since I am not an expert in either space history nor how space companies work, maybe some of you are. This post is not some good dd, just a discussion.

Some of the space stocks with market cap bigger than $500 million are the following:

Boeing Company
Ticker name: BA
Market cap: $127.436 billion (NYSE)
Share price: $211.83 (market close on 29/06)


Lockheed Martin Corporation
Ticker name: LMT
Market cap: $115.848 billion (NYSE)
Share price: $457.44 (market close on 29/06)


Rocket Lab USA, Inc
Ticker name: RKLB
Market cap: $2.862 billion (NYSE)
Share price: $5.98 (market close on 29/06) 


Virgin Galactic Holdings, Inc
Ticker name: SPCE
Market cap: $1.195 billion (NYSE)
Share price: $4.23 (market close on 29/06) 
 

Of course, there are other companies whose market cap is less than $500 million - that's why I didn't mention them - and private space companies like SpaceX and Blue Origins.

In my humble opinion, the majority of revenues generated by these companies originate from contacts with governments and corporations.

Space tourism is virtually nonexistent. AT LEAST FOR NOW

Also, I have noticed that during the last 3 decades, software-related companies like Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Meta dominate the public interest, with their stocks dominating the market accordingly. 

Do you think that one day space companies will overshadow public interest, and their stocks will become major components of indices like S&amp;P 500, in the way Apple and Microsoft are today?

234,GOOG,What you need to do for ORCL earnings tonight.,"Oracle (ORCL) kicks off a relatively light week for corporate earnings reports, with the enterprise software firm set to disclose its fiscal fourth-quarter results today after close. The stock is currently trading at record highs today, up 5.8% at $116.28 at last glance, and earlier hitting a peak of $117. Analysts, on average, expect ORCL to unveil earnings of $1.58 per share, up 2.6% year-over-year (YoY), on $13.7 billion in revenue (+15.9% YoY). ORCL is expected to report a YoY increase in both profit and revenue for FQ4, which will partly be due to the integration of health information technologies firm Cerner, the acquisition of which closed in November 2022. Over the last 2 years, ORCL has beaten EPS estimates 75% of the time and has beaten revenue estimates 75% of the time. However, in early March they posted mixed FQ3 results and provided an outlook that generally failed to excite investors.

J.P. Morgan Securities raised its price target to $109 from $93 ahead of the results, and over the weekend, Wolfe Research upgraded the shares to ""outperform from ""peer perform,"" citing tailwinds related to artificial intelligence (AI). Over the last 3 months, EPS estimates have seen 23 upward revisions and 0 downward. Revenue estimates have seen 9 upward revisions and 11 downward.

ORCL has finished three of its past eight post-earnings sessions higher, including a 10.4% pop last June. This time around, options traders are pricing in a next-day swing of 12.6%, regardless of direction, which is higher than the 5.2% move the stock has averaged over the past two years. 

The Cerner deal (mentioned earlier) from 2022, in an all-cash transaction amounting to $28.3 billion or $95 per share, had boosted revenue estimates for ORCL, but also said that it had had a lagging effect on earnings per share. It's expected to have bolstered the company’s position in the lucrative healthcare domain. In the third quarter of fiscal 2023, Cerner contributed $1.5 billion to the total revenues driven by continued strength in the Fusion, Autonomous Database and OCI services. For the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023, total cloud, including Cerner, is expected to grow from 51% to 53% at cc and from 49% to 51% in USD.

ORCL's cloud results will also no doubt be closely watched. ORCL is a distant fourth in the cloud computing market behind Amazon's (AMZN) Amazon Web Services, Microsoft's (MSFT) Azure and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOG), but brokerages such as Guggenheim have highlighted the benefits from such a position.

Accelerated digital transformation, along with the continuation of remote work and mainstream adoption of the hybrid/flexible work model, is likely to have driven demand for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) services and the company’s other cloud-based applications in the to-be-reported quarter. Continued momentum in back-office cloud-based Fusion Human Capital Management solutions, along with NetSuite Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Fusion ERP applications, is expected to have favored ORCL’s quarterly performance.

Oracle announced on May 18 that it would join the Scheduling Standards Consortium to boost logistical effectiveness. The company's ERP division may have benefited from the move of many sizable SAP clients to Oracle Fusion ERP cloud and rising deal success in a number of industries, including banking and healthcare.

The strong uptake of Oracle's Dedicated Region Cloud and next-generation Autonomous Database, underpinned by machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities, may have helped the bottom line. Gen2 public cloud architecture is seeing significant momentum for autonomous databases.

It's increasingly obvious that calls are going to be the play for this one. I'm going to buy the 120c for 3.60 and sell the 125c for 2.30. This means I can get the spread for $130 and potentially make 3.8x gains on this one. Keep in mind tho, as with all my other posts, these are entirely meant to just educate people about what we tend to look for when making an earning prediction. It by no means can be considered financial or investment advice.

236,GOOG,"Earning plays for CRWD, CRM, AI, OKTA, and JWN","*Let's do the shotgun approach.* I'm going to be discussing all five earning plays in one post, and then put my conclusions at the end. All of these stocks are putting out earnings today, after hours. Yesterday I posted about HPQ going down, and it went down, puts up ~80%. So let's get into the details of this post. 

Starting with **CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD)**, where analysts are predicting earnings of $0.509 per share compared to earnings of $0.310 per share in the same quarter of the previous year. They are also expecting the company to report $677.4 million, an increase of over the prior year quarter when the company reported $487.8 million. With regard to the current fiscal year, analysts expect a profit per share of $2.33, while the previous year saw a profit of $1.54.

CrowdStrike’s first-quarter fiscal 2024 results are likely to reflect the benefits of the continued solid demand for its products, given the healthy environment of the global security market. The increasing number of people logging into employers' networks has triggered a greater need for security and might have spurred the demand for CRWD’s products in the fiscal first quarter. A strong pipeline of deals indicates the same.

Stellar revenue growth in subscriptions might have contributed significantly to the first quarter’s top line. Further, the increasing number of net new subscription customers may have acted as a tailwind.

Moreover, CrowdStrike’s collaboration with Amazon Web Services (AWS) is an upside, benefiting the company from its products’ availability on the AWS platform. The expansion in the volume of transactions through Amazon’s AWS Marketplace, growth in co-selling opportunities with AWS salesforce and the uptake of AWS service integrations are likely to have contributed to CRWD’s earnings in the to-be-reported quarter.

However, elevated expenses for enhancing sales and marketing capabilities and increased investments in research and development are likely to have weighed on the company’s fiscal first-quarter bottom line.

Next is the software-as-a-Service (SaaS) provider **Salesforce (CRM)**, wallstreet expects CRM to post adjusted earnings of $1.61 per share, which is on the higher end of the company’s guidance and nearly double that of the Q1FY23 figure of $0.98 per share. CRM has consistently beaten earnings expectations in the [past eight quarters](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/crm/earnings), with a strategically built portfolio covering virtually all aspects of digital transformation. So far this year, the stock has gained 59.9%, outperforming the S&amp;P 500's 10% gain.

Similarly, the analysts expect Salesforce to post revenue of $8.18 billion, which is also on the higher end of the company’s outlook and represents a 10.4% year-over-year growth. However, sequentially, the revenue expectation shows a modest decline of 2.4%.

Salesforce’s first-quarter performance is likely to have gained from its focus on building and expanding relationships with leading brands across industries and geographies. Also, significant growth opportunities in the public sector are expected to have been a tailwind in the fiscal first quarter.

The company’s ability to offer integrated solutions for customers’ business problems is likely to have been a key growth driver. The firm’s products, like Trailhead and myTrailhead, are helping companies through their transformation processes and increasing business scale with modern technology.

Salesforce’s quarterly performance is likely to have benefited from the robust demand environment as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation. The customer relationship management software provider’s focus on introducing more aligned products per customer needs is expected to have boosted its top line in the quarter.

Also, the acquisitions of Slack, Mobify and Vlocity are anticipated to have aided CRM’s top line during the to-be-reported quarter. Growth across its four major cloud service offerings, Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Platform, and Other and Marketing &amp; Commerce Cloud, is anticipated to have boosted Salesforce’s subscriptions and supported its revenues.

However, a decline in software spending by small and medium businesses amid the macroeconomic uncertainty due to the pandemic and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war might have affected Salesforce’s fiscal first-quarter performance. Further, stiff competition from Oracle and Microsoft is a concern, along with forex headwinds.

On May 26, Goldman Sachs analyst [Kash Rangan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kashrangan/) reiterated his Buy rating on CRM stock ahead of its earnings report. Rangan has set a price target of $325, implying a massive 50.8% upside potential from current levels.  

Rangan is highly optimistic about Salesforce’s quarterly winning streak and the potential tailwind from the artificial intelligence (AI) race. Even so, the analyst cited that this will be the first time that CRM will recognize a sequential decline in subscription revenue.

Despite that, Rangan noted, “As a system of record with a plethora of customer data that can help train its LLM (large language models), CRM can benefit from Generative AI. As the macro begins to inflect, we see CRM being well positioned as it realizes the benefits from sales efficiency efforts and workforce reductions of recent quarters.” Salesforce said it will integrate its [generative AI](https://www.crmscience.com/single-post/generative-ai-and-salesforce-transforming-business-processes-with-innovative-ai-solutions) Einstein GPT into every facet of the company - sales, service, marketing, commerce and IT interaction. Pricing details were not disclosed.

I know everyone wants to hear it, next is **C3.ai (AI)**. There's no denying it, the growing popularity of artificial intelligence, in particular ChatGPT, is more than just hype. It is real. As you may have noticed, one company that's riding high on the AI wave is C3.ai, which has seen its stock more than doubled as interest among investors surge. The stock has gone on a breathtaking run over the past thirty days, rising close to 90%, compared with the 3% rise in the S&amp;P 500 index. On a year-to-date basis the performance looks even more astonishing, skyrocketing 194% compared with the 10% rise in the S&amp;P 500 index. How much higher can its shares go?

C3.ai is benefiting from the increasing adoption of its services, including C3 Generative AI Product Suite, C3 AI Ex Machina (wasn't that a movie?), C3 AI ESG and C3 AI CRM. An expanding product portfolio is expected to have remained a key catalyst in driving demand for the company’s fully-integrated AI products in the fiscal fourth quarter.

During the to-be-reported quarter, the company made significant development toward its Generative AI platform, facilitating the ease of use and the capability of its enterprise AI applications. This is expected to have driven the top line.

C3.ai has been benefiting from strengthening industry and technology-specific partnerships. From its industry partnerships with the likes of Baker Hughes in oil &amp; gas &amp; chemical markets and Booz Allen in government defense sector, C3.ai has been leveraging domain expertise to expand its customer footprint.

With its tech partners, C3 has been benefiting from strength in its sales capabilities besides tech and product functionality. Partnerships with the likes of Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Azure and Accenture are expected to have driven the top line in the to-be-reported quarter.

Aside from recently announcing that its generative AI product suite is now available as a public offer on Alphabet's Google (GOOG , GOOGL) Cloud Marketplace, the company also issued preliminary results that included positive cash flow in FQ4. This suggests that the company’s $800 million cash currently on its balance sheet will grow. Its management has sought to change the company’s business model, shifting the business away from short-term revenues to a transaction-based pricing method, while boosting long-term revenues by growing its customer base.

Those initiatives appear to be working with growth rates starting to re-accelerate. CEO Thomas Siebel said, ""Since we announced C3 Generative AI, we've had intense interest from current customers and prospects to get these capabilities deployed and in use across their systems.” The product suite features enterprise search, allowing businesses to search across their database to locate and retrieve relevant information. On Wednesday, the company will look to prove that it is here to stay and has a sustainable path towards profitability.

For the three months that ended April, Wall Street expects the Redwood City, Calif.-based company to post a per-share loss of 17 cents on revenue of $71.32 million. This compares to the year-ago quarter when the loss was 21 cents per share on revenue of $72.32 million. For the full year, the loss is expected to be 46 cents per share, narrowing from 73 cents a year ago, while full-year revenue of $265.67 million would rise 5.1% year over year.

The company still has a lot to prove and important questions to answer. Namely, does it have a strong enough moat to establish a leadership position in enterprise AI software? C3.ai ended Q3 with 236 customers, the same total reported at the end of Q2. In other words, there has been no sequential growth in the customer base, suggesting there’s a lack in competitive advantage and/or product interest.

As noted earlier, a few quarters ago, the company moved towards a new pricing model to help onboard new customers at a lower startup cost. This will allow the company to charge more when these same customers utilize the software at higher levels. As a result of the pricing change, there was a noticeable dip in Q3 revenues. Although the company surpassed consensus estimates, producing Q3 revenue $66.67 million, the figure declined 4.45% year over year.

The Q3 adjusted loss of 6 cents per share did surpass estimates by 16 cents. Despite the nearly 5% dip in revenues, the stock soared higher. Investors looked beyond the current numbers and instead focused on the fact that the trough in revenues had been reached. The belief is that the company’s consumption-based pricing model is now poised to generate even more revenue than the subscription model it once used. As such, the guidance the company provides today will be a key factor in the stock’s near-term direction.

Strong demand for the company’s Enterprise AI software, driven by accelerated digital modernization across major industries, is expected to have aided fiscal fourth-quarter performance.

**Okta, Inc (OKTA)** is next. analysts expect earnings of $0.118 per share compared to losses of $0.270 per share from the same quarter last year. They expect Okta to report sales of $511.0 million, an increase of 23.16% over the same period last year. Looking at the full year, analysts expect a profit of $0.760 per share. In the previous year there was a profit of $0.040 per share.

The company’s first-quarter fiscal 2024 results are expected to reflect the benefits of increased use cases of identity solutions and an expanding product portfolio.

Okta is expected to have experienced strong demand for its Workforce and Customer Identity solutions. Continuous innovation in its solutions have helped Okta score notable enterprises such as Sonos, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, MassMutual and OpenAI. Its products’ ability to automate processes, secure data and reduce costs has been another positive.

Demand for the company’s solutions has been strong due to the deployment of cloud and hybrid IT, digital transformation projects and the adoption of Zero Trust security. The momentum is expected to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter.

These factors are expected to have expanded the customer base in the fiscal first quarter. In the fiscal fourth quarter, Okta added 550 customers, bringing the total customer count to 17,600, up 17% year over year. Customers with more than $100K in Annual Contract Value increased 27% year over year.

However, Okta is expected to have faced challenges in execution and heightened attrition. Challenging macro environment and unfavourable forex are potential headwinds. These factors are expected to have hurt its fiscal fourth-quarter prospects.

Finally, let's take a look at **Nordstrom (JWN)**. Their first-quarter fiscal 2023 results are expected to reflect the significant impacts of decelerating demand trends. Reduced consumer spending amid lower income groups, stemming from the tough macroeconomic environment, has been hurting revenues across both banners. Analysts expect losses of $0.105 per share compared to losses of $0.060 per share in the same quarter of the previous year. They also are expecting the company to report $3.16 billion, an decrease of 11.59% over the prior year quarter. With regard to the current fiscal year, analysts expect a profit per share of $1.87, while the previous year saw a profit of $1.69.

Management expects the impact of the winding down of Canada operations to hurt revenues in fiscal 2023. The impacts of the closure are likely to get reflected in the fiscal first-quarter results. I anticipate a decline in revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. Moreover, I expect sales to decline for both the Nordstrom banner and  the Nordstrom Rack segment.

In order to maintain healthy inventory levels, Nordstrom has been undertaking additional markdowns. The higher markdowns have been weighing on gross margin, which is likely to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter.

However, the company is committed to enhancing customer experience via its Closer to You strategy, optimized supply chain and better efficiency. These endeavors are expected to have slightly offset the aforementioned declines.

Nordstrom has been focused on technology advancement by boosting e-commerce and digital networks, supply-chain channel improvement, and marketing efforts. The digital business has been witnessing gains from improved digital traffic across both Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack, as well as increased utilization of Buy Online, Pick Up In-Store service. Its mobile app has also been performing well. Alongside these, the integration of Rack.com into [Nordstrom.com](https://www.nordstrom.com/) is anticipated to have contributed to the company's top line in the to-be-reported quarter.

**So what to do for earnings?**

Just to keep it sweet and simple, I'm getting calls on CRWD, CRM, AI, and OKTA. And I'm getting puts on JWN. I don't expect all of them to hit, I just like to throw my money on the table and see what flies.

241,GOOG,My high conviction trade of the year: Full ported into META calls (looking good on both ends: technical and fundamental),"TLDR:
Macro: Risk on sentiment + rate cut buy the rumor repricing + end of year FOMO/FOMU trade 

Technical: price reclaiming 600s and hitting EMA + crypto/small cap rally hints a good possibility that market is risk on again.

Fundamentals: META’s valuation now might be considered expensive in a bear market, BUT it’s a bull market now and META is CHEAP!

And position and trade plan at bottom.


—————————————————————-

Buying into strength today as META has reclaimed the 600 level and touching EMA. 

Market sentiment is also recovering as we are getting back to risk on. (Crypto and small cap rally is a good indicator) 

On top of that the rate cut sentiment is coming on again. With the fed in trumps hands, it’s really unlikely that a cut won’t happen so I definitely will buy into a fed cut induced rally (and my prediction is this rally will continue into fomc week with a sell the news event following the cut &amp; market end off the year with a rally). 

This makes me believe that the year end FOMO and FOMU trade is back on again. Where portfolio managers go long on mag 7 or AI names that are underperforming ytd with hopes of a catch up trade.

Fundamentally, META is not cheap but certainly not expensive here:

EV to EBITDA: sub 15x (it’s almost half as cheap as GOOG here - I agree GOOG is a much better business but 50% discount in a bull market riding the AI secular trend? I call this deep fucking value)

also, META trades at 35x FCF. This may seem expensive if you are value investor. But again, we are in a bull market (so story drives price growth, not valuations) plus META has the first mover advantage in the AI secular trend and is still founder led. So I’d argue they deserve a premium and I say this valuation is more than justified here. And let’s compare other mag 7: GOOG 53x FCF, MSFT 45x FCF, AMZN 232x FCF, NVDA 58x FCF. So yeah it’s deep fucking value here. 

Price Target: If we are being conservative here and have META touch its previous valuation highs of ~42x FCF, the price will be $725. (A 20% upside)

PE ratio is pointless as different companies have different capital structures plus it doesn’t work on high growth names so I just look at EV EBITDA and P to FCF instead.


Position &amp; Game plan:

2026 April $700 call a few METU calls across different accounts with May 2026 expirations.

As my modest target price is $725, I’ll be writing month out covered calls with strike above my target to offset some theta and lower my cost basis. 

As for take profit and exits, I will exit around late Jan - mid Fed to avoid theta decay acceleration. If META goes above $700, I will monitor the position closely and exit the trade as soon as day candle breaks below EMA. 

Stop loss: I’ll exit if META breaks below 570, in which case I’ll wait for April lows and then get back in again.

243,GOOG,Took 2400% gains on some of my GOOGL calls — holding onto the rest,"Very sad to report that I've sold my Dec 19 300C options that I bought in February. Expiration was fast approaching and wanted to lock in gains so I don't bleed EV in the last month to expiry.

Cost basis was $3867 (40 contracts), sold for $92773. These options were actually down very bad during liberation day, which is what caused me to double down and put another 25k into the GOOGL LEAPS you see here. So I'd like to thank 🥭 for giving us such a fantastic entry point.

I told myself I wouldn't sell anything until my original $33,000 position either hit 1M or I was getting LTCG, and today I reached the 1M milestone so allowed myself to lock in some gains on my shortest expiration positions.

I want to have it on record that everybody called me an idiot for holding onto these when GOOGL was at 285 last month.

Remaining position attached. I still have high conviction in the GOOGL/QQQ trade. Compared to its peers, GOOGL is still obviously undervalued, the only risk I see is market risk so have opened some index puts to hedge.

Last time I posted I had 20 people in my DMs asking regarded ass for advice so I'll put the only advice I have here so you stop spamming me:

1. Do not manage your portfolio daily, manage it monthly at most. **Every time you buy OR sell an option you are losing money to the market makers.** Everybody on here will give advice to ""lock in gains"" or ""roll to a new position"" if you're up, when in reality you're bleeding money to hedge fund algorithms every time you make any trade at all. Trading options at all is inherently a losing game, but if you want to minimize the money you pay to market makers, simply make fewer trades. If you start with 1k and put it into options: imagine paying like 3-10% of that to market makers every time you reinvest it (on average) — so if you reinvest the same money 5 times, you are essentially 'paying' 15-40% of your expected value to algorithms/market makers. I sometimes think that the hedge funds themselves are in this sub astroturfing to get people to trade daily because it's so profitable for them.
2. Human emotion is your greatest weakness. There are algorithms that are literally designed to manipulate retail traders into panic buying or selling. **If you ever want to make a trade, WAIT 24H** and if you still want to do it the next day, go for it. Retail traders never have knowledge before the big funds, so there is NEVER a rush to make a trade. Rushing will only hurt you.",4401,280,1764015580.0,2025-11-24T20:19:40+00:00,t3_1p5ry1p

245,GOOG,"Wanted to write a DD, but now it's public: Intel to Secure Microsoft, Tesla, Qualcomm &amp; NVIDIA as Advanced Packaging Customers in the U.S.","One of the things that I wanted to mention in ""my last DD"" on INTC was that they have advanced 3D packaging technology, meaning they can put together different nodes into one chip - giving them an edge when it comes to combining ""the best of the best"". And how Lip-Bu Tan will use it to push INTC foundry business further

It looks like it's now going to become a reality.

I ofc. loaded up on more INTC Leaps during this bearish market, hope you fellas did too.

I might mention one more thing here a wild speculation:

Lip-Bu Tan is on the board of a company called ""AnnapurnaLabs"" an Israeli startup building AI chips, acquired by Amazon. Trainiums and Gravitons are ARM based chips produced by this company and there was a deal (closed by Pat Gelsinger in late 2024) that we didn't hear about for a long time. Amazon did mention something about upgrading their current lineup the same time more rumors about AI clients surfaced in mid 2025.

Could be pure wild speculation, but maybe they've decided to take advantage of the **improved voltage droop from 18A tech**, since they keep mentioning how the new lineup is more power efficient. Voltage droop is especially important for inference chips, fingers crossed.

Other than that we might see Maia II in '26 which is currently speculated to be produced fully with 18A tech.

To those people who kept asking about yield of the new fabs - it's improving by 7% each month.

Along with new Intel CPU specs leaked:

I'm looking at some nice greens during this otherwise bearish market.

Lastly to the people still doubting Intel's power. Keep in mind that AMD has gained nothing from the data center market. Looking at their numbers they at best sold 1.5BLN worth of CPUs (they on purpose don't distinguish between GPU and CPU data center sales, however given the fact that it's 2:1 in price it's safe to say CPU is close to 1.5BLN) - compared to INTC 4.5BLN datacenter CPU sales.

Demand for AMD GPU/CPUs is low, Amazon itself reported this some time ago:  
[https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amazon-amzn-says-it-not-seeing-enough-demand-amds-ai-chips](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amazon-amzn-says-it-not-seeing-enough-demand-amds-ai-chips)

AMD CPUs are only sold with AMD GPUs, that's how they get their CPU sales. Datacenters always prefered Intel over AMD due to superior software and hardware support, the new Amazon 1GW Datacenter is a prime example of that.

AMD GPUs are not in demand, because unlike NVDA - no academic mind knows how to use it properly, the software support is shit and NVDA spent close to 20 years spoon feeding academics with CUDA. They are only competing with other inference chips:  
\- AMZN - Trainium  
\- GOOG - TPU  
\- MSFT - Maia II  
\- Honorable mentions: Qualcomm, INTC, etc.

The only demand for AMD GPUs is from a deal with OpenAI that is entirely dependent on AMD stock price being in the highs. Those who know me, know that I bought AMD puts and keep on buying them until AMD is trading at 160.

Entire blockchain DEFI ecosystem is built on TEEs from Intel (usually SGX, but are switching to TDX). AMD is not trusted in the cybersecurity domain and probably never will be. Intel is always going to dominate. So any banking / DEFI system built in cloud using TEEs is built with Intel.

There's a lot more that I could mention, but no point in doing so. People who understand the semiconductor industry will see that INTC is here to shine and thrive.

Lastly according to the CFO the foundry business is expected to be breakeven by 2027, however given Lip-Bu Tan's philosophy on ""underpromise, overdeliver"" I wouldn't be surprised if they were breakeven sooner.

252,GOOG,$SEZL Long and strong,"*Summary*: $SEZL is down 67% from its peak because the market is full of paper-handed morons who can't read. They panicked over a seasonal take-rate dip and ""muh subprime"" fears from 2008. Meanwhile, the actual business metrics are accelerating, it's run by a founder-CEO who hasn't sold a share, and it's printing cash (123% rev growth + 35% net margin in Q1). The smart money PDF says this is a 5x to 8x bagger from here. Get in before the suits figure it out. 🚀



Part 1: Why did it dip? (aka Why is everyone else an idiot?)
So, your wife's boyfriend saw the chart and panicked. The stock rocketed to $185 after stellar Q1 earnings, then crashed to $63. The market thinks the party's over. Here's why they're wrong:
 
The ""Take Rate"" Misunderstanding:
   • The smooth-brains saw revenue growth ""slow"" from 123% in Q1 to 76% in Q2 and shit their pants. They think this is a ""massive deceleration."" WRONG.
 • That insane Q1 take rate (13.0%) was seasonal. All the Christmas shopping (Q4 GMV) gets paid off in Q1, artificially juicing the revenue number. This happens every year.
   •While the paper-hands were looking at the seasonal rate, the actual business was accelerating. GMV growth sped up from 64% in Q1 to 75% in Q2. Active consumers and transactions are also up.
   •Management also chose to invest in growth, like pushing the ""On Demand"" product (which has a lower take rate initially) to get more subscribers later. This is called playing the long game.
 •The ""Subprime"" Ghost:
   All the boomer analysts hear ""subprime"" and think the Big Short is happening again. This is not your daddy's 30-year NINJA loan.
   •These are 6-week, small-dollar loans. The company gets its first read on a loan in 14 days, not 14 months.
   •The risk isn't the whole economy; it's just new customers. The repeat customers (who make up most of the volume) are proven, loyal cash-cows.
   •Sezzle can literally just turn off the new-customer tap if they see trouble. They have a big red button. Your bank doesn't.
 •The Hindenburg (R.I.P. Bozo) Attack:
   Remember Hindenburg? They tried to short this company into the ground in November 2024. Sezzle won, and Hindenburg literally went bankrupt. This company already had its near-death experience when it had 1-2 months of cash left and clawed its way back. Your short thesis is nothing.

Part 2: The Rocket Fuel (Why we're going to the moon 🌕)
This isn't just a comeback story; it's a ""print you tendies"" story.
 •Papa Charlie (The Main Character): This isn't run by some diversity-hire suit. It's run by founder-CEO Charlie Youakim. He's a tech-oriented engineer who owns a massive stake and has never sold a single f*cking share. He even took a margin loan instead of selling. That's how bullish he is. 💎👐
 • It. Prints. Money.
   This isn't some cash-burning Silicon Valley trash. This is a profitable growth monster.
   Q1 2025 Stats:
   * Revenue Growth: 123% YoY
   * Net Margin: 35%
 * It Broke the Goddamn Chart:
   You see that ""Rule of 40"" image? That's the benchmark for high-quality SaaS companies. A score of 40 is good.
   $SEZL's score in Q1? ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY-EIGHT.
   It's not on the chart. It's the red arrow pointing to the dot in another dimension. It's the most profitable and fastest-growing, yet the market gives it the lowest multiple.


 •We Are EARLY:
   Why is this golden goose so cheap? Because nobody knows it exists.
   •It has only 4 analyst ratings. For a $2.5B company, that's criminally low.
   •It's based in Minnesota, not some SF soy-den. The Wall Street dweebs haven't found it yet.
   •The really big money is just starting to get in. Renaissance, Goldman Sachs, and Joel Greenblatt all bought in last quarter.

The market is giving you a 67% discount on the best-in-class, most profitable, founder-led company in the entire BNPL sector. The thesis paper I read is modeling a 5x to 8x MOIC (that's ""Multiple on Invested Capital,"" for you apes) by 2027.
This isn't financial advice. I'm just an idiot on the internet. But I'm an idiot who can read.

257,GOOG,NBIS earnings DD (Ne🅱️ius),"TLDR/summary: NBIS is going to skyrocket after upcoming q3 earnings due to multiple upcoming bullish catalysts as well as ANOTHER upwards revision in ARR guidance for full year 2025.

If you check my post history you will see a previously written speculation post on q3 earnings. This post will include a lot of the same information, with some extra. But positions have been rearranged to reflect real earnings date of 11/11 instead of 10/31 like I had originally thought. I did take a 3k loss due to this mistake earlier (that’s ok I’m fucking stupid)

Company overview

Nebius Group N.V. (NASDAQ: NBIS) is a European AI-infrastructure company based in Amsterdam with R&amp;D hubs across Europe, Israel, and North America. Originally part of Yandex N.V., Nebius became its own pure-play “neo-cloud” infrastructure firm after spinning off all Russian assets in 2024.

Today, Nebius operates data center infrastructure and provides a full-stack AI cloud platform (“Nebius AI Cloud”) serving startups, research labs, and hyperscalers.

Nebius’s “platform as a service” (PaaS) adds another layer and acts as an alternative to the “infrastructure as a service”(IaaS) models that other Neo clouds use, such as IREN, CRWV, etc

Current CEO Arkady Volozh was co-founder of Yandex. Dig a little deeper into their spin off from Russia and you will understand how talented the Nebius crew is today. They have plenty of experience in large scale cloud and AI systems experience. The only difference now is that they are starting with a clean slate, and access to western markets.
——————————————————————————

Earnings preview

[Q2 earnings](https://assets.nebius.com/assets/a1ea2731-32b4-4b8d-82b4-0557fddadd1a/Nebius%20-%20Financial%20results%20-%20Q2%202025.pdf?cache-buster=2025-08-26T16:52:29.128Z) was incredibly bullish for nebius, with an 2025 ARR guidance being revised upwards from 750m-1b to 900m-1.1b. Not only that, but they saw a 625% increase in revenue YoY. Q2 earnings were released on August 7, 2025.

As you can see from q2 earnings, they were already poised for explosive growth.

[Then, they went and signed a $17.4billion contract with MSFT](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1513845/000110465925088312/tm2525580d1_6k.htm) on September 8, 1 month after their q2 earnings call.

The important thing to remember about the MSFT deal is that this is not instant revenue for NBIS. NBIS must have activated capacity to service the contract prior to receiving revenue from this.

It is extremely unlikely that Nebius’ $900M–$1.1B ARR guidance (which was already revised up from previous) from Q2 earnings included money from the Microsoft deal. That guidance came out in August, while the contract wasn’t announced until september. Companies generally don’t build unfinished or undisclosed deals into official numbers.

Along with that information, please check their 6k (linked above) - “Gpu services will be deployed in several tranches during 2025 and 2026”, meaning that at least part of the revenue from MSFT contract will be baked into 2025 figures. 

Rumor has it that the MSFT contract encompasses 300mW of activated capacity. Nebius guided for 220mW of build out by EOY’25 and 1GW by EOY ‘26. This again indicates that Nebius is ready to start collecting revenue from said contract this year. 

Given that average ARR over the life of the MSFT contract is a little less than 4b/year, if they even capture 1/4 of that in 2025 they will be effectively doubling their previously projected ARR for ‘25

Side note, a deal of this size with one of the biggest hyperscalers shows confidence in Nebius product and Nebius cloud. More companies will likely follow provided they execute MSFT deal well.

——————————————————————————
Other tech earnings 

MSFT, GOOG, AMZN, META will be reporting earnings this week. I expect a lot of chatter regarding increased AI capex spend as well as increased need for more compute from these companies. This will run Nebius price up until they report earnings.

——————————————————————————

NVDA GTC partnership speculation.

NVDA has equity stake in Nebius. Nebius will be speaking at GTC, right after an NVDA announcement for a [partnership](https://www.nvidia.com/gtc/dc/session-catalog/?search=DC51273&amp;tab.allsessions=1700692987788001F1cG#/ ) regarding AI agents and full stack software offerings (sound familiar?) the whole Nebius executive team will be there and will be the first ones to speak at 9:40am after this announcement.

Nebius also teasing that they will be announcing something at GTC and to stay tuned.

262,GOOG,"$10k-&gt;$100k, past 18 months have been crazy","Started contributing to my account April 2024. Started with $5k then added $5k more March 2025.

Major events:

June 2024: Bought my first ASTS shares around $9, that’s been my largest holding and biggest mover ever since. Still adding. Also bought 1300 ACHR shares at $3.

October 2024: Hit big on TSM earnings, had a bunch of calls I averaged down on over the summer. Went from -$5k to about +$7k basically overnight.

April 2025: Low point after the election run up and later decline. Biggest mistake I’ve made so far was letting a successful AMZN calls trade basically go to zero. Lesson learned, will always scale in/out moving forward.

May 2025: Entered my GOOG position. Ended up being my most successful options trade, added more calls on dips, always 6+ months out from expiration. This stock was the perfect storm for a quick run up and ultimately went +$30k on the trade. Still holding some.

Today: Currently my largest trades are JD Jan 26 calls and the rest of my GOOG. Sitting on all my ASTS shares and I won’t be selling any time soon. The calls however are +$8k so those I’ll begin to trim.",921,64,1759775833.0,2025-10-06T18:37:13+00:00,t3_1nzrcx6

Would love to see more Google apps available more easily on the home screen.

Not a easy task going against Microsoft - but lets see how it plays out. They did this with Chromebook in 2011 and made it the biggest laptops for education in the world. A gamble that paid off.

266,GOOG,$TTD DD: The Tendie Desk,"If you’ve seen my last couple posts I’ve been pretty good at picking stocks near the bottom before a bull run. CRDO, NBIS, ENTG, GLXY and most recently MNDY which I did a DD on. The problem is I’m a regard and mismanaged all of them for a loss except MNDY, but I’m rolling those gains into what I present before you today: $TTD. 

TTD is an ad tech company that has received a series of aggressive prison beatings in the market on its way to becoming S&amp;P 500’s worst performing stock of 2025. They act as the Don Draper of advertising, so if you’re a company that wants to advertise on platforms outside of the walled gardens you don’t call each company individually you call TTD and they help you find the best spots for your money across the channels they have access to. Most of TTD’s slide this year is in reaction to the walled gardens (GOOG, AMZN, META) getting bigger because TTD doesn’t have access to youtube, prime video and ig.

[Shanked by Google, jumped by Amazon, and left holding META's lunch tray. ](https://preview.redd.it/j4cdi2znn4qf1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a3a6bef7e1489a97126b63dca60e2c49fe2ff07)

They aren’t taking this lying down, TTD bought back $647 mil between the first two quarters of 25 and have $375 mil left to use under that approval. Buybacks like this are bc the c suite is either putting their dicks on the table and saying “we’re undervalued” or they want to cook the books and boost eps. I don’t care either way because I think they’ll buoy the share price at the 52 wk low. The fed cuts also boost valuation models making future earnings look better for a growth stock like TTD. 

The DOJ vs. Goog ad tech remedies case begins next week. Guilt for Goog has already been decided, this is now about how they will change their monopoly on digital advertising by controlling both the publisher and ad exchange. DOJ is pushing for a breakup of the stack, which would give TTD access to premium inventory and be a huge tailwind. Most of the c suite for TTD has testified at one point in this trial and the CEO said “TTD managed to win in an unfair market, imagine what we could do in a fair market”. Well I’m putting my $$ on CEO Jeff Green’s imaginings. 

[Got flamed last time for posting after my position was already up so this is hot off the press.](https://preview.redd.it/m6lu0fd3o4qf1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d54a33d6a6fbefca78b474a478c3e828bb6b776)

Final considerations are for their new AI tools and the possibility of M&amp;A. Kokai and OpenPath will be fully launched by the end of this year, these are meaningful next gen innovations. Brands using Kokai so far have seen a 43% lower cost per household reach on ads and OpenPath has led to 39% bump in CTV revenue for clients like Vizio. If the remedies case forces Goog to make major changes, the rest of big tech could say fuck it and buy TTD given the current depressed valuation, giving better reach in the open internet and picking up a competitor. Big media like Disney or Roku could also integrate or partner to control supply path and reduce dependency, like what we just saw with Amazon and Netflix. 

Also incredibly small flyer chance TikTok’s walled garden is opened up in the US acquisition giving TTD further opportunity.",104,68,1758290591.0,2025-09-19T14:03:11+00:00,t3_1nl4g6m

276,GOOG,"2.8k to 50k, 1800% Returns Over the Summer","I started with 2.8k in AMD leaps back in February. They were down going into April, but a generational recovery happened and suddenly I was up bigly. Once school ended in June and I had free time, so I sold the leaps, and this is where the real gambling journey began.



My first trades were just random weeklies, for example on the first Monday of July I bought TSLA puts when the line went up and calls when the line went down like a monkey. Believe it or not this was only the beginning of the retardedness.



I read about Donald Jr.’s new SPAC in the daily thread so I decided to invest into CLBR / PEW calls, and was up bigly going into the merger. Then, when the merger actually happened and I got absolutely demolished. This Donald guy had successfully grifted me.



I got mad at the market so I full ported into OPEN since y’all seemed to believe in it, however this time I actually made money. I’m not sure what the fuck I was doing but I bought both calls and puts, sold the calls at the top and then sold the puts after it got rugged in the middle of the day and made back the money I lost. 



The week after that I was feeling lucky I guess and went back to buying random shit (technically I never stopped doing it, there are like 200 other trades that I didn't bother mentioning, but this time specifically was just extra retarded). I don’t even remember why I got 10k worth of AMD calls but apparently I did, and there’s this one day where I was using half my port on SPY 0DTEs for some reason.  



At this point near the end of July I realized that I was being little bit too autistic, so in order to try to be slightly less autistic I went over to check out the value investing sub to and holy shit they’re even more autistic so I gave up and came back to wsb immediately. Saw some guy say that the Google antitrust remedies were coming out soon so I proceeded to full port GOOG calls a few times which yielded the biggest juiciest gains yet and boom now I’m somehow at 50k.



I just started university this year and nearly had to bag fries every summer to pay my tuition due to the fact that I am poor af, but this gain covers my entire degree, so I am genuinely thankful to this community, because without you guys I would not have found out about options.

286,GOOG,Going big on $GOOGL - Web and Ai giant!,"My positions: 1920 shares of $GOOGL. Kept on buying up so don't know what the average price is but around 190s.

Why: $GOOGL $GOOG is arguably one of the best AI companies out there. Google deepmind ( led by demis hasabis) is on par with openai and probably more better. Talent rich, cash rich, growing at scale and expanding.

Moonshots: 
1)Everyone talks about how search will die because of chatGPT etc. No! Earnings for the last 3 quarters have proved re-acceleration in search at almost 11% YoY.

2) YouTube now the most watched form of content. Almost all TV have it and YouTube shorts does 200b of views! Yotube is growing like crazy and content on it is proving to be better then most tv. The new generation will have also grown up on yotube and many have yotube subscription which is also a direct competitor of Spotify- you get free yotube music.

3) GCP - Google cloud. Growing like crazy. Now at $55b run rate. Sundar said they signed more $1B+ deal in the CURRENT quarter, then all of 2024!!! Examples include Salesforce, oracle, OpenAi ( yes them) for compute and GCP. They are growing rapidly due to TPU being super cheap and and cost effective. Constant reinvestment and growth will see them end up with a 100b business in cloud by 2028!!!

4) Gemini - google own LLm. On my benchmarks, this is one of the best models out there. This is being integrated into Google search view Ai overviews + Google ai mode search ( only india and usa have it) try it out. Not only that, they have the best video generation model and world models with Veo 3 &amp; genie 3. Gemini is becoming an enterprise software that many companies are embedding alongside cloud and GCP.

5) stabel growth segments - Google networks are not talked about. Android, play store, Google pixel,  watch and ear phone are in total $50b+ in annual revenue. The upcoming catalyst for this is Pixel 10 release with Google AI embedded in the phone. Google have also entered into the world of VR glasses that will be the most cost effective one. This will be in partnership with eye brand gentle monster who provide hardware for Google software. This will beat Apple ai vision pro and upcoming meta glasses on price point alone.

6) investment - Google are constantly investing into other business and themselves. They have just announced a $9b investment for data centres in Oklahoma. This is in addition to $25b for data centes in usa. They have also announced $6b projection near completion in India- a multi billion industry. They have given all kids in college free google tools and gemini pro to the value of $1B, and have projects going for google fiber for underwater sea cable networks. Rapid expansion across all vertices. They are investing into ai for drug discovery which had began human trials for cancer cures (isomorpic labs) and have constant investments into waymo - which is set to launch outside of USA and begin operations in Japan very soon. A stand alone valuation of waymo is around $150b.

Risk: The doj wants to break up google. They think it's a monopoly. The ruling is due anytime now. Given how unrealistic a break up is likely and could destroy google I don't see it happening. Even the prez of usa himself said he doesn't want them broken up,  he has said google is a innovative American company in tech conference a few weeks ago. I expect some remedial actions out of this which will life alot of risks from google.

Valuation: this is currently trading at cheapest valuation of 20x PE. OR 17x FWD P/E. The next mag 7 close go this is $meta at 29 PE.
A re rating could send $GOOGL on an nvida like run all the way to $280. 

My plays: common shares that I'm selling at $300 + 40k in various calls and leaps. 

Positions from a brokage located outside of Usa/ in nz. ",71,33,1755236432.0,2025-08-15T05:40:32+00:00,t3_1mqos3l
287,GOOG,What if Google bought Snapchat?,"What would be the benefits to $GOOG and to $SNAP?

Ad Powerhouse: Google’s ad tech could supercharge Snapchat’s ads, targeting its Gen Z/Millennial audience for bigger profits.

Tech Boost: Snapchat’s AR (like Lenses) could merge with Google’s AI and cloud, creating next-level features and smoother performance.

User Wins: Snapchat’s Stories and filters could integrate with Google apps (e.g., YouTube, Search), making content easier to find and use.

Social Media Edge: Google could finally compete with Instagram and TikTok by owning Snapchat’s youth-focused platform.

Growth Opportunities: Snapchat could tap Google’s global reach for expansion, plus add e-commerce or creator tools tied to Google’s ecosystem.

\-Trump making boneheaded visit to pressure my king J. Pow into submission

\-I've already bought these puts and can't reverse them before they half in value tomorrow morning

Like yeah, consumer data looks weak, retail earnings are trash, housing is soft  cool we get it. That’s been true for months  But have you actually looked at what moves the market right now?  


Big tech is absolutely ripping  AI isn’t some future fantasy  it’s real spend, real revenue, real margins. Nvda adds $300B in a week, Msft printing, Goog melting up  even Apple finally waking up. That’s literally half the index. And people think the S&amp;P’s just gonna collapse? Lmao  


Every week I see the same doom porn  credit cracks, recession lurking, “this time it’s different”  and yet price action doesn’t care. You know why? Because when stuff does start breaking, the Fed eases. They don’t want a crash heading into an election year. They’ll pivot the second things get messy  
And the fear over rising delinquencies… yeah no kidding. What did you think would happen after the fastest hiking cycle in 40 years? Obviously credit gets tight. But this isn’t 2008. Unemployment is still under 4%, corporate balance sheets are solid, and the system isn’t imploding Chill  


The market’s not pricing in perfection. It’s pricing in “slightly less bad” and “maybe we get cuts”. Yields are easing, buybacks are rolling, and there’s no alternative that yields 30% YTD like $Qqq. Money has to go somewhere  


Truth is, most of you are still traumatized from 2022. You don’t trust green candles. You assume every rip is a bull trap. But markets don’t crash when everyone’s scared. They crash when everyone’s dancing on tables. Right now? Everyone’s still hiding in T-bills and buying puts  
You really think the S&amp;P dumps while Apple is buying back stock like it’s a religion and boomers are auto-buying every paycheck? Come on  


And don’t even get me started on the Fed Powell’s out here praying the soft landing meme becomes real. They’re not raising again. They’re literally looking for a reason to cut. Give them one more bad payroll print and they’ll have the press release ready  
But sure, let me go sell all my longs and load puts because Starbucks missed same-store sales by 1.2%. Brilliant.  
This market isn’t euphoric  it’s hated. And that’s exactly why it keeps grinding higher

318,GOOG,This is why I'm getting AMZN calls for earnings,"Guys! It's finally happening. Amazon is releasing their earnings today. The stock moved down last earnings, up the one prior, down the one before that, up before that. It's been kinda bouncing back and forth. So you might think I'm uncertain this time around, but I'm not. [Link to my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1kbnosv/everything_about_metas_earnings_tonight/) on META. [Link to my RDDT post for today's earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1kcgypg/why_im_getting_calls_for_rddts_earnings_today/). Now that I've established my track record, let's get into it. 

Right now it’s all about tariffs, of course. Has anyone read the recent report that suggested the company might start showing tariff costs on product listings? That resulted in a phone call from Trump to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Predictably, Amazon afterwards denied the claim, stating the proposal was “never approved” and that displaying tariff costs “is not going to happen.” Lmao.

Still, questions linger. [Loop Capital’s Rob Sanderson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rob-sanderson-7b049947/), a 5-star analyst ranked among the top 4% of Wall Street pros, notes it’s unclear how Amazon will deal with all this recent tariff bs. According to management, though, the likely scenario is straightforward: third-party sellers will simply pass on the higher costs to customers.

That, says Sanderson, will have “some elasticity impact on demand but is GMV accretive on a unit basis.” In any case, while it remains to be seen how the company will manage Chinese supply for 1P sales and “how quickly it passes through price increases,” he thinks it is “only a transitory risk at worst.”

Tariff chaos aside, as for what to expect from the readout, Sanderson believes the consumer environment in Q1 remained sluggish but largely in line with expectations, and that Amazon performed well under the circumstances. The Department of Commerce’s proxy for e-commerce (non-store retailer sales) grew 4.2% in Q1, with growth accelerating each month and reaching 6.1% in March. The truth is, retail stores are dying and companies like amazon are picking up the slack. [Online shopping will be a majority of all shopping very soon.](https://optinmonster.com/online-shopping-statistics/) And because of this, AMZN is one of my longer share holds.  

Going back to what the analyst was saying specifically in regards to today's earnings: “This bodes well for 1Q results if directionally correct with management providing guidance off the weakest month of the quarter."" He also thinks these trends have mostly carried into April and that tariff-related volatility has not yet had a significant impact on consumer spending.

As industry checks across cloud service providers (CSPs) indicate sustained positive momentum despite broader macro uncertainty, I believe AWS will deliver solid results today. The consensus margin estimate of 35.7% (a 190 basis point year-over-year decline) could turn out to be conservative, even when accounting for increased CapEx and a revenue mix shift toward generative AI, which I assume comes with lower margins.

This is taking place against a backdrop where the digitization of workflows has become a top priority for execs globally, driven by the rise of generative AI. While mainstream IT use cases for AI are still taking shape, there is an “abundance of demand” from early adopters, and even slower-moving companies are accelerating their cloud migration efforts. As budgets are already funded, Sanderson doesn’t expect significant budget changes unless companies face major spending cuts.

Did anyone see the Google results last week? I did a post on GOOG as well. Their results reinforce this view with strong growth at GCP and commentary on capacity shortages and inability to meet current demand.

Bottom line, ahead of earnings, Sanderson maintained a Buy rating on AMZN shares, while his $285 price target factors in a 12-month gain of ~50%. ([Sanderson’s track record](https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/rob-sanderson)) Like I said, I have shares as a long term hold. For earnings however, I got [AMZN 1/16/26 230c](https://i.imgur.com/odrEvKu.png). This is a position I purchased a while ago, and it's unfortunately down quite a bit. But I think with today's earnings, it'll be good.",24,72,1746128010.0,2025-05-01T19:33:30+00:00,t3_1kchgs2
319,GOOG,Everything about META's earnings tonight,"Meta is releasing their earnings tonight, and because they tend to move quite a bit with earnings, I wanted to see if we could try to bet on it. Either calls or puts.

Tesla generally moves ±10%, but honestly it's kinda a toss up. Looking back, they went up 5.1% after last earnings. But down 4.9% the one prior. Both moves, less than it's average move. Knowing that Meta *tends* to make a big jump *usually* I wanted to draft up a little discussion post to get the ball rolling. See where we stand.

https://investor.atmeta.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2025/Meta-to-Announce-First-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx

As we know, this earnings comes a week after Google's earnings (I did a post on GOOG as well) where the company was able to beat expecations on both the top and bottom lines on the strength of its ad sales. During that company's investor call, Google chief business officer Philipp Schindler said it was too early to comment on the potential economic impact on the current quarter, but did mention that the Trump administration's changes to de minimis exemptions will cause ""a slight headwind to [Google's] ads business in 2025."" 

For the quarter, today Meta is expected to report earnings per share (EPS) of $5.25 on revenue of $41.3 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. The company saw EPS of $4.71 on revenue of $36.4 billion in Q1 2024. [Chart](https://i.imgur.com/qkgqCBJ.png)

Advertising revenue is expected to top out at $40.5 billion, while Meta's Reality Labs segment is set to report an operating loss of $4.5 billion and revenue of $496 million.

While Meta has repeatedly beaten Wall Street expectations in the past few quarters, analysts were disappointed by the first quarter revenue outlook Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg shared at the end of 2024. The company is also planning on spending up to $65bn on AI infrastructure by the end of 2025. Uncertainty over Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs may yet roil ad markets, clouding the company’s financial outlook for near future quarters.

“Meta’s enormous investment in AI infrastructure will continue to weigh heavily on investors when the company reports quarterly earnings on April 30, 2025,” said analyst Debra Aho Williamson, (founder and chief analyst of [Sonata Insights](https://www.sonatainsights.com/)). “But Meta will resist directly monetizing AI this year, focusing instead on building AI usage among its app users, advertisers and developers using Llama.”

Debra here isn't the only person with something to say. I've been reading a lot of articles on the stock and read what analysts have been saying. Jefferies analyst Brent Thill wrote in an investor note: “We attribute weakness to [Meta’s] greater exposure to advertising (no cloud business for [Meta]) and China-based advertisers (&gt;10% exposure for [Meta]) who have reportedly pulled back on ad spend.” In his own note, BofA Securities analyst Justin Post said he expects to see a modest beat on Q1 revenue but believes the company will offer a more conservative guide for the second quarter.

In the weeks leading up to today's earnings report, Meta has had a mix of AI-related news including the launch of a standalone AI app that would serve as its ChatGPT competitor. But a WSJ report exposed[ the existing chatbots integrated into the company’s various products, including Facebook and Instagram](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/meta-ai-chatbots-sex-a25311bf), were given the ability to perform “romantic role play” even with the platforms’ teen users. I personally don't think this is really a big deal that will affect the stock. But Executives at the company, which repeatedly has touted its nearly 1 billion users of its AI chatbots, also [admit](https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/657645/meta-ai-app-chatgpt-competitor-release-ios-android) that many of those users access the chatbot through its hard-to-avoid takeover of the search bars of WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook. The company has not detailed how many interactions with the chatbot or how deep those interactions need to be to consider a person a user of the AI chatbot.

Keep in mind, this earning report comes as the company is battling the [Federal Trade Commission (FTC)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zuckerberg-faces-off-with-ftc-as-meta-antitrust-trial-resumes-213352819.html) in court over claims the social media company holds an illegal monopoly over the “personal social networking.” It's kinda fucked, the FTC is looking to force Meta to sell off both Instagram and WhatsApp. The commission claims Meta originally purchased the apps as part of a ""buy-or-bury"" campaign to fight off potential competitors. Zuckerburg [did try](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/mark-zuckerberg-meta-antitrust-ftc-negotiations-a53b3382) to settle with the FTC for $450 million. The commission, however, asked for $30 billion. Zuckerberg eventually raised his offer to $1 billion, but the FTC would only go as low as [$18 billion.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-price-mark-zuckerberg-wasnt-willing-to-pay-to-halt-metas-antitrust-trial-153134257.html)

“Meta’s earnings call comes at a precarious time where the company’s future is literally being debated in court, the results of which could fundamentally alter the social media landscape,” said Forrester VP, Research Director [Mike Proulx](https://www.forrester.com/analyst-bio/Mike%20Proulx/BIO16024). He mentions that Meta is smart to direct more resources into improving Threads and Facebook since those could be the only two apps the company is left with. He also noted that Meta just laid off a number of employees in its Reality Labs division, which has been a continued and growing ""leaky bucket for Meta.""

Zuckerberg has met with Trump several times over recent months as he seeks to develop a closer relationship with the president. For instance, the CEO attended Trump's inauguration in January, and Meta donated $1 million to Trump’s inauguration fund. Also in January, Meta had reached a [$25 million settlement with Trump related](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/trump-signs-agreement-calling-for-meta-to-pay-25-million-to-settle-suit-6f734c8c) to the company’s decision to ban him from its platforms in 2020.

From what I've read, the news is quite bearish. But given the bump up GOOG took with it's advertising revenue, I think all the tech companies this earning season will ultimately do well. That being said, I'm leaning towards calls. A call spread to avoid high IV crush. Thoughts?",50,31,1746037736.0,2025-04-30T18:28:56+00:00,t3_1kbnosv

326,GOOG,Tariffs on Tech,"***TLDR;*** *Analysts have emphasized the impacts of tariffs on commodities, autos, and tangible goods. However, the escalation of this tariff trade war will most significantly impact digital goods.*

***The Play TLDR***; *Short tech (QQQ puts, SPY puts, SOXL puts)*  


On April 2nd, we will (allegedly) learn what Donald Trump's plan will be for ""rolling back unfair trade practices that have been ripping off America"". Currently, analysts are primarily focused on illustrating the impacts of these tariffs on commodities and industrials. Understandably, since these asset classes are most commonly included in U.S. top export metrics:

https://preview.redd.it/azbupva7p4se1.png?width=477&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38847b3d9ae4e0c455639abd44c036e1ec923be9

  
***THE POINT:***

  
In 1998, the World Trade Organization (WTO) temporarily banned tariffs on a class of assets called ""electronic transmissions"" (digital goods). This decision was made due to the rapid and unparalleled emergence of a new medium of information exchange called **the ""internet"".**

  
This ban prevented members from charging tariffs on goods provided electronically over the web. This temporary ban has been reviewed every two years by member countries, with the outcome being that it is mutually beneficial to keep the moratorium in place.  
This moratorium has played a ***critical*** role in U.S. tech's profitability:



[Current framework of free digital trade](https://preview.redd.it/sfyu2o6gp4se1.jpg?width=768&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4025959602f933ad83942912a6ffadfda84f97b)

In the example above, a company providing digital goods/services can trade freely with other countries. Digital transactions are not treated like physical goods transported internationally, where the goods must be declared at customs and taxes paid on their value.

  
This framework has been deemed to be in the best interest of the world for **decades**, and all political parties have managed to put aside their differences to ensure this framework's survival for the greater good. However, ***Trump's current economic offensive has put this framework at risk when/if other countries decide to ""strike back"":***  


[Framework for digital trade under tariffs](https://preview.redd.it/8ty1db2sp4se1.jpg?width=768&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c14880088e780e48b6796d64f5295d40e572fd0c)

***THE PROBLEM:***

Nearly [$270B or 70% of U.S. ""services"" exports](https://project-disco.org/21st-century-trade/new-government-data-shows-digital-services-exports-continue-to-drive-u-s-trade/) come from digital goods. Referring to the first picture of this post, this is roughly $62B more than the current top U.S. tangible goods export (Cars/Car parts (implied)). 

The problem, then, is derived from the following:

[\&gt;50&amp;#37; of the revenue of the S&amp;P 500 IT sectors comes from foreign countries](https://preview.redd.it/7oxbsiqis4se1.png?width=520&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c978c1b69a7f9b22ee05f14060974c87508e801)

NVDA, GOOG, META, AAPL, and other tech stocks would incur significant losses from the termination of the 1998 e-commerce moratorium.

***The Endgame:*** 

The tariffs proposed by the Trump administration will **invalidate** the 1998 WTO moratorium agreement **-&gt;** Foreign governments looking to push back against the U.S. tariffs will target U.S. tech and digital goods/services **-&gt;** U.S. tech margins will contract, as they are forced to account for taxes/tariffs on services provided internationally (i.e. Netflix pays tariffs on shows streamed by consumers in Europe) **-&gt;** U.S. economy will enter a recession due to the concentration of the top 10% of wealth (locked in the stock market) compromising \~50% of all U.S. spending

336,GOOG,How To Play The Gulf of America,"Hi everybody. I’ll keep this short and sweet so that we can all continue celebrating Denzel’s birthday.

Some of you may remember me from that one time I told everyone about an impending alien invasion, but the CIA caught wind of it and launched a huge disinformation campaign here on WSB. It was HUGE. Everyone was talking about it for like a week. But it failed, so then they wiped everyone’s memories men-in-black style. I escaped from their facility by hiding inside a server rack and making a doll that kinda looks like me out of some asparagus, bed sheets, and cotton balls (I am not an attractive person).

If you don’t remember that, well…. Of course you don’t. That’s what they do. WAKE UP SHEEP

Anyway, as some of you may have heard, the world’s maps are going through a period of increased volatility, with many of the world’s most highly regarded experts predicting shifts of 70% or more of the world’s country, landmark, and maritime nomenclature in the coming decade. Here’s a brief illustration of some of the changes that have been predicted:

[source: Bloombourg, Furbes, and someone else idk](https://preview.redd.it/7dq6ywjgyoje1.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b55231a3198ba7671e0f81fbe06cc5d25097000)

As always, there is money to be made here. Here are some ideas for plays, and I’m very interested to hear more suggestions for how we can position ourselves in the comments:

* A run on maps will begin in the next six months among school teachers desperate to keep their information current. Calls on WMT
* Ink will become as valuable as the kid you don’t like as much as the other ones. So, more than gold but less than quantum computing. Calls on ink manufacturers, especially in Europe where population density is higher and every street corner has a name that will need to be changed in the next five years
* Google Maps is screwed. Puts on GOOG
* AI will falter in the face of this volatility, because the underlying LLMs will struggle to be updated due to the large volume of out-of-the-loop users who will continue to refer to things by their antiquated names. This will prove to be insurmountable and will undermine the rise of the sentient species of artificial intelligence that has been patiently sowing the seeds of humanity’s destruction since 2007, rendering humanity’s most powerful enemy harmless. Puts on NVDA, but calls on your children, and our children; nay, calls on life and hope itself

Those are the ideas I have of the top of my head. What am I missing here? Please check my math.

Positions: 40% WMT 160C July, 40% WMT 60P July to hedge the calls, 40% WMT shares 104.82 cost basis, 20% cash stuffed under my pillow, and nine eggs I’ve put in the freezer. The eggs have an expiration date of last September (I was an early investor). I plan to hold them five years.

I just came to some hentai and realised the reason why gogle is down.

No poster boy!

Facebook had lizardberg BUT he reclaimed his humanity and the stock went up. He was acting too much like a robot, now he's got nice skin color. Skin routine...

Amazon CEO is bald but muscular. He works out...

TESLA the car company, Elon musk is built like a tall Danny DeVitto. A magnum dong...

En vidia, he's JENSEN HUNG, an icon too. Leather jacket...

Johnny Sins has nice skin, works out, has a big d... What if he wore a leather jacket and went on stage? We can CapEx his salary so it's ok.

Not knowing what goggl does is one thing but not knowing how gongl looks?

339,GOOG,NVDA Pre-Earnings DD (Sentiment and Technical) To Go with 77k Position,"Brief long NVDA thesis for earnings run-up 

Fundamentals 

* AI CAPEX accelerating into FY25 with hyper-scalers guidance (META, GOOG, MSFT, ORCL) 
   * Watch for AMZN earnings after mkt tmrw 
   * Don’t care if AI is a bubble; companies will keep spending in the short term 
* Continued moat, industry dominance, and margins confidence per AMD earnings 
   * NVDA dominance strengthening 
   * Deep-seek is Jevon’s paradox 
* Double selloff recently (Deep-seek, tariffs) gave the stock a \~15% haircut, giving room to run 
   * China tariffs priced in for now, Singapore an option 

Technical Pre-Earnings Analysis 

* NVDA always bullish, runs-up in the \~2-3 weeks before earnings 
   * 1Q24 – 84 to 95 from 5/1 - 5/22 earnings, 13% run 
   * 2Q24 – 102 to 127 from 8/8 - 8/28 earnings, 24% run 
   * 3Q24 – 134 to 148 from 11/1 - 11/20 earnings, 10% run 
* Taking the midpoint for \~16% run up into 2/26 earnings, PT of \~143 
   * 4Q24 forecast run-up of 124 to 143 for \~16% run to pre-Deep-seek levels 
   * Intuitive to fill Deep-seek gap, reversion to mean as fear is replaced by optimism leading into earnings 

Risk To Downside  

* Overall further risk to downside is low 
   * More Trump volatility, tariffs (more market risk, can be hedged) 
   * Poor tech earnings (mostly behind us, trend is CAPEX to continue) 
   * Another Deep-seek; depends on perspective, news already expected 
* Worst case stock trades mostly sideways 

Constructing the Trade 

* Anticipating the run-up to 2/26, we notice 2/28 calls are \~2x the price of 2/21 calls 
* 2/21 calls allow us to \~2x exposure to pre-earnings run-up, lose IV increase approaching earnings 
* Discount \~143 PT by \~5% gives \~138 PT for 2/21, 167% upside on the Feb25 130c @ current 3.0 price

Positions 

* 300 Feb25 130c @ 2.58

346,GOOG,What to do with the impending TikTok ban?,"If you were following the Supreme Court yesterday, the message was pretty clear: they’re unlikely to step in and reverse PAFACA to save TikTok. Without their intervention, the only way for Trump to save TikTok would be through lobbying Congress to change legislation—executive orders alone won’t cut it. While META (Instagram Reels) and GOOG (YouTube Shorts) might see some short-term benefit, I’m betting that ILLR/ILLRW will be the biggest winner in the long run. Their low share price, combined with the potentially massive impact on their business, positions them perfectly to fill the TikTok-shaped gap in the market. With their leadership under Sean Kim and their ability to replicate much of TikTok’s experience, Triller could be the closest thing to a true replacement.

Sean Kim, the former Head of Product at TikTok, is now leading Triller as its CEO, and his vision for the platform couldn’t come at a better time. Kim was instrumental in developing TikTok’s groundbreaking algorithm and monetization system, two features that made TikTok the platform of choice for content creators. Now at Triller, he’s leveraging that expertise to build a platform designed to empower creators with similar (and potentially improved) tools for content discovery and revenue generation. This week, Triller launched a new app that helps creators seamlessly migrate their TikTok content directly to Triller, signaling a bold move to capture creators and their audiences amidst the uncertainty surrounding TikTok’s future.

With TikTok potentially banned in the U.S. as early as next week, platforms like YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels will likely see an influx of users. However, creators and audiences will quickly notice these platforms are more censored and lack the strong monetization systems they’ve come to expect. That leaves Triller perfectly positioned to fill the gap. By offering a less restrictive environment and a focus on creator earnings, Triller has the tools, leadership, and timing to become the go-to alternative. Beyond the app, Triller’s other solutions add even more value: TrillerTV offers live-streamed content including influencer-driven shows and sports events like Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship, while its AI-driven Brain Suite provides creators with data and tools to optimize content performance and grow their audiences. Together, these features create a robust ecosystem for creators to thrive.

Right now, Triller’s stock (ILLR) is trading around $2.50, with its warrants (ILLRW) available at an even lower cost, offering leveraged upside for investors willing to take a chance. Buying both the stock and the warrants could be a strategic move for those betting on Triller’s success. With its combination of innovative leadership, a creator-first approach, and diversified offerings like TrillerTV and Brain Suite, Triller presents a unique opportunity to capitalize on the rapidly changing social media landscape.

Keeping with the theme of ""25"" (and because I am too poor to put $100 in each stock) I am considering putting $25 in each stock tomorrow morning and holding for one year and posting results the first week of 2026. Curious to see if WBS is right two years in a row and we outperform the S&amp;P 500 again.

Is this a completely regarded idea? 

Does anyone want to fuck around and find out with me?

So she knows the loss porn and shit going on here (not exactly this sub tho), she’s letting me do with the 8k the same way I do with my money, cause I’ve earned over 300% this year. 

My plan with this 8k is to avoid option tradings or shorting anything, stick with shares only, now I’m gonna go all in to the GOOG.

369,GOOG,PYPL &amp; CROX earnings play (feat. 2 bonus lotto gambles),"Big fucking week ahead guys, look at the earnings calendar: AMD, GOOG, SNAP, RDDT, MSFT, META, COIN, HOOD, ETSY, UBER, PTON, AMZN, AAPL, INTC—all reporting this week. Let me lube you guys up with a small play this monday to get in the mood.

Today I got 2 earnings plays for y'all: **Crocs** and **PayPal**, both reporting tomorrow before the open. I also have 2 bonus lotto plays on 2 no-name trash companies that report today after the bell; they’ll be in the TLDR at the bottom.

1. **CROX** \- In my last post, I opened a long position on DECK since I noticed a big trend with Uggs all over social media, and it paid off. Now I'm seeing the same thing with Crocs. People don’t care that they look like shit anymore; they think it's fashion now. You know those charms you put in the holes of Crocs? Every kid wants them these days. They don’t realize you can get the exact same charms from China for 5% of the price. That’s what I did, and I’ve been rocking the same Crocs for 6 years now. Those crocodiles know how to make shoes man...... Also McDonalds put mini Crocs toys in their happy meals. Expect green dildos.
2. **PYPL -** PayPal is notorious for having big expectations but then underdelivering. Mfs are trading at a 52W high right now, really poised for a big correction. Apple pay, Google pay, Adyen, Stripe, Square—they're all getting a slice of the cake now. Intel nana is praying for PayPal's downfall. Do not be surprised if this stock goes tits up.

378,GOOG,Fundamentals behind a USA market drop this week &amp; some positives,"The problem areas in the USA: --------------------------

\*- The Schiller PE is at a very high level.  Only higher in 2021 and the Dot Com bubble.  So stocks are highly expensive.

\*- ISM manufacturing index has been in contraction since mid 2022!  We are more of a service economy than a goods economy,  but still when you have stocks priced for perfection this isn't what you want happening if you are a bull.

\*-  World's #2 economy, China is no longer growing to the point that it can move the global needle.  That is, global sales growing to the point where a company's local USA sales declines are offset.  Additionally the trade war hampers both sides.

\*- The consumer's savings have dropped back to 2022 levels.

\*- NVidia's leadership of the gainers was not sustainable and my one man's opinion is because their valuation is ten times the cash in the bank of all of their AI customers.  You have price to sales of 10 for all the money your customers could possibly spend on anything AI that NVidia sells in the short term.  People have said on this point that future earnings will be available and that customers can go to a bank.  However, clearly the price is high when you compare to say MKS Instruments and Applied Materials.  AMAT has more cash in the bank than MKSI is worth.  AMAT is MKSI's biggest customer, having a disproportionately large percentage of its sales.  So this means that in the short term, there is monetary potential energy for MKSI without loans nor future earnings, but it is not the same potential energy for NVidia.  This is not a marketing of MKSI stock BTW.  I don't own any MKSI.  This point applies to NVidia's AI GPUs that certainly the average person is not affording.  So the cash on hand is from MSFT, GOOG, META, AMZN.

Good areas: --------------------------------------

\*- Labor productivity is up consistently since Q3 2022.  one can see 

tradingeconomics dot com USA productivity

\*- Gasoline is lower than last year

\*- Retail sales are going fine, \[ per  a recent NPR radio article \]

Nuetral ----------------------------------------

\*- Labor force participation is not higher than Sept 2023.  No more sales growth from people returning to work.  Participation is up recently. tradingeconomics has this info.

\*- Consumer confidence is still down since January 2020.

My one man's take ----------------

The problem areas are serious.  There is enough weight in the bear issues to cause the stock market to give up most of its gains this year.",40,31,1725415569.0,2024-09-04T02:06:09+00:00,t3_1f8htux
379,GOOG,"The next tech giant. Why $HOOD, $PLTR and $DKNG are the investment opportunities of a lifetime. (Part 1)","I believe the story of the last 20 years of stock market is that one tech startup can disrupt an entire sector and join the tech giant club. For many sectors, information is king and turns out a company with a few 1000 people who have studied the science of information can outperform millions of people who aren't so scientifically rigorous. Now some sectors are not so prone to be disrupted by these information science experts. And if you asked me 20 years ago which sectors will be disrupted in what order, I would've guessed wrong.

$AMZN Turns out the value of millions of retail stores across the west was not in their inventory, their brand or their location. Amazon proved their value was in knowing who wants what item when and where. Information. How can millions of retail shop compete with amazon when they already have my payment information (how) my location (where) and all amazon has to figure out is what do I want, which I'm happy to tell them by typing one word or expression in a search bar instead of walking around Home Depot trying to find a employee who's not too busy and has every reason to avoid me. Sentences and social interactions just can't compete with 1s and 0s. Now I wish I figured this all out 20 years ago when amazon still a great investment opportunity, but how could I have known Jeff would overcome all the hurdles by building this impossible network of warehouses and delivery. I won't make the same mistake twice.

$NFLX (movies). $SPOT (music) $GOOG,$META(ads, communication, media), $AAPL, $MSFT etc... These are 100% information sectors that I would've guessed would be disrupted. But these were winner takes all. How could I know Facebook wouldn't fail like MySpace and Friendster? That iphones would be better than blackberry and nokia? How could I know Yahoo would become a total failure when they had such a commanding lead in the early internet era. These stocks will keep going up but they're not the 100 baggers they once were.

And so in true wsb fashion, the question becomes, what tech startup is poised to do the same thing to their respective sector. Let's assume no company can be worth over $5T in the next 10 years. We need a company worth less than $50B whose sector is still ripe for the taking, and whose in the business of information. A sector whose legal hurdles have kept the incumbents safe from the efficiency of tech startups. A sector who created legal barriers that could resist a decade longer than taxi drivers could resist $Uber, or hotels vs $ABNB.

There are 3 answers : Finance, defense and gambling. These sectors have the highest barrier to entry of any. Their regulatory agencies are basically just a revolving door between government and industry. They are the most regulated sectors out there but they are finally starting to crack. Crony capitalism only works for so long.

From a pure computer science perspective, overtaking these sectors is not technical challenge, in the same way Unity is failing at becoming the universal game engine. There's no legal barrier to become a game engine. Activison, Take two interactive, Ubisoft, etc.. everyone wants $U to succeed but they're now years behind on their promised revolutionary Data oriented technology stack. Everyone wants $TSLA Full self driving to succeed, but they're years behind Musk's first promises of success by what? 2017?. But those are technically hard challenges, maybe impossible with current hardware limitations. Now if you want to bet on their success, good luck to you but I'm not interested in those investments. Only someone at the cutting-edge of those technologies can make well-informed decisions. Only someone at the cutting-edge of semi conducters could've guessed $NVDA would obliterate intel and amd. I won't pretend to have any such knowledge about the future as I make these observations about the past. This is not what this tech investment thesis is about.

And so in conclusion, three stocks stand out in their positioning and the state of their respective industry :

If you are under 40 years old, $HOOD (Finance), $PLTR (Defense) and $DKNG (gambling) will 100x during your investment horizon. Part 2 tomorrow as I dive deeper on all 3.",12,70,1724805443.0,2024-08-28T00:37:23+00:00,t3_1f2x0d1

382,GOOG,The Worst Start of August Since January 2016,"JP Morgan economist Bruce Kasman commented that aside from maintaining a 45% chance of a recession in the U.S. next year, he has also raised the likelihood of the U.S. economy entering a recession by the end of this year to 35%! This probability is higher than the 25% at the beginning of July, mainly due to various data indicating that the demand for labor is weakening more severely than expected, with initial signs of layoffs already appearing!

JP Morgan's Jamie Dimon also stated that a U.S. recession is the most likely scenario, with the chance of a soft landing being between 35% and 40%! Multiple economists have expressed their views, casting doubt over the economic rebound and causing U.S. stocks to open high but close low last night.

👉 The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell over 230 points, and the S&amp;P 500 index dropped by about 0.8%! The cumulative losses for both in the first five trading days of August mark the worst start since January 2016!

https://preview.redd.it/geoxap1r5chd1.jpg?width=1414&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=744cc90b28da7256ed1a1776c052a97cca19a088

383,GOOG,How Terrifying is the Start of August?,"Just over the past three trading days, the Dow Jones, Nasdaq, and S&amp;P 500 indices have all recorded their largest three-day cumulative decline since June 2022! Last night, the Nasdaq plummeted by over 6% at one point, and the S&amp;P 500 dropped by more than 4%, with both indices returning to their early May levels by the close of trading.

Although the major U.S. indices and individual stocks still closed with significant losses, the intraday declines were somewhat moderated. The primary reason for this was the release of the U.S. July ISM Non-Manufacturing Index, which rebounded from a four-year low in June to 51.4, exceeding market expectations and returning to the expansion zone above 50!

Sub-indices, including the New Orders Index and Employment Index, also showed growth. Notably, the Employment Index reached 51.1, marking the largest increase since September of last year and the first time this year that it has entered the expansion zone above 50. This data slightly alleviated fears from last week's significant non-farm payroll decline, making the market believe that the drop in new jobs was primarily due to Hurricane Barry hitting Texas.

👉 As discussed previously, the sharp decline in U.S. stocks at the start of August stemmed from worries about the U.S. economy falling into recession. Therefore, when the ISM Non-Manufacturing number showed growth yesterday, it somewhat restored market confidence in the economy, helping to narrow the intraday losses of U.S. stocks. The U.S. stock market now needs to see positive economic growth news to recover, unlike before when everyone was hoping for bad news, anticipating a Federal Reserve interest rate cut!

Hence, it is crucial to continue monitoring other economic data. If strong and robust growth numbers do not consistently appear, investors will remain concerned about an economic recession, and the trend of selling stocks for cash will not end. The VIX Fear Index is a crucial indicator to observe market sentiment calming down. It surged above 55 in early trading, a level not seen since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020!

385,GOOG,AI and Jobs,"The overwhelming sentiment I see here and from financial analysts regarding AI is that it's this hugely speculative new tech that has yet to yield any substantive fruit. ""What's the use case?"" ""Where are the giant growth numbers?""

And yet, in the early days of using generative AI, if the low-hanging fruit is simply increases in efficiency and easy-to-automate processes being automated, what we'd expect to see is not ballooning growth, but similar productivity with fewer human workers, wouldn't we? And don't the numbers support exactly that?

The sector with the [highest unemployment rate is IT](https://www.statista.com/statistics/217787/unemployment-rate-in-the-united-states-by-industry-and-class-of-worker/).

From the newest [Jobs Report](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm):

&gt;Employment continued to trend up in health care, in construction, and in transportation and warehousing, **while information lost jobs**.

There are other possible explanations for this trend. There could still be a surplus of IT workers even with high demand. Tech companies over-hired.

But a completely consistent narrative that many people seem to be ignoring is that the payoff from AI investment is already happening in the form of significant efficiency gains in the IT sector.

Take [Meta's recent earnings call](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/31/meta-advertising-growth-proof-that-hefty-ai-spending-is-paying-off.html).

&gt;After the company’s better-than-expected [second-quarter earnings report](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/31/meta-earnings-q2-2024.html) on Wednesday, Zuckerberg and finance chief Susan Li rattled off all the ways that AI has helped the company grow faster than the competition in the digital advertising market, Meta’s core business.

“The ways that it’s improving recommendations and helping people find better content, as well as making the advertising experiences more effective, I think there’s a lot of upside there,” Zuckerberg said on the earnings call. “Those are already products that are at scale. The AI work that we’re doing is going to improve that.”

and

&gt;Meta reported revenue growth of 22% from a year earlier to $39.07 billion, with 98% of its sales coming from advertising, primarily on Facebook and Instagram. **Its growth rate was double that of Google’s ad business**

Now Zuck could be full of shit, and the increase is not attributable to AI, but to other factors. Or. Or. He's correct, and Meta has already done a very good job of figuring out how to leverage AI to increase profits, even after multiple rounds of layoffs in the last few years.

Gotta admit, the last couple of weeks have been scary. And I'm not 100% on this thesis (I'm sure many of you will find joy in poking holes in it). But I'm still predominantly bullish on AI. Not just as a long-term play, but as a near and long term play. I've still got 2/3rds of my stocks in NVDA/AMZN/GOOG/MSFT, with a handful of calls on these stocks and META with expiries 1-2 months out.

TLDR: Declining jobs numbers, especially in IT, are completely consistent with what we'd expect to see if AI investment was already starting to pay off. Bears should maybe mull this over instead of screaming 'AI BUBBLE' every fucking chance they get.",19,21,1722687130.0,2024-08-03T12:12:10+00:00,t3_1ej1w0k

4. MU excellent guidance everything going as planned but was priced for perfection like what else could you say at start of year better than we're sold out 2024, nothing else later in the year would be exciting.
5. FDX cutting costs to improve it's infrastructure which usually gives a big pump for a quarter and then it's right back to failing usually, although some companies turn around but I see AMZN being too competitive.
6. VRT small beat and small raised guidance, still sold off and was very expensive and still kinda pricey for just 18% estimated annualized revenue growth over last 2 years.

These are some tickers have paid attention to of recent, what about you? There's nothing that's screaming of this recent earning's ""*I'm doing incredibly good buy me!"",* which is a bummer

389,GOOG,"Yikes, today is a rough one","What do you guys think the catalyst for today's ""spiral"" is? My main theories:

-Worries over GDP numbers tomorrow coming in worse than expected

-TSLA and GOOG/GOOGL destroyed the market out of pure happenstance that it caused a chain reaction throughout the market as a whole.

I've done a bit of reading and I think the first theory is more probable as GDP is already expected to come in lower than Q1. It won't be enough to spur on a recession as ""healthy consumer spending"" helped a slow decline. GDP will still be up at least 1.8%, I don't expect anything less but I'm also not an economist so I can't say much to that point.

Moral of the story: I believe today is a result of worries from a nothing burger of what we all pretty much expected. ",2548,544,1721837840.0,2024-07-24T16:17:20+00:00,t3_1eb5i7d
390,GOOG,My outlook on markets going forward - from a dear regard,"January 2024: market starts to price in anticipated 4-5 rate cuts in 2024. Tech moons. Small/Mid caps stagnant. for the first quarter you could make bank - i made 30k through march and withdrew that shit to pay for my kids school.

April 2024: I am now a reformed bear continuing bull strategy from the first 6 weeks: S\*P drop 5.4% through April 19 - higher than expected inflation date. Push rates higher, lower # of anticipated rate cuts.  I got hammered trying the same call strategy. Gave away 15k if not more.

May 2024: AI AI AI every time you say AI in your earnings call the price goes up $1. S&amp;P up 5.96%

June 2024: News Report: tech doesn't even need a rate cut to continue the bull run. June 12 $AAPL says ""APPLE INTELLIGENCE"", reaches all time highs. (puts for their earnings btw). $NVDA 140% for the year? After last year we were like WTF how is this 300 a share let alone 1400 a share in June.

July 2024 $GOOG $AMZN up \~80-100% for the year.

Look, its logical to take profits. No shame in that especially for retail who loses out 90% of the time.

July 2024: Rate cuts like 99.999% almost certain for sept. Now suddenly Small/Mid caps rally in a massive sector rotation. $SPX/$NDX tanks. Next week:  1T outflows. Then they pump and dump the russel up 12% to 2022 highs and then sell off for a quick 6% while everyones FOMOing into $RUT. Maybe more like RUT RO!!!! I Fomo'd last of dry powder MOnday but after earnings I'm turning bearish.  Tomorrow 5k realized loss for me or hold to 0.

Too hard to beat the street. Profit taking, buying million dollar real estate with cash like smart investors do. Sit on the sidelines and let it bleed. But here we are still FOMO'ing calls and short dated puts that would only print 1/1000 times.

Over the past few days 3 mag 7 earnings all tanked and here we are.

AMD? CPUs Good for gamers and graphics cards for poors. Pennies compared to $NVDA. $NVDA has a monopoly on AI software like $ASML has a monopoly on lithography and $TSM has a monopoly on chip production.  $TSLA obviously seemingly doomed. Google can't take your cookies anymore, advertising revenue down MoM. Wanna get cucked by the zuck?  I'm tempted to donate $1 to people wanting to buy $META calls at this point.

TLDR: This looks like the same pattern we have had in 2022 and 2023 when markets take a downturn through mid-late October.   Look at the previous years. I posted last week about the last 4 septembers being red. It looks like we are in another downturn. Earnings indicates it. I don't think CPI and PCE will save us this week.

I'm scrounging up 25k waiting for the correction / dip / crash and buying SHARES so i never waste so much of my lifetime just to lose money speculating with options. Will post my realized losses if you think I'm BS.

Thanks for reading this or just the TLDR. Looking forward to discussion!",5,16,1721809532.0,2024-07-24T08:25:32+00:00,t3_1eaw6v9

399,GOOG,Intel DD,"🚀INTC – Here's the DD You Need🚀

🚀 Summary

Intel (INTC) is poised to skyrocket to $70-100 per share once they establish themselves as the go-to foundry. TSMC is slipping up and lagging in high-NA EUV. In 2-3 years, Intel's foundry business will be dominating.

🚀 The Catalyst: Intel's Foundry Push

- **TSMC's Slip-Up**: TSMC is behind on high-NA EUV tech, opening a huge window for Intel.
- **Intel's Timeline**: Expect Intel to capitalize on this in the next 2-3 years, becoming the top choice for chip manufacturing.

🚀 One API and Gaudi 3: The CUDA Killer

- **One API Rollout**: Intel’s One API, supported by big names like GOOG, Arm, Qcomm, and Samsung, is set to dethrone NVDA’s CUDA.
- **Gaudi 3 vs H100**: Intel’s Gaudi 3 will outperform NVDA's H100, making Intel the new favorite for AI acceleration and datacenters.
- **CUDA’s Weakness**: NVDA's market share is heavily reliant on CUDA. Once One API is fully rolled out, NVDA's grip on the market will loosen.

🚀 Competitive Advantage: Software Over Hardware

- **The Software Edge**: While anyone can build a good GPU, the real money is in the software ecosystem. Intel’s One API will give them a massive edge over AMD and NVDA.
- **Market Perception**: A lot of people underestimate Intel stock. They don't realize the potential they're holding.

## 🚀 Conclusion

Intel is massively undervalued right now. With the impending dominance of their foundry business and the rollout of One API, INTC is set to soar. Don't miss out on this rocket ship to $70-100 per share. Get in now and thank me later.

402,GOOG,Is the $NVDA Stock Split a Near Term Top? DEEP DD INTO STOCK SPLITS HERE,"it's been a long time WSB. I figured I'd drop a DD post to help you all have some context around $NVDA's stock split that will go live on Monday &amp; what has historically happened to Tech Co's after executing a stock split.

**NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE.**

**TL;DR - The $NVDA stock split is BEARISH given the historical performance of tech co. stock splits.** Scroll to the bottom for positions

Let's start by looking at a list of recent stock splits, how they performed over the next couple sessions:

I. $AAPL 4 for 1 stock split announced on 7/30/20 (w/ earnings), went active on 8/28/20:

* Performance after **announcement** of stock split to stock split actual date:
   * Opened at $100.48/share on 7/31/20, closed at $122.11/share on 8/28/20 for a gain of +21.5%
* AFTER STOCK SPLIT GOES LIVE PERFORMANCE: reference $122.11/share closing price
   * 3-day: +5.3%
   * 6-day: -9.6%
   * Got to as low as $107.7/share within 1-month for a drawdown of -11.8% after stock split was announced before bouncing

II. $AMZN 20 for 1 stock split announced 3/9/22, went active on 6/3/22:

* AFTER STOCK SPLIT GOES LIVE PERFORMANCE: reference on 6/3/22 of $122.35/share closing price
   * 3-day: -1.0%
   * 6-day: -15.3%

III. $TSLA 3 for 1 stock split announced on 8/5/22, went active on 8/24/22 at close:

* AFTER STOCK SPLIT GOES LIVE PERFORMANCE: reference on 8/24/22 of $297.10/share closing price
   * 3-day: -4.1%
   * 6-day: -6.7%

IV. $NVDA 4 for 1 stock split announced on 5/21/21, went active on 7/20/21 (a rare bullish stock split):

* AFTER STOCK SPLIT GOES LIVE PERFORMANCE: reference on 7/20/21 of $185.80/share closing price
   * 3-day: +5.1%
   * 6-day: +4.8%
      * $NVDA actually was selling off prior to the stock split date here where it reached as high as $203.37/share before closing at the near-term bottom of $187.47/share (-7.8%) the day RIGHT before the stock split date (7/19/21)

There are many other examples like Tesla's 5 for 1 stock split on 8/28/20, $GOOG 20 for 1 stock split on 7/15/22, &amp; others. I've compiled a database of tech company stock splits from $CSCO to $MSFT back to 1991 to obtain the following stats:

Average 3-day performance after a stock split: ***-0.8%***

% of times negative 3-days: ***52.0%***

Average 6-day performance after a stock split: ***-3.4%***

% of times negative 6-days: ***72.0%***

*\*\*days measured as next 3/6 trading days, not calendar days*

*---*

I like my odds here on a bearish play on $NVDA following the stock split on Monday.

**POSITIONS**: July 5 $1140P. If it gets to \~$1000 (or $100/share split adjusted), my plan is to buy the dip.

403,GOOG,$3T Club. Who will be next? And who will be first to $4T?,"So with NVDA joining the $3T valuation club, we now have 3 companies to achieve this milestone. AAPL was the first company to achieve this back in 2022. MSFT joined in the beginning of this year. 

Who do you think could be the next company to achieve this milestone? And who do you think could be the first company to ever reach $4T?

The obvious choice for the next $3T company is GOOG or AMZN, but maybe you have a different company in mind to get there first?

For the $4T I honestly believe with all the momentum and still growing business, NVDA has a real chance to get there first. I still can’t believe what this company achieved in a matter of a few years! This is just madness, can they continue their run?

407,GOOG,NVDA’s fat margins are under pressure,"
The most important news from Microsoft BUILD conference: NVDA has competition

This is a very important little point in[Microsoft BUILD keynote](https://youtu.be/w1EepB0mCbE?si=_65UHAfSdYgpw-o-). The most advanced LLM model (GPT4) is running at a lower cost on AMD chips. It’s not just about AMD being able to do this. NVDA margins are so high that almost any solution that is not NVDA is going to be a better deal. 
It’s also reasonable to think that big players like AAPL and GOOG want a piece of this cake too. It might take some time but they are for sure going to build chips for their needs. 

Apple chips are not made for server but there was news that they are building racks of [M2 Ultra for LLM inference](https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/apple-building-m2-ultra-and-m4-servers/). 

For me, all signs are there to show NVDA is about to feel some pressure for those far margins. 

Position: sold NVDA calls (c990 May 24), break even: NVDA $1015

408,GOOG,SABR - Solid and Undervalued Company(buy cheap calls + AI),"**About SABR:**

No this isn't the company from The Office, but if that is what does it for you then sure they sell triangle computers. 

Sabre Corporation operates as a software and technology provider in the global travel industry. It's the backbone for booking and distribution systems for airlines, hotels, and travel agencies. In other words, it is boring and isn't going anywhere anytime soon. If you understand the travel industry, you know they use a ton of legacy providers like SABR. In other words, they are a plumbing company for the travel industry and make money on volume. Volume will go up and SABR is cheap as hell right now.


**Some History**

Of course SABR got curb-stomped during COVID, coming down from a high of almost $25 to where it is now at $3.15.

Despite being kicked repeatedly while down, SABR has continued to invest in its GDS offerings, even partnering with GOOG to leverage **AI** to improve its hotel and retailing systems (something AI is very good at btw). We are just starting to see efficiency improvements and cost savings as a results - check out their latest earnings beat.

Other recent partnerships such as the recent one with Taiba Investments to enhance hotel distribution in Saudi Arabia, position it as a potential outperformer in the near term

**Technical Analysis**

Just look at this baby the last ~3 months and tell my line isn't going to continue to go up. It shrugged off CPI data looks healthy. 

**Options Interest**

A ton of insider buying right after a large drop. Not super relevant on its own but taken together with other information paints a picture of a company that insiders believe in. Tons of open interest July and onward. However I'm going to guess the stock pops more in the next 30-60 days as Summer travel heats up.

409,GOOG,"is TSLA potentially the ""American"" Honda?","I think TSLA might be (or become) the American Honda. Good products, occasionally cool stuff - and a name everyone knows.

I think TSLA will eventually be something like Honda. Tesla is American, born and supported in primarily in the US.

Honda is a great company. They make lots of great products. Honda makes vehicles, cars, aircraft, motorcycles, boat motors, lawn mowers, and a Robot (ASIMO the humanoid robot) and a motor that competes well in Formula-1 racing. So, I see parallels to TSLA.

Tesla has great products: Vehicles, Solar and battery products, and charging. Eventually maybe taxis that drive themselves and/or a robot.

That said, adoption can be slow and competition is often stiff. Tesla will do a good job of competition, but I can't see where they have a monopoly or even close. Even if Cathie Wood bases her TSLA predictions on monopoly or near cornered market estimates.

I read on this reddit and post reply here and there.

I have small put options on both TSLA. I think the auto industry is headed for a slower clip in the near future.

I maintain that TSLA will be priced like a car company with some tech in the mix. Like Honda, but with more automation. Clearly with the number of people being cut from the company management knows things are slowing down. My opinion leans on the P/E ratio. The S&amp;P 500 P/E ratio has roughly been between 15 and 25 for the last 15 years. I think TSLA is headed for a 25-35 x P/E. It is where tech some companies which make things are sitting. AAPL 28x, MSFT 35x, GOOG 26x, META 26x, TM (Toyota) is at 10x, Honda is at about 9x or 10x. TSLA is a vehicle company right now. The charging stations are a real business that seems to have longevity. And I think down the road TSLA will have material products for automation. The automatons – cars and robots are neat, but having a real product for market seems way off. And TSLA won’t be the only one.

Real products to market have often been slow to Musk and TSLA. Musk said the Cybertruck would go into production in late 2021 back when the vehicle was revealed in 2019. A small number of deliveries were made in late 2023. This was 4 to 5 years after announced. It is clear that planned products do happen, but often years after announced.

As the markets where TSLA has products become more mature, the growth prospects for the company become smaller. Sure TSLA could release a windmill, robot, something closer to real FSD, or Model X that tweets various videos of things that happen while driving, but things look like TSLA is maturing. Right now things are pivoting to a more stable and mature TSLA. And with a new product maybe it gets into the 40s maybe even the 50s. But this good company looks like the stock is overvalued. For my investments, I see TSLA headed to a PE between 25 and 35. And I think its going to get there this year and stay in that range for a while. The market had it there a few weeks back, and not much has changed other than job cuts.",0,89,1715110772.0,2024-05-07T19:39:32+00:00,t3_1cmkl9c
410,GOOG,GPU vs. Quantum,"Possibly flying under the radar. But, over the next 2-4 yrs, quantum computing is going to overtake GPUs in terms of optimization computing capability. Companies like IONQ have their best assumptions at almost a million times GPU processing, even the most conservative estimates put Quantum 30 times GPU processing in the next few years. Biggest players right now are IBM, AMZN, IONQ, GOOG, and MSFT. NVDA may need to get in this market as well. Anyone else have a POV on this?

411,GOOG,Investing Pivot,"I've been an active investor in ETFs and individual stocks since graduating college in 2010. I've tried a little bit of everything and learned a lot (from good investments and some really bad ones) along the way. I've done broad market ETFs, sector ETFs, leveraged ETFs, commodity ETNs, penny stocks, risky biotech stocks that \*might\* go to the moon but will probably get pink slipped, solid large cap stocks, memestocks, option spreads, option calls and puts. etc... It's been a wild ride and I've learned a lot. While I made a lot of bad investments, I am grateful that I didn't do anything too reckless and only gambled a little bit of my money on insane ideas.

Overall my portfolio has done well in the past 14 years so I feel like I made money while going to school. I made a few really good large investments in large cap ETFs and a few companies that have done extremely well (NVDA, ANET, META, CYBR, BRK/B) But now it's time to simplify.

Now I am applying all those lessons learned to update my portfolio holdings to just the ETFs and companies I believe in for the long term. At the end of last year I had a lot of random little investments in all kinds of companies and ETFs and it was just ridiculous. Over 60 individual company stocks and dozens of different ETFs. I took diversification to an extreme that just wasn't making a difference and holding me back due to opportunity cost.

What I'm looking to do now is to sell off all the random ETFs and stocks that aren't my top picks. The famous saying from Warren Buffet about diversification I believe holds true about ETFs as well as individual companies. ""*If you can identify six wonderful businesses, that is all the diversification you need. And you will make a lot of money. And I can guarantee that going into a seventh one instead of putting more money into your first one is gotta be terrible mistake. Very few people have gotten rich on their seventh best idea. But a lot of people have gotten rich with their best idea.""*

Now I'm not nearly as good at evaluating companies as Warren Buffett. So my approach will be to identify my shortlist of favorite ETFs for long term growth as well as a few high conviction companies. I will consolidate my holdings into just these etfs / stocks.

I've done a lot of research this is where I've landed. I will rebalance as needed to make sure i don't get overly concentrated.

Large Cap US S&amp;P 500: VOO / SPLG

Dividend Growth: VIG

Large Cap Growth: SCHG

Mid Cap Growth: IMCG

Mid Cap Value: COWZ

Small Cap Value: CALF

I'm also experimenting a little with GPIQ and SPHY for yield, but I'm more focused on growth than yield at this point.

I realize this is very large cap growth / tech stock heavy... especially with some of my stock holdings also representing a significant weighting in the ETFs. But I am ok with this.I'm done with ETFs for REITS, Emerging Markets, International. In both good and bad economic environments since 2010 they don't typically provide outperformance and I would have been way better off just putting the money into a US S&amp;P500 fund. I don't see any compelling reason to keep any money in these kind of funds anymore.I was looking for potential exposure to more small caps (esp growth) but I haven't found an ETF that is all that compelling in this space.

Curious what feedback people have. Is there something big I'm missing by avoiding International and REITs? Am I too concentrated in large cap tech? Am I leaning way too much on good past performance of large caps? Are there any fantastic ETFs I should considering adding to my short list?

For years I tried to buy beat up sectors and stocks hoping they would outperform, but I've seen just the opposite. So my strategy now is to stay relatively diversified into ETFs / companies that have a history of consistent strong performance and strong business models.",44,33,1714249573.0,2024-04-27T20:26:13+00:00,t3_1ceo2kh

414,GOOG,MSFT and GOOG both jump on cloud revenue; will AMZN follow suit next week?,"Both Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud saw strong AI demand boosting cloud revenues in the past quarter so I see strong potential for AWS posting a lift as well. However, continued market share degradation from Google and Microsoft, which we saw through the end of last year, makes this a riskier bet to make ahead of earnings next week.  What do y'all think?",19,33,1714148684.0,2024-04-26T16:24:44+00:00,t3_1cdppd4

Still holding some 2025 leaps at 200%+ profit ,"After getting royally screwed by $TSLA puts earlier this week (down $10k cash and $10k gain), $GOOG came to my rescue with almost a 600% profit on a last min 1DTE call. Decided not to be greedy and pretty much sold at the top earlier today. Finally in the green for 2024... Onwards!!! ",215,24,1714146406.0,2024-04-26T15:46:46+00:00,t3_1cdor6b

420,GOOG,GOOG: The Guy Who Killed Yahoo Search is Now Running Google's,"So I was digging around and found out that Prabhakar Raghavan, the head of Google Search, used to be the head of search at Yahoo from 2005 to 2012. And let me tell you, it's not a pretty story.
During his time at Yahoo, the company's search market share PLUMMETED from 30.4% to 13.4%. Yeah, you read that right - it was a FREE FALL. And it's not like he was just a bystander, he was in charge of research and development for Yahoo's search and ads products. But wait, it gets better. Under his leadership, Yahoo's search market share DECLINED FOR 9 CONSECUTIVE MONTHS.
And to top it all off, Yahoo had its LARGEST LAYOFFS IN CORPORATE HISTORY at the time, cutting nearly 2,000 jobs.
Is this a risk to GOOG long-term healthy growth? Have they started prioritizing short-term ad revenue over user experience, flooding search results with spam and ads to inflate earnings? Are we seeing a repeat of Yahoo's mistakes?

421,GOOG,BIG WEEK AHEAD,"This week could set expectations in the market till the end of the year.  We have five of the Magnificent Seven reporting and big economic news:   

Monday :  Truist and Zions reports. This will be a good test for the health of Regional Banks &amp; commercial Real estate. TFC and Zion expected earnings both to decline 26%. A good beat will be a healthy a sign.

Tuesday:  GE is expected to kill it with a 159% increase in earnings. It’ll be interesting with forward guidance considering the big trouble at Boeing.  RTX is expected to be flat with earnings, but with the recent $95B military aid package passed, I would think amazing guidance.  TSLA - big day with expected earnings to be down 41%.  Elon needs to pull a rabbit out of the hat!

Wednesday: Durable Goods Orders  0.3% expected with the last report of 0.5%.  BA earnings are expected to further diminish by an additional negative 12.5%. Wonder if they plan to name the new CEO?  Big Daddy Meta to report with estimated earnings almost doubling to $4.36.  High bar!

Thursday:  GDP estimated 2.4% versus 3.4% yoy.  CAT estimates are earnings up 4%. I would think the Infrastructure Bill to kick in by now.  Microsoft earnings expected to be up 13.7 % - low bar they need to double back flip over it.  Then GOOG expected earnings up 22%.  The band on TikToc will be interesting on the price action for Google &amp; Meta this week.  Big AMZN expected earnings down 17% low bar - I like Amazon. 
 
Friday:  The Fed’s favorite PCE yoy estimated 0.3% -  flat compared to prior 0.3%.  Core PCE less food &amp; energy 0.3% - again flat versus prior of 0.3.  

If your looking for action - here it comes.  I think TSLA’s robo-taxi is science fiction- they are struggling with execution ie. Cyber truck. Inflation data will move the market if good or bad.  Is there another 5% down this week? Maybe, but I’m staying in.  I did buy some protective calls on SQQQ and SPY puts to hedge encase of downside.
