248,NVDA,Will Qualcomm (QCOM) announce a partnership with OpenAI?,"Couple weeks ago Qualcomm announced AI chips to compete with AMD and Nvidia. The stock pumped 20% to $205. Soon this pump completely tapered off and then some.

Meanwhile, AMD, Broadcom, Oracle, Amazon, Intuit all announced partnerships with OpenAI. Often coincided with their stocks pumping too. 

Could there soon be a partnership between announced between QCOM and an AI lab, even OpenAI? I feel like it is one of the few big semi firms that are left. Are you bullish?",3,2,1764451687.0,2025-11-29T21:28:07+00:00,t3_1pa0bc9,stocks
1,NVDA,Bank of America reaffirms bullish stance on Nvidia as growth projections strengthen,"Nvidia’s outlook has been getting a steady boost as analysts highlight several tailwinds for the company. Beyond the optimism around AI server demand, some brokerages point out that Nvidia could see incremental revenue from adjusted China-compliant chips if U.S. export rules settle into a predictable pattern. There’s also renewed interest in how Nvidia’s partnerships especially with Intel for foundry support might help the company diversify its supply chain. While Nvidia still relies heavily on TSMC, having additional manufacturing pathways is seen as a long-term advantage, particularly with global semiconductor capacity constraints. At the same time, institutions note that demand for data-center GPUs remains structurally strong. Cloud providers and large enterprises continue to scale AI training capacity, and Nvidia’s ecosystem advantage (CUDA, software stack, and developer tools) remains a major barrier for competitors.
Still, some analysts caution that Nvidia’s valuation leaves little room for error. Any slowdown in hyperscaler spending, delays in China revenue, or competitive pressure from Google TPUs or AMD MI chips could introduce volatility. Overall, the sentiment leans positive, but with the usual caveats around competition and macro risks.",72,12,1764423776.0,2025-11-29T13:42:56+00:00,t3_1p9p9s9,StockMarket

249,NVDA,US stocks rise for a fifth straight day to close out a volatile month,"Wall Street rose for a fifth straight day to put the wraps on a volatile month.

The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.5% in abbreviated trading Friday and closed out November with a slim gain of 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 289 points, or 0.6%. The Nasdaq gained 0.7% but ended November with a drop of 1.5% because of losses for some big tech stocks.

Stocks swooned in mid-month as investors worried that stocks boosted by the frenzy around artificial intelligence such as Nvidia had gotten too expensive. Nvidia lost 1.8% Friday and closed the month with a double-digit loss. Oracle fell 23% in November while Palantir Technologies sank 16%.

Is this the end of the AI bubble or is this just the inherent volatility of the niche?

2,NVDA,Semi-analysis report on $GOOGL TpU dominance - Nvida &amp; OpenAi at risk!,"Hey folks- happy Thanksgiving!

Semi-analysis ( leading research lab in semiconductors and Ai) have just published a report on the hot topic.

$GOOGL TpU vs $Nvida GpU. They have done the cost comparison and reporting and some crazy things came out of it!

- Google software revamp to make it easier for companies to onboard chips.

- This becomes a huge threat to Nvida as Cuda system is no longer the only monopoly for Ai chips.

- Pricing for TpU is extremely cheap! At the 9k standard rack size, Google TpU are 2x cheaper then nvida Gpu.

- what does this mean for GPU users? Google tpu will crush with margins. They are so cheap that Google cloud is becoming the go to cloud provider for companies as the pricing is just unbeatable. 

- nvida will most likely see margin compression to 60% in the next year or 2 as they need to start to under price to compete with TpU if Google floods the market.

- OpenAi is in huge trouble. They have billions in commitments and billions in deployed GPU. But the price difference means they will see bad/negative margins for a while. Almost 1/2 trillion in losses for the next 5 years. Compute is expensive &amp; seems like Google has cracked the code with TpU.

- NeoClouds have been approached by Google and some have started to deploy the TpU at scale for cloud hosting. Initial trials to see how market response is. Other large customer amd contracts that have been rumored for $GOOGL is $META &amp; Xai. Both who are huge nvida customers! 


This news will be digested over the weekend but my positions are set on this. I am in a pair trade with long $GOOGL shares + $AVGO calls and short on $NVDA/$AMD.
It does seem like googles full stack approach is working well and we are seeing gemini take on other world models, Google cloud ☁️ dominance over Aws/AZURE and then ToU taking market share from Nvida. Firing in on all fronts.

2,NVDA,Nvidia vs Google heats up after Meta considers switching chips,"Nvidia usually keeps quiet when competitors make moves, but this week was different. After reports came out that Meta is in advanced talks to spend billions on Google’s AI chips instead of Nvidia’s, the company actually put out a statement defending its market position. That rarely happens, and it shows how seriously they’re taking Google’s TPU push. The reaction was immediate Nvidia’s stock took a heavy hit, wiping out around $250B in market value in a day. At the same time, Alphabet shares jumped because Wall Street is starting to see TPUs as a real alternative, not just an internal Google tool. Nvidia still controls more than 90% of the AI accelerator market, so it’s not like they’re suddenly in trouble. But this is one of the first times they’ve been forced into *responding* rather than leading the narrative. According to The Information, Google has been pitching TPUs hard to major clients (including Meta and big financial institutions), and these customers could represent up to 10% of Nvidia’s annual revenue. Feels like the first real crack in Nvidia’s dominance we’ve seen so far.

253,NVDA,What are the repercussions of falling OpenAI valuation?,"There is a lot of speculation now that OpenAI is cooked since their spending is huge with not much revenue yet and most of the AI are caught up with their best models.

OpenAI is not a public company but it is like the mascot of the AI companies and the startup companies.

Just assume that OpenAI is not able to even get a 50 billion market cap after they go IPO, a 90% drop from their current valuation of 500 billion.

Will these affect other AI companies. From what I know, google will be very happy since their current business continues as usual, while they seriously release AI stuff. 

Same with Amazon and facebook, no affect to their business. I am guessing Microsoft may suffer a bit of a loss to their valuation since they got around 25+% share in OpenAI, IIRC.

My hunch is: this will be the end of startup craze and billion dollar companies with no revenue. Or how about many of them worth 20-40 billion already.

But how will this affect the current public companies like say Oracle, IBM, NVidia, AMD, etc?",164,102,1764297230.0,2025-11-28T02:33:50+00:00,t3_1p8jm5i,stocks
254,NVDA,"Everyone is chasing NVIDIA, but Micron might be the better risk and reward","NVIDIA continues to dominate the AI narrative due to the scarcity of computing chips and ecosystem barriers, yet the market often overlooks another equally critical and even more resilient during AI expansion cycles sector: storage and high bandwidth memory. Micron stands as the primary beneficiary here. As AI training scales up exponentially, GPU performance is no longer the sole bottleneck. HBM, DRAM, and enterprise grade SSD sessential for feeding data to computing power are becoming indispensable components in next generation data centers. Each GPU iteration from NVIDIA drives concurrent demand for higher bandwidth, higher capacity, and lower power storage solutions, propelling Micron into a “second curve” within the AI supply chain.   
  
Over the past year, the AI industry has shifted from a “computing power first” approach to an “computing power + memory synergy” architecture upgrade. Micron's HBM3E has already been integrated into multiple leading AI accelerator card solutions. Data center DRAM prices and demand are rebounding in tandem, demonstrating the strong, certain pull of the AI cycle on the storage end. Compared to NVIDIA's high valuation and crowded trading, Micron sits in a valuation trough yet holds key resources for AI expansion. Its performance is more sensitive to AI server shipments, exhibiting higher beta, yet market attention remains mismatched with its strategic importance. In the long term AI cycle, computing power companies tell the story, while memory companies deliver profits. NVIDIA is the engine of the AI era, while Micron is the lubrication system that keeps that engine running at high RPM. As the market begins to reprice the comprehensive scarcity of AI infrastructure. Does this mean that Micron Technology's potential for catching up may warrant greater attention?",209,103,1764273699.0,2025-11-27T20:01:39+00:00,t3_1p8bmer,stocks
255,NVDA,Nvidia just posted 57 billion in revenue are you buying the business or the price,"Nvidia’s latest quarter was huge. Revenue was 57 billion dollars, up 62%year on year. Net income was 31.8 billion dollars, up 59%. Earnings per share reached 1.30 dollars, up 60%. Guidance for next quarter is revenue around 65 billion dollars with a small range and gross margin near 75%.

The question now is pretty simple….. If you buy Nvidia at this level, are you paying for future cash flow or mainly taking over a price that several rounds of money already pushed up. A lot of people are basically thinking as long as the AI story holds, Nvidia is the main way to play it, putting the price at which it is traded in second place. That pulls more attention to a few mega caps and less to finding value in the rest of the market.

If you zoom out, a big part of Nvidia’s growth was captured earlier by private and early public money. On the private side, there are new setups that break unlisted equity into smaller units that can be registered and tracked. Jarsy is one of the tools that try to map private shares into one to one on chain units and record who holds what, while rules and risk control are still being tested.

This earnings report will likely push AI valuations higher again. For your own portfolio, trading swings in a few giant names and thinking about how early equity is sliced and allocated are two different games. One is about riding price moves, the other is about standing closer to the real assets before the story shows up in headline numbers. Curious how people in here see this trade off with Nvidia right now?",0,18,1764241361.0,2025-11-27T11:02:41+00:00,t3_1p7zip4,stocks
3,NVDA,Nvidia's momentum meets fresh competition as robotics buzz heats up,"Nvidia’s CEO hinted that a major robotics reveal is on the way, which has naturally kicked up excitement around what the company might be planning next. But at the same time, competition in the AI chip space is getting louder. Meta considering a deal with Google for TPUs has added some pressure, and investors are watching closely to see if this shifts any market share away from Nvidia.Meanwhile, Chinese firms that were set back by U.S. chip restrictions seem to be adapting by training their AI models overseas, which still puts them in reach of Nvidia’s tech through indirect channels.Despite all this noise, Nvidia’s revenue track record is still absurdly strong the company has grown from $5.9B to $57B in just 13 quarters, averaging over 16% growth per quarter. So while competition is definitely real, the fundamentals are still holding up.

256,NVDA,OpenAI’s 200m paying user goal by 2030 is delusional. Here is the bear case nobody talks about.,"Saw the news that OpenAI expects to hit 220 million paying users by 2030. That is roughly 14x their current subscriber count.

I have been crunching the numbers and looking at the competitive landscape since the Gemini 3.0 / Claude Opus 4.5 releases, and honestly? The math is broken.

There is a massive bias in this sub and on Reddit in general. We are the power users. We are the ones digging into specific use cases or coding workflows. But we are a tiny bubble. The vast majority of OpenAI’s 800M+ weekly active users are free-tier casuals who use it to write a birthday email or summarize a PDF. They have zero loyalty because ""good enough"" is all they need.

Here is my analysis why the fundamentals won't support the valuation:

1. The ""Amazon"" comparison is lazy
People keep saying ""Amazon wasn't profitable for 20 years"" to justify OpenAI burning billions. It is a bad comparison. Amazon spent money building warehouses, logistics networks, and eventually their own data centers. They were building assets they owned. The spend was on Capex.
OpenAI is spending billions on Opex. They are renting compute from Microsoft and Oracle. Look at the numbers: they have a $300 Billion commitment to Oracle and over $22 Billion committed to CoreWeave. They do not own the infrastructure. They are renting the penthouse. If Amazon stopped spending, they still had a massive delivery network. If OpenAI stops spending, the server lights go out immediately.

2. Startup 101: Validate, Dominate, then Expand
Normally, to become a platform, you dominate one vertical first. Amazon dominated books. Google dominated search. Once you have the cash flow and the users, you expand.
OpenAI is trying to skip the ""dominate"" phase. They are throwing spaghetti at the wall. Search, Voice, Canvas, Sora, Shopping. They are trying to disrupt markets without validating the demand first. Meanwhile, they are losing the one vertical they actually had. Recent data suggests Anthropic has already flipped the enterprise API market, taking a 30%+ share while OpenAI slides down to 25% because developers prefer Claude for coding.

3. The Google Trap
Most users are on the free plan. What happens if OpenAI forces them to pay? They leave. What happens if they flood the chat with ads to monetize the free users? They leave.
Google knows this. They are likely just waiting for OpenAI to break the user experience to capture the churn. The ""Gemini for Students"" move was genius because it gets users hooked on the ecosystem (Docs/Drive) for free. (600 Mio Gemini users! App, not including search! Probably highly overlapping with OpenAI's userbase). When OpenAI puts up a wall, Google will be there with open arms to capture the 98% of users who won't pay $20/month.

4. The AGI Hype vs. Reality
We need to be real about the tech. Transformers are just huge attention networks creating probabilistic links between words. They are non-deterministic. They do not ""think"" or understand physics.
You cannot build a safe AGI on a system that is fundamentally a randomizer. This is why the experts are leaving. Ilya Sutskever left to start SSI. John Schulman left. Yann LeCunn left Meta. In late 2025 alone, over 20 top researchers left OpenAI and Google to work on ""World Models"" because they know Transformers have hit a ceiling.
Also, do not fall for the CEO marketing trap. When Sam Altman says ""I am afraid this tech will destroy us,"" that is just hype generation. Danger implies capability. It is the best way to mask the fact that the models are plateauing.

5. The Financials are a Horror Show
Let’s look at the actual 2025 numbers that have leaked.
For the first half of 2025, they generated about $4.3 Billion in revenue. Sounds good? Not when you see the burn.
Reports suggest they lost nearly $13.5 Billion in the same period.
Even worse, Microsoft’s earnings leaks implied OpenAI lost another $12 Billion just in Q3 2025.
They are burning cash faster than they can print it. The ""circular financing"" loop (Nvidia invests -&gt; OpenAI buys chips -&gt; Nvidia books revenue) is the only thing propping up the narrative. When you are losing $3 for every $1 you make, you are not a platform. You are a subsidy machine for Microsoft's cloud division.

And if the circular revenue doesn't scare you, look at the employee compensation timebomb. OpenAI doesn't give normal stock; they give PPUs (Profit Participation Units). Because of their capped-profit structure, these aren't ownership stakes, but moreover promises of future profit distributions. As the valuation skyrockets to ~$500B, the accounting value of these ""promises"" explodes. On a balance sheet, this scales like a massive liability. If they ever want to IPO or convert to a standard Public Benefit Corporation (which they are desperately trying to do right now/are in proceeds to do), they have to convert these PPUs. That conversion would trigger a compensation expense so large it would likely wipe out their ""paper"" profits for the next decade. They are effectively borrowing against their own hype to pay their staff.

6. Zero Moat
People argue that ""Chat History"" is a moat. It isn't. I exported my ChatGPT history to JSON and imported it into a local client in 5 minutes. Switching from ChatGPT to Gemini 3.0 took me 30 seconds.

Conclusion
I have to end with a question. The people running OpenAI are YC alums and some of the smartest minds in tech. They know how startups work. They know you need to validate problems and dominate verticals. Yet everything they are doing screams the exact opposite.
Are they just bad at productizing, where overhelmed by the hype of LLMs themself and strategically not prepared or is there some 4D chess strategy here that I am completely missing? Because from where I am standing, they look less like Google and more like Uber in 2015.",1046,274,1764237192.0,2025-11-27T09:53:12+00:00,t3_1p7ye30,stocks

257,NVDA,Broadcom DD: Highly overvalued,"As of today, Broadcom's marketcap is roughly 1.8T (it's closer to 1.9T but still) Nvidia's marketcap in comparison is roughly 4.3T This brings Broadcom at about 40% valuation of Nvidia



Now Broadcom made about 15.9 B dollars in profit, for a 4.2 B in Net Revenue.



About 9.2 B ( \~ 60%) comes from Semiconductor related business And the rest, 6.8 B (\~ 40%) comes from Software



Now Broadcom bought VMware and increased prices by a lot, so much that they gained a lot of ill-will, and those who can try to get out of their ecosystem. They are taking a page out of Oracle's book, and this will hold companies hostage for a while, but the price increases are so insane, going up to 10x, that some companies either must find an alternative, or risk going bankrupt. \[1\] \[2\]



I believe, Broadcom will stagnate in growth in their software department, but will increase prices to bleed dry existing customers as much as they can, the issue is in the VM space, there are some big players, such as Microsoft and already existing open source projects such as ProxMox that is gaining tractions \[3\]



But This isn't what I want to talk about, and this isn't the reason for their latest rally, it's their semiconductor division, and the latest google TPU Meta deal.



Broadcom has a gross margin of roughly 67% I am going to reasonably assume that they have a way higher margin on their software division compared to their chips division. I am going to assume a reasonable, yet very optimistic gross margin of 60% on their chip divisions, slightly higher than what Qualcom or Marvel gets, which designed and helped fab Amazon's AI chips. This leaves roughly 75% gross margin for their software division. I believe their software margins are way higher, and their chip divisions are lower but it doesn't matter.



Their operating margins are way lower, at 26%.



So on purely current revenue and profitability, I am going to compare to Nvidia's Q2 to make it fairer, since they have more than 2 months delay between their earnings.



in Q2 Nvidia had a gross revenue of 45 B, or almost 3x (2.9x) Broadcom's Q3 revenue In Terms of Net Income Nvidia did 26.4B, which is even more drastic of a difference compared to Broadcom's 6.2x !



So this puts proportionally Broadcom at 40 % valuation of Nvidia, does 34 % Gross Revenue, But 16 % Net Revenue



For the sake of the argument, If Nvidia went full panic mode, and decreased their insane margins to undercut Broadcom, at 20% margins, Nvidia would still do 9B in revenue, which is more than 2x what Broadcom does now.



Now in terms of the future, they helped design googles TPUs but google owns the IP. And in the openAI deal, openAI is to design and own the IP (And Microsoft will also have rights due to their arrangements, so Broadcom will be paid to help the design and in the manufacturing, but they aren't going further than this.


EDIT 1 Growth:

I wanted to add a section on growth,

Q3 saw a 6 % growth overall from Q2 and a 22% YoY
In terms of the Chip division, it saw a roughly 9% increase from Q2

Their own projections for Q4 expect a 9 % growth from Q3

This is below both nvidia's and AMD Q/Q growth

This is why Broadcom only shows YoY growth and not Q/Q like AMD or Nvidia, to make their growth look better.

Based on this, Broadcom would have to 6x their semiconductor revenue in 2026 to justify their current valuation, which does not reflect at all their current growth.

Current projections include existing google TPU demand, so even if you double it to include say openAI demand, it is still not realistic to hit such levels.

EDIT 2 Debt:

Broadcom also has lots of debt, they took a bit of short term debt, a small increase from 2024 at 1.4 B

But they also have a 62 B long term debt

Even if they are decreasing debt from 2024, they still have a an insane debt to revenue as well as equity ratio.



Both AMD and Nvidia have proportionally way less debt.

1,NVDA,"An Event Got Me Exploring Stock Futures, and I Didn’t Expect to Actually Like It","I started exploring stock futures recently because I came across an event that focused on trading popular names like TSLA, NVDA, AAPL and a bunch of others on Bitget. A lot of my peers have been into stocks recently but i never tried.

I’ve always thought stocks were too complicated or “too serious” for me, but once I actually tried them, it felt surprisingly manageable.

There was a set trading window and reduced fees during it, which made it easier to experiment without feeling pressured. Following the price movements in real time and seeing how futures react gave me a different kind of insight compared to just holding stocks.



It honestly gave me that “okay, I’m really growing into this finance thing” feeling. I didn’t expect to enjoy it, but the structure and pace of futures made the whole experience feel more mature and intentional than I thought it would.

I stuck mostly to TSLA, NVDA, MSTR and GOOGL because they’re the one i knew some of my friends followed daily, and seeing how futures react to volatility in real time gave me a deeper understanding of their intraday behavior",0,9,1764195304.0,2025-11-26T22:15:04+00:00,t3_1p7l7uz,stocks

258,NVDA,Full recap - Interview with Nebius CRO Marc Boroditsky,"Hi folks!

Watched a recent interview online with Nebius CRO Marc Boroditsky and thought I'd share a full recap here because I keep seeing posts and comments that tell me many people still fail to understand the industry as a whole and more specifically Nebius' long term vision and market positioning.

For key segments that I do believe are still highly misunderstood to this day, they are mostly discussed in #8, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 17.

Disclaimer: I am invested in Nebius and the interview was led by Nebius investors and Nebius leadership (CRO Marc Boroditsky). Although I do agree with everything that was discussed in the interview, I am aware that many people share different opinions and will disagree with various things that were said in the interview. I am also aware that many people either do not believe in Nebius long term success or see better opportunities with other players in the market for various reasons, which is totally fair. Hence, feel free to express your thoughts in the comments below.

I am sharing this here for information purposes only since Nebius Group is a popular choice among retail.

In case you are looking for the interview, it can be easily be found online. It's called ''$30B AI Expert: The Real Money is in Inference - Nebius CRO Marc Boroditsky''. Can't share it here.

RECAP below:

1. Interviewers asked how Nebius managed to close such massive multibillion-dollar deals with tech giants like Microsoft and Meta so quickly given the company is relatively new to the market

Marc explains that while he would love to take the credit, it was actually a massive cross-functional effort involving the corporate development, legal, platform, and infrastructure teams who navigated these complex negotiations from start to finish. He points out that winning the trust of these iconic companies required proving that Nebius had the rigorous legal framework and operational maturity to serve as a reliable long-term partner for the world's largest enterprises. He mentions that these deals aren't just simple transactions but require a deep alignment on infrastructure, reliability, and compliance that only a fully matured organization can deliver.

2. Interviewers asked if the guidance of reaching 7 to 9 billion in revenue by 2026 is actually achievable given the extreme logistical challenges of building data centers at that speed

Marc explains that they are treating physical infrastructure with the same agile methodology used in software development. This allows them to run multiple supply chain and power acquisition tracks in parallel (""multi-threaded"") rather than doing things sequentially. He notes that typical infrastructure deployment takes years because companies wait for one step to complete before starting the next (e.g., waiting for a permit to begin planning). Nebius compresses these timelines by operating simultaneously on all fronts. He confirms that the contracts and equipment orders needed to hit these numbers are already being executed right now rather than just being a plan on paper for the future. He says their confidence comes from the fact that they aren't waiting for permits to start planning but are moving on all fronts simultaneously to compress timelines, maintaining the ""thirst and drive"" of a startup even at scale.

3. Interviewers asked for a specific breakdown of what the difference is between contracted power and connected power in their financial reports and why that distinction matters for investors

Marc explains that ""contracted power"" means having a legally binding agreement with a utility or supplier to provide energy capacity, whereas ""connected power"" means the electricity is live, in production, and ready for servers to run revenue-generating workloads. He says that the leadership team is extremely sensitive to only reporting milestones that are fully matured and actionable, rather than sharing ""half-baked"" or speculative capacity that might never materialize. This distinction is very important because it shows they are only counting power that is secured and commercially viable.

4. Interviewers asked about their pricing power and if they are taking advantage of the current shortage of GPU compute to charge maximum rates to every customer

Marc admits that while the extreme supply imbalance would allow them to charge high premiums, they are strategically choosing to prioritize long term relationships over maximizing short-term profit. They prioritize Large Enterprises (e.g., Fortune 500 companies), High-Growth AI Natives (startups with clear runway and technical focus), and Major Software Vendors (ISVs). These clients are selected based on their commitment to a long-term partnership and their need for a full-stack, secure, high-performance solution. He explains that their goal is to support companies that will grow with them over the long term, meaning they sometimes say ""no"" today to keep the door open for a more strategic ""yes"" tomorrow. This disciplined approach is fundamental to building a durable, high-quality recurring revenue stream.

5. Interviewers asked what the biggest limiting factor is for scaling the business right now and if getting Nvidia chips is still the main problem for Nebius

Marc makes it clear that access to GPUs is effectively solved due to their privileged, high-level partnership with Nvidia, so the real bottlenecks are now physical assets like land availability and power capacity, as well as the capital required to fund them. He adds that having the massive capital required to actually purchase the equipment to fill these data centers is the other major hurdle. Nebius has successfully overcome this due to their clean balance sheet and capital engines, such as their ATM facility and debt structures. He implies that while others struggle to find chips, Nebius is purely focused on the logistics of deploying the hardware they have already secured access to.

6. Interviewers asked how they approach green energy and if they have strict sustainability mandates that might slow down their deployment at new data center sites

Marc explains that their decision-making is primarily financial and pragmatic. They are willing to use various energy sources, including gas or nuclear, as long as the deal meets their strict internal rate of return (IRR) and margin requirements. He explicitly states that their focus is on securing the lowest possible cost of energy to maintain their superior unit economics. He mentions they are open to using temporary power solutions to get sites running quickly while they work on transitioning to more permanent and efficient power configurations over time. He clarifies that while they care about sustainability, they won't let ""perfect"" energy sources be the enemy of getting deployed fast enough to meet customer demand, noting they are energy consumers, not producers, meaning their priority is securing reliable, low-cost power quickly, regardless of the source.

7. Interviewers asked about growth metrics beyond just new customer acquisition, specifically regarding net dollar retention and how existing customers are expanding their usage

Marc points out that while year-over-year comparisons are difficult given the company's youth, their quarter-over-quarter expansion is extremely robust. Major accounts, like software vendors, are often doubling their usage sequentially, growing at rates above typical SaaS (Software as a Service) growth rates. He notes a shift in workloads from ""spiky"" model training to more predictable and reliable inferencing workloads, which he believes is where the real commercialization of AI lies. He says that as customers move from training to retraining and then to inferencing, the ""stickiness"" and revenue consistency improve significantly, driving growth rates that exceed typical SaaS benchmarks.

8. Interviewers asked if he is worried about competition from Bitcoin miners who are pivoting to offer AI compute services and if that supply will hurt Nebius

Marc doesn't see this as a threat because running high-performance AI clouds requires complex engineering, cooling, and software discipline that crypto miners simply don't possess or understand. He differentiates their capabilities, noting that miners excel at managing simple, homogeneous hash workloads, but lack the ability to handle the complex, heterogeneous orchestration needed for serious AI training and inferencing. He states that sophisticated customers running mission-critical workloads will always choose a company with deep technical roots over a converted mining operation that cannot guarantee uptime, security, or proper orchestration. He believes the market for AI infrastructure is distinct because it requires a full software stack and support layer (the ""AI Cloud"") that miners cannot easily replicate just by plugging in GPUs.

9. Interviewers asked if Nebius would consider acquiring any of these Bitcoin miners to gain access to their power and land assets given the scarcity of infrastructure

Marc admits that ""crazy markets make strange bedfellows"" and that they look at all options, but he says they prefer to build and control their own infrastructure to ensure unit economics, reliability and performance. He suggests that while they are open to any opportunities and very creative, they would likely pass on most M&amp;A opportunities in this space because the miners often don't ""check all the boxes"" required for Nebius's high standards. He reaffirms that maintaining control over every detail of the infrastructure is key to their long-term operational success.

10. Interviewers asked about the current market realities and skepticism regarding the valuations and asking prices of these potential infrastructure targets

Marc points out that we are currently in a ""crazy market"" where valuations for these assets are often irrational and don't make financial sense for a disciplined buyer. He states that sellers often expect prices far beyond what is rational. This means Nebius, which is focused on margins and unit economics, would likely only consider such moves during a market pullback when prices return to reality. He frames this discipline not as a lack of ambition but as a refusal to overpay for assets that don't justify their cost.

11. Interviewers asked about the future of the ""rental"" business model and if bare-metal GPU rental is destined to become a commodity race to the bottom

Marc agrees that for a small subset of the market comfortable with ""DIY"" (Do it Yourself) infrastructure, bare metal will become a commodity. He notes that Nebius is fine with this commodity business existing on the side, since their focus is strictly on the premium, full-stack opportunity. He says that the vast majority of the market (two-thirds of IT spend) comes from enterprises that demand a full-service experience. He explains that these large organizations (like Proctor &amp; Gamble or Pfizer) don't want to manage raw hardware. They want a fully integrated platform that handles the complexity for them. He says that bare-metal providers only offer one small piece of the solution (the GPU), leaving the client responsible for building the rest of the stack (the managed Kubernetes, networking, security, and observability), which can cost millions or require cobbling together services from third-party vendors. He says Nebius is avoiding the ""race to the bottom"" by focusing on this premium, value-added layer rather than just renting out raw server capacity.

12. Interviewers asked about the specific nature of enterprise demand and whether large legacy companies are actually moving to these new AI platforms

Marc explains that enterprises are increasingly moving to service providers that offer a full stack of capabilities because ""operating the lower layers"" internally is inefficient and costly for them. He mentions that even if a ""bare metal"" option looks cheaper on a price-per-hour basis, it ends up losing the customer money due to the massive operational overhead required to manage it. He states that enterprises do not want to spend months cobbling together a functional AI environment because their focus must be on time-to-market and their core business objectives (e.g., selling cars, discovering drugs). The opportunity cost of diverting highly paid engineers to manage infrastructure far outweighs any perceived hardware savings. He predicts that the same dynamic seen in the cloud era, where customers flocked to integrated providers like AWS, will play out in AI. Enterprises will choose Nebius for the seamless ecosystem and speed of deployment rather than raw cost savings.

13. Interviewers asked how Nebius differentiates itself from the major hyperscalers (AWS, Azure, Google) and the other players emerging

Marc breaks the market down into three categories: 1) Bare metal ""digital real estate"" players, 2) Traditional hyperscalers who rely on ""cookie-cutter"" uniformity to manage scale, and 3) ""Specialty Infrastructure"" players like Nebius. He explains that hyperscalers struggle with the specialized needs of AI workloads because their business models depend on commoditization and standardization, which forces them to appeal to the ""lowest common denominator"" user. In contrast, Nebius is building a platform specifically optimized for the AI engineer, not the generalist DevOps engineer. This specialization allows them to support distinct, high-performance workloads (like drug discovery or robotics) that generalist clouds cannot serve as effectively.

14. Interviewers asked for a deeper explanation of ""Specialty Infrastructure"" and why it can compete effectively against giants like AWS

Marc compares this to companies like Cloudflare, which compete with hyperscalers by doing one specific thing (security/networking) significantly better and more efficiently. He argues that ""Specialty Infrastructure"" for AI allows Nebius to capture premium workloads that demand higher performance and reliability, thereby commanding better margins. This advantage isn't just software deep, but comes from engineering architecture built specifically for the most complex AI tasks, which is structurally difficult for generalist clouds to replicate. By focusing entirely on the needs of the AI engineer rather than the generalist DevOps engineer, Nebius creates a ""best-of-breed"" solution that justifies a premium valuation and market position.

15. Interviewers asked about the importance of cybersecurity in this integrated cloud and if it is a major factor for their enterprise customers

Marc confirms that security is absolutely critical. He notes that as workloads move to inferencing over the internet, identity access management and data protection become mandatory. He explains that customers are putting their most valuable IP on the platform, so Nebius must deliver security parity with the hyperscalers. He says that you cannot simply offer compute, you must deliver the full ""Dev-Ops-Security"" wrapper (managed Kubernetes, observability, identity) to be a viable partner for serious enterprises. He confirms that Nebius is offering the whole Dev-Ops-Security package.

16. Interviewers asked if there is concrete feedback from customers proving that their vertical integration and software platform actually create a competitive advantage

Marc shares a story about a CTO of a large software vendor who moved workloads to Nebius specifically because ""my engineers like your platform better."" He explains that the ""stickiness"" of the product comes from the behavioral preference of developers who find Nebius's tooling and spin-up times superior. He argues that this long-term stickiness is less about traditional technical lock-in and more about winning the ""hearts and minds"" of the AI engineer persona, who are ""creatures of habit"" with their tools. He specifically cites his experience at Twilio, stating that once you get an engineer on the platform, the next time they have a workload, they just start with that platform. This creates a powerful flywheel effect meaning engineers who learn how to run workloads on Nebius will start asking for it in future roles and organizations, creating sales opportunities that ""come through the back door."" Nebius is actively fueling this by hiring a developer relations leader to build a multi-million AI engineer community around their platform. He adds that because Nebius hires extremely high-quality, high-level engineers for their support teams, they manage to bypass the traditional L1/L2/L3 escalation model common in the industry. This means that when customers call, the initial engineer can often solve the problem immediately, which drives confidence, trust, and continued usage versus competitors that need to constantly escalate. He states that customers know the performance and reliability advantages of an integrated platform are worth paying a premium for, rather than risking fragmented, cobble-together solutions just to save a few cents per hour.

17. Interviewers asked how the revenue and profit split between their infrastructure services and their software platform will evolve over the coming years

Marc predicts that while hardware drives revenue now, the software and platform layer (the ""AI Cloud"") will eventually generate the majority of their profit and value. He compares their trajectory to other major cloud providers where the real margin comes from proprietary tools, storage, and inferencing services rather than the raw infrastructure itself. He emphasizes that building and maintaining this sophisticated AI software platform requires extremely high-end, highly specialized engineers. He points out that for many companies, it is already difficult and expensive to find any engineers, let alone highly skilled AI engineers, making the talent required to build an internal platform a massive barrier to entry. He shares a story of a large software vendor customer with 21 different AI product teams who needs a single software ""control plane"" to manage them. He says that this isn't possible today and that it shows the massive long-term opportunity lies in solving these software complexity problems instead of just renting GPUs.

18. Interviewers asked why Marc decided to join Nebius after his previous successes and what specific factors convinced him to commit to this role

Marc says that after leaving Cloudflare, he was looking for a ""horizontal"" platform opportunity rather than a vertical application or a risky foundation model company. He was ultimately convinced by Nebius because it combined a massive total addressable market (TAM) with a ""capital engine"" capable of fueling growth and a leadership team (Arkady, Roman, Andrey) that was ""humble yet technically brilliant."" He highlights Nebius's unique origin story, leveraging the core team's experience in building high-scale, AI-driven infrastructure from their time at Yandex. He saw the three critical ingredients for success such as industry-leading technology, an outstanding team, and ready access to growth capital. He notes that finding a company that already had a working commercial product, a clean balance sheet, and the engineering culture to execute on a generational vision was a rare alignment that turned him from a skeptic into a closer.

19. Interviewers asked what makes him most excited about the future and what investors should look for in the coming execution phase

Marc is excited about the ""execution"" phase, which is all about building a go-to-market machine that can reach the ""four corners of the market"" to sell the massive capacity they are bringing online. He emphasizes that execution means the massive and complex task of operationalizing the deployed capacity and effectively commercializing the software platform at scale. He talks about the impending ""enterprise stampede"" into AI, predicting that while legacy companies are slow to move now, Nebius is positioning itself to capture that massive wave when it breaks by focusing on delivering enterprise-ready, full-stack AI services. He wraps up by saying this is the biggest ""generational opportunity"" of his career and that he's confident Nebius will become an ""iconic company"" that defines this new era of infrastructure.",43,16,1764188971.0,2025-11-26T20:29:31+00:00,t3_1p7ikzs,stocks

259,NVDA,OpenAI reportedly aiming for 1 trillion dollar IPO valuation is this still an opportunity,"OpenAI is talking with banks and law firms about an IPO, and the internal target is \~ 1 trillion dollar valuation….? If it lists at that size, it would sit next to Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia at the top of the tech market. The rough timeline is filing in the second half of 2026, trading between late 2026 and 2027, and raising at least 60 billion dollars, with the final size based on growth and market mood.

For a company this big, most of the real upside usually happens before the IPO, Early shares stay with the founding team, large funds, and strategic partners, so by the time regular investors see the ticker, the valuation has already moved through several rounds. But, on the private side it is no longer only traditional VC. There are new setups that try to break unlisted equity into smaller pieces and make it easier to register and track. One is Jarsy, which is moving in that direction and wants to narrow the gap in information and access between the primary and secondary markets, although risk and regulation are still in a testing stage.

If OpenAI finally comes to market at close to 1 trillion dollars, it will reset the pricing anchor for the whole AI sector and make it very clear who was inside long before the listing. For most people in here, the real question is whether an IPO like this is still an actual entry point or just an exit door for early money?",0,58,1764183446.0,2025-11-26T18:57:26+00:00,t3_1p7g6sx,stocks

252,NVDA,Is the U.S. Stock rally a dead cat bounce?,"Regarding whether the U.S. stock market is experiencing a rebound or a true reversal, I’d like to share several key data points:

1️⃣ Since the beginning of Q4 2025, earnings expectations for AI-related stocks have been revised upward, indicating sustained positive momentum for the world’s most important investment theme.

2️⃣ GDP expectations remain solid. For instance, Goldman Sachs expects compound GDP growth to outperform market consensus.

3️⃣ Corporate earnings have also been strong. It’s fair to say the stock market's robust performance is supported by consistently solid corporate profits. This strong positive earnings sentiment is particularly evident in the U.S. – last week, FactSet slightly raised its earnings estimates for the S&amp;P 500 for both 2025 and 2026.

4️⃣ Overall U.S. productivity is rising. I believe we should pay close attention to the permanently higher level of earnings driven by productivity gains.

5️⃣ Market fund inflows remain strong. This year, U.S. equity inflows are the second-highest in history, while U.S. equity issuance remains relatively low. For example, the number of IPOs and secondary offerings in the TMT sector over the past 12 months has stayed at low levels – meaning supply has actually decreased.

8,NVDA,Google just became an existential threat to OpenAI.,"Here's what happened just in the last few months: 

* Google was able to scale its AI quickly, and Gemini now has 650 million monthly active users, a stone's throw away from OpenAI’s 800 million.
* Fears that AI is cannibalizing traditional search seem misplaced with search revenue growing 15% YoY as reported on Alphabet’s latest quarter.
* The market is now realizing that Alphabet is the only company that has hardware, a foundation model, and distribution.

Google [released](https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-3/) its latest model, Gemini 3, and it absolutely blew the competition away in benchmark testing.

https://preview.redd.it/e9cuwurjaf3g1.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d6f184c929261efbb626877e228c2cc4fd9c474

The kicker? Google used its own processors *(TPUs)* and not Nvidia chips to train the Gemini 3 model. This means Google has just leapfrogged OpenAI in the competition, and the structural advantages are now becoming evident.

* Google has 4 billion users across Search, YouTube, and Gmail who generate valuable training data for their models. Compared to this, all the data OpenAI uses must either be scraped from the web *(which raises copyright issues)* or acquired from other companies *(which worsens their margins)*.



* The TPUs that Google used for training their latest model are designed by Google itself and integrated directly into Google’s data centers. While there are rumors that TPUs are better for machine learning workloads as they are custom-designed *(vis-a-vis GPUs)*, the critical point is that Google can avoid Nvidia's premium *(Nvidia has a 75% margin on its chips)* that OpenAI has to pay.



* Finally, Gemini is gaining market share rapidly. Now that they have the best model and lower generation costs, they can instantly distribute it to their 4 billion-user base, thereby undercutting OpenAI’s first-mover advantage. Most users don’t care which AI they use as long as it gets the job done.

3,NVDA,"Explain the Google, TSMC, Nvidia dynamic to me","**Update: I’d like to think some people at Wallstreet read this post and concluded it made no sense for TSM to go down with NVDA. If you bought the TSM dip when I wrote this post, you'd be up 4%. Enjoy the small profit on me.**

TSM tends to trade with Nvidia. Nvidia goes up, TSM goes up. Makes sense. AI trade.

Google goes up because Meta wants to buy access to their TPUs. Google needs to make more TPUs to sell to Meta right? So Google needs to make more TPUs at TSM. Google only makes TPUs at TSMC. Not Samsung. Not Intel.

**So why is Google up today, TSM down? Where does the market think Google makes their AI chips?** Are Wallstreet/traders this brainless that they don't even know TSM wins regardless of whether they're making Google TPUs or Nvidia GPUs? TSM doesn't give a damn who is buying their wafers. It makes no difference to TSM if Google or Apple or Nvidia or AMD or Broadcom buys the wafer.

PS. Meta wanting to buy some Google TPUs isn't entirely bad for Nvidia. After all, Meta is also building internal AI chips with Broadcom. Everyone is trying to not go all in on Nvidia because it's a risk to rely on a single supplier. Since Nvidia chips are literally sold out for one whole year, if Meta needs more compute now, they have no where to go to. The only options for Meta are Broadcom custom chips (already doing that), AMD chips (already doing that), or Google TPUs (finally doing it now). This is a bull signal for entire AI market because Meta doesn't have enough chips.",289,214,1764081713.0,2025-11-25T14:41:53+00:00,t3_1p6e5nl,stocks

9,NVDA,NVDA down after Meta explores Google’s AI chips,"Nvidia is taking a hit this morning after a report from The Information suggested Meta might shift part of its future AI infrastructure toward Google’s in-house chips. NVDA is down around 3 to 4% in premarket, while Alphabet is getting a decent bump.According to the report, Meta is considering adopting Google’s TPUs in its data centers starting in 2027, and may even rent TPU capacity from Google Cloud as early as next year. Google’s been building out its TPU lineup since 2018, and the newer versions are optimized specifically for large-scale AI workloads. The idea is that Google can offer something more tightly integrated and potentially more efficient than off the shelf GPUs.If Meta actually goes ahead with this, it would be a pretty meaningful win for Google not just because of the business, but because it would validate Google’s long push to differentiate itself with its own silicon. For Nvidia, this doesn’t change its dominant position today, but it does show that big AI players are at least exploring alternatives instead of relying 100% on GPUs.
Is this just Meta hedging its options, or could we actually see large AI companies start moving workloads away from Nvidia over the next few years?",296,57,1764066962.0,2025-11-25T10:36:02+00:00,t3_1p6971d,StockMarket
4,NVDA,This AI bubble has degrees of separation from the actual bubble,"Trigger warning: AI heavy investors will find this post triggering. 

We’re at this stalling point as this month is literally a pause after a 35% bubble formed when logically a 35% correction should’ve followed tariffs etc. But this will not burst like the dotcom burst as there is a degree if separation from companies spending vs companies that are at core producing AI services and AI infrastructure. 

The first-degree players like chipmakers and core infrastructure providers like Nvidia most likely keep riding the wave a bit longer. Their revenues depend directly on AI buildouts, not on the success of the AI based applications and ROI themselves.

The second-degree players who are the B2B consumers of those chips and GPTs are the weak link as they directly need the ROI to maintain spend. As gaps in AI maturity is realized to be nonproductive and the ROI fails to materialize, these companies will realize they’ve been buying compute for dreams that are still a decade away.

This bubble will burst from the outside in - first the AI consumers, then the infrastructure suppliers. The first-degree companies will keep earning until their second-degree customers run out of cash or conviction as their spending doesn’t give them any ROI. 

But some bubbles take time to burst ir just continue to remain in plain site generating fake revenue - 
Social media sites have had a bubble a few years now (and has not burst) with bots causing a circular revenue loop of users causing traffic for ads and that revenue being 30% bot driven. Example: Literally when you pay for advertising your company at meta the traffic you pay for is 30% bots and yet you still pay meta based on the traffic to the ads and your conversion rate takes a hit. But that bubble did not burst because it is priced in. AI bubble is also b2b2c and we are still missing the customer benefits. 

Positions: VOO, MSFT, GOOG, exited NVDA three weeks before earnings. ",0,20,1764039502.0,2025-11-25T02:58:22+00:00,t3_1p61dsv,stocks
5,NVDA,Meta and Google discuss TPU deal as Google targets Nvidia’s lead,"Google is sharply escalating its bid to rival Nvidia in the AI chip race, and Meta is emerging as a potential multibillion-dollar customer, The Information reported Monday evening.

For years, Google has limited its custom tensor processing units (TPUs) to its own cloud data centers, renting them out to companies running large-scale AI workloads. But according to The Information, Google is now pitching the chips for deployment inside customers’ own data centers, marking a major shift in strategy.

One of those customers is Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META). The parent of Facebook and Instagram is reportedly in discussions to spend billions of dollars to integrate Google’s TPUs into its data centers starting in 2027, while also planning to rent TPU capacity from Google Cloud as early as next year. Meta currently relies primarily on Nvidia GPUs for its AI infrastructure.

Alphabet Inc stock rose 2.1% in after-hours trading following the announcement, while NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock slumped 1.8%

If the deal proceeds, it would be a significant validation for Google’s hardware ambitions. The company has told prospective clients - ranging from high-frequency trading firms to large financial institutions, that installing TPUs on-premises can help them meet stringent security and compliance requirements for sensitive data, The Information reports.

The stakes are enormous. Executives inside Google Cloud have suggested that expanding TPU adoption could help the company capture up to 10% of Nvidia’s annual revenue, a haul worth billions.

With demand for AI compute exploding and Nvidia continuing to dominate the supply chain, Google’s play to put TPUs directly into customers’ facilities signals a more aggressive phase in the AI chip wars.

7,NVDA,My high conviction trade of the year: Full ported into META calls (looking good on both ends: technical and fundamental),"TLDR:
Macro: Risk on sentiment + rate cut buy the rumor repricing + end of year FOMO/FOMU trade 

Technical: price reclaiming 600s and hitting EMA + crypto/small cap rally hints a good possibility that market is risk on again.

Fundamentals: META’s valuation now might be considered expensive in a bear market, BUT it’s a bull market now and META is CHEAP!

And position and trade plan at bottom.


—————————————————————-

Buying into strength today as META has reclaimed the 600 level and touching EMA. 

Market sentiment is also recovering as we are getting back to risk on. (Crypto and small cap rally is a good indicator) 

On top of that the rate cut sentiment is coming on again. With the fed in trumps hands, it’s really unlikely that a cut won’t happen so I definitely will buy into a fed cut induced rally (and my prediction is this rally will continue into fomc week with a sell the news event following the cut &amp; market end off the year with a rally). 

This makes me believe that the year end FOMO and FOMU trade is back on again. Where portfolio managers go long on mag 7 or AI names that are underperforming ytd with hopes of a catch up trade.

Fundamentally, META is not cheap but certainly not expensive here:

EV to EBITDA: sub 15x (it’s almost half as cheap as GOOG here - I agree GOOG is a much better business but 50% discount in a bull market riding the AI secular trend? I call this deep fucking value)

also, META trades at 35x FCF. This may seem expensive if you are value investor. But again, we are in a bull market (so story drives price growth, not valuations) plus META has the first mover advantage in the AI secular trend and is still founder led. So I’d argue they deserve a premium and I say this valuation is more than justified here. And let’s compare other mag 7: GOOG 53x FCF, MSFT 45x FCF, AMZN 232x FCF, NVDA 58x FCF. So yeah it’s deep fucking value here. 

Price Target: If we are being conservative here and have META touch its previous valuation highs of ~42x FCF, the price will be $725. (A 20% upside)

PE ratio is pointless as different companies have different capital structures plus it doesn’t work on high growth names so I just look at EV EBITDA and P to FCF instead.


Position &amp; Game plan:

2026 April $700 call a few METU calls across different accounts with May 2026 expirations.

As my modest target price is $725, I’ll be writing month out covered calls with strike above my target to offset some theta and lower my cost basis. 

As for take profit and exits, I will exit around late Jan - mid Fed to avoid theta decay acceleration. If META goes above $700, I will monitor the position closely and exit the trade as soon as day candle breaks below EMA. 

Stop loss: I’ll exit if META breaks below 570, in which case I’ll wait for April lows and then get back in again.

8,NVDA,What the hell is going on with NVDA?,"Nvidia just reported one of the strongest earnings in the entire market. Revenue exploding, guidance raised, demand still ridiculous. Everything about the report screamed strength. Any other company would’ve gone straight up on numbers like that.

Instead, NVDA gets dumped.

And out of nowhere the news cycle flips. Suddenly every headline is about Google’s TPUs, Meta “considering alternatives,” AI spending fears, bubble warnings, all dropping at the exact same time. It feels like the entire narrative suddenly shifted away from Nvidia’s actual results toward boosting Google’s storyline.

The confusing part is that Google’s TPU ecosystem isn’t even close to replacing Nvidia at scale today. Not even remotely. But the fear was enough to push NVDA down like it’s some tiny speculative stock.

This is the company powering the entire AI boom. This is the hardware that every major AI model is running on. And somehow the market decides now is the moment to punish it?

It makes no sense.

Yet the selloff is happening, and because Nvidia is one of the heaviest weights in QQQ, SPY, and the whole semiconductor sector, the drop is pulling the entire market down with it. If this keeps going, it’s the kind of move that can trigger a chain reaction across the indices. Everything follows NVDA right now.

The timing of all this is what feels weird. Google pushes TPU hype, the media instantly amplifies it, NVDA tanks, Google rallies, and suddenly the entire market trades like something catastrophic happened, even though fundamentally nothing changed in the last 24 hours.

It doesn’t look like normal price action. It looks like someone flipped the sentiment switch.

Nvidia didn’t lose half a trillion in real value. It lost confidence because the story was yanked away from its earnings and redirected somewhere else.

The big question is whether this spiral continues and drags the whole market down with it, or whether NVDA stabilizes once people realize the fundamentals didn’t suddenly collapse.

Curious what others think. Is this legit fear, or are we getting pushed into a coordinated panic cycle?",1166,665,1764030516.0,2025-11-25T00:28:36+00:00,t3_1p5y5i7,wallstreetbets

262,NVDA,Nvidia Says It’s Not Enron in Private Memo Refuting Accounting Questions,"A series of prominent stock sales and allegations of accounting irregularities have put Nvidia in the middle of a debate about the value of artificial intelligence and its related stocks.

Now Nvidia is pushing back. In a private seven-page memo sent by Nvidia’s investor relations team to Wall Street analysts over the weekend, the chip maker directly addressed a dozen claims made by skeptical investors.

Nvidia’s memo, which includes fonts in the company’s trademark green color, begins by addressing a social media post from Michael Burry last week, which criticized the company for stock-based compensation dilution and stock buybacks. Burry’s prescient bet against subprime mortgages before the 2008-2009 financial crisis was depicted in the movie The Big Short.

“NVIDIA repurchased $91B shares since 2018, not $112.5B; Mr. Burry appears to have incorrectly included RSU \[restricted stock unit\] taxes. Employee equity grants should not be conflated with the performance of the repurchase program,” Nvidia said in the memo. “Employees benefiting from a rising share price does not indicate the original equity grants were excessive at the time of issuance.”

*Barron’s* reviewed the memo, which initially appeared in social media posts over the weekend, and confirmed its authenticity with multiple Wall Street sources.

Burry told *Barron’s* he disagrees with Nvidia’s response and stands by his analysis. He said he would discuss the topic of the company’s stock-based compensation in more detail in a future report.

Nvidia didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

263,NVDA,Michael Burry launches $379 annual subscription newsletter to lay out his AI bubble views after deregistering hedge fund,"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/24/michael-burry-launches-newsletter-to-lay-out-his-ai-bubble-views-after-deregistering-hedge-fund.html

&gt; Michael Burry, the investor who shot to fame for calling the housing crash before 2008, has launched a Substack newsletter after deregistering his hedge fund, aiming to lay out in detail his increasingly bearish thesis on artificial intelligence. “The Big Short” investor is capitalizing on the massive audience he’s built on X, where 1.6 million followers have long parsed his cryptic posts. His new publication, titled “Cassandra Unchained” with a $379 annual subscription fee, arrives with a familiar warning: He believes markets are once again deep in bubble territory.

&gt; In announcing the launch, Burry referenced the parallels between the late 1990s tech mania and today’s rush into AI and how the bubbles have been ignored by policymakers, in his view. ″Feb 21, 2000: SF Chronicle says I’m short Amazon. Greenspan 2005: ‘bubble in home prices … does not appear likely.’ [Fed Chair Jerome] Powell ’25: ’AI companies actually… are profitable… it’s a different thing. ’I doubted if I ever should come back. I’m back. Please join me,” Burry wrote in a post Sunday night on X. He highlighted then-Fed Chair Alan Greenspan’s 2005 insistence that U.S. housing prices showed no signs of a bubble, just two years before the subprime implosion validated Burry’s famous “Big Short.” And now he contends history is rhyming again.

&gt; Like the dot-com era, investors are extrapolating exponential growth, dismissing profitability concerns and funding massive capital expenditures on the assumption that the technology will rewrite the economy, he believes.   Burry took it as an eerie echo of the assurances offered by Greenspan two decades ago. At the height of the dot-com boom, Burry was publicly short Amazon. Today, he has been openly bearish on the poster children of the AI boom, Nvidia and Palantir",2476,534,1764004020.0,2025-11-24T17:07:00+00:00,t3_1p5mo6h,stocks

5,NVDA,SOUN and BLNK. 2 stocks I will watch this week.,"
Soundhound and Blink Charging are both on the path of finding their footing I believe and are both worthy of people taking the opportunity to buy their public shares this upcoming market week. SOUN is approachable and has free ai apps that still make money with subscriptions that lightly surpass decent. It specializes in conversation, music discovery, and more. Although I personally have doubted their ability to specialize in one thing, I believe their Ceo and management is highly capable and strategic and growth oriented.

Blink charging to me is an electric car charging company that is under the radar and will keep climbing the ladder. They aren’t afraid to take their craft and target underfunded areas, and assert themselves as a household name while still having a ways to go. I also think environmentally and efficiency wise, these type of companies we'll only see more of.

BLNK was able to beat analyst estimates of earnings per share in Q3 CY2025 by 1 cent ($-0.10 vs $-0.11). They also reduced their cash burn by 87 percent. It receives decent government funding from both the U.S and the U.K since it's also expanded there recently. A couple months ago they received 280k pounds of government funding. And as for the United States, less than a week ago it was announced they were rewarded a Sourcewell contract to expand and help government agencies.

SOUN reported a Q3 68% revenue growth recently. And NVIDIA, a powerful partner of Soundhound has done some support for them recently as well with the chief executive publicly backing up the smaller company and helping the stock go up 12% in one day.

These are companies i've had my eye on for some time now and believe that now that they've kind of been in the red lately, this means we could see upward motion with them soon, possibly this week. I know they aren’t very related but I just felt like talking about what moderate to high risk stocks i'm interested in as of now. Also this is not financial advice.

6,NVDA,BioAtla to $10-$20 🚀🚀🚀,"This is my first post on here so let me give my thesis.

Phase 3 trials typically require a lot of funding (Ranging from tens of millions to hundreds of millions). I believe this company will be bought out specifically for the Ozuriftamab (Oz-V) cancer drug and its safety profile and efficacy.

Who would buy the company? You may ask yourself this, and the 3 potential companies I see that would buy it would be: Pfizer, Bristol-Myers, and Merck &amp; Co.

The fact of matter is: all it takes is 100,000 people on here to put $10,000. Which also means, only 10,000 people putting $100,000. And if you’re already loaded, load up, because only 1,000 people would need to put $1,000,000 in order for the stock price to reach $20. (The market cap is only $51 million)

I currently own 8,018 shares and to show more commitment I am planning to add another $6,700 to buy more shares. This would give me a total of ~15,400 shares of stock. I still have another $2,000 if I feel extra ballsy.

Nov. 17, 2025 – Nov. 21, 2025","First of all, I don't want to be misunderstood. This heat map is weekly that it visualized via closing prices from November 14 to November 21.

This week, our agenda had 3 main topics: Nvidia's results, Fed rate cut expectations, and tariffs. Tariff pressures decreased compare to recent weeks, but it's still on the table.

📊 Here are the S&amp;P 500's week-by-week results for the last 4 week,

October 24 close at 6,791.69 - October 31 close at 6,840.20 🟢 (+0.71%)

October 31 close at 6,840.20 - November 7 close at 6,728.81 🔴 (-1.63%)

November 7 close at 6,728.81 - November 14 close at 6,734.11 🟢 (+0.08%)

November 14 close at 6,734.11 - November 21 close at 6,602.96 🔴 (-1.95%)

🔸 Monday: After the last two negative days of the previous week, the stock market opened in same path and lower. The economical datas had started from this week. The main focus is Nvidia's result that came after the session of Wednesday's. The flight operations returned to normal. Warren Buffett released his portfolio and revealed $4.9B Google stake, and Google gained more than 3% at the close. It was a bad day. The stock market closed lower more than 1%. The Nasdaq led. 🔴

🔸 Tuesday: The government was closed for 43 days and a lot of data could not be released. Before the session, Jobless Claims for the week ended October 18 were released on the government website at 232K. Meanwhile, Trump said we want 1% inflation. The stock market opened lower again. Fed's Barkin said he agrees with Powell that a December interest rate cut is not a foregone conclusion. Trump also said he has chosen next Fed chair. The stock market closed lower and extended losing streak to 4-day. Gold drooped and jumped $4,000 again. 🔴

🔸 Wednesday: The big day of the week arrived. Nvidia's result had released after the session. Bessent said Trump to decide on the next Federal Reserve Chair before Christmas. The stock market opened higher after 4-day losing streak. During the session, Fed minutes were released and shows that several participants were against rate cut. The stock market closed higher. 🟢

🔸 Thursday: Nvidia released results and Q4 revenue outlook topped estimates. The stock gained more than 5% in the futures market. U.S. continuing jobless claims rise to 1.974M and it's highest since November 2021. The stock market opened higher more than 1%, but it could not hold gains and closed lower more than 1.5% in final hour. The S&amp;P 500 closed at the support around 6,500. It's lowest level since October 14. Nvidia closed lower more than 3%. It has high volatility from 5% to -3%. Gold held steady, but silver crashed. 🔴

🔸 Friday: Trump removed 40% tariff on Brazilian beef and coffee. Fed's Williams said that we don't have insights on whether market overvalued. He also said support for rate cut. The stock market opened higher after Thursday's heavy selling. Michigan 1-Year Inflation Expectations came at 4.5%. It was 4.7% in previous month. The stock market closed higher on renewed rate cut hopes. The S&amp;P 500 gained 1%. 🟢

Nvidia's result was strong. The investors preferred to bull side in futures market, but during the session, it turned to opposite. Rate cut expectations remains uncertain. During the week, The possibility of 25 point rate cut fell below 50% on The CME FedWatch tool, but now it's up to 71%. It was tough week. The S&amp;P 500 dropped 1.95% and it's biggest lost since the week of October 5. It seems that volatility will continue until the Fed rate cut decision. Overall, I'm still optimistic side especially Nasdaq.

What do you think? What do you think? How was your week?

13,NVDA,We are not in AI bubble,"The price of RAM has nearly tripled in just two months, and Nvidia cannot produce enough GPUs to satisfy the massive demand coming from the biggest technology companies. Yet people still talk about the possibility of an artificial intelligence bubble, as if the world is overflowing with unused hardware and companies are just throwing money for fun. The reality is the exact opposite. We are literally running out of the physical components required to support the current wave of artificial intelligence development. Every part of the supply chain is under intense pressure, from memory manufacturers to chip foundries to the companies assembling high performance servers.

254,NVDA,Google says AI demand forcing 2x capacity growth every 6 months as it targets 1000x scale in 5 years,"No paywall: [https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/11/google-tells-employees-it-must-double-capacity-every-6-months-to-meet-ai-demand/](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/11/google-tells-employees-it-must-double-capacity-every-6-months-to-meet-ai-demand/)

&gt;While AI bubble talk fills the air these days, with fears of overinvestment that could pop at any time, something of a contradiction is brewing on the ground: Companies like Google and OpenAI can barely build infrastructure fast enough to fill their AI needs.

&gt;During an all-hands meeting earlier this month, Google’s AI infrastructure head Amin Vahdat told employees that the company must double its serving capacity every six months to meet demand for artificial intelligence services, reports CNBC. The comments show a rare look at what Google executives are telling its own employees internally. Vahdat, a vice president at Google Cloud, presented slides to its employees showing the company needs to scale “the next 1000x in 4-5 years.”

&gt;While a thousandfold increase in compute capacity sounds ambitious by itself, Vahdat noted some key constraints: Google needs to be able to deliver this increase in capability, compute, and storage networking “for essentially the same cost and increasingly, the same power, the same energy level,” he told employees during the meeting. “It won’t be easy but through collaboration and co-design, we’re going to get there.”

&gt;It’s unclear how much of this “demand” Google mentioned represents organic user interest in AI capabilities versus the company integrating AI features into existing services like Search, Gmail, and Workspace. But whether users are using the features voluntarily or not, Google isn’t the only tech company struggling to keep up with a growing user base of customers using AI services.

&gt;Major tech companies are in a race to build out data centers. Google competitor OpenAI is planning to build six massive data centers across the US through its Stargate partnership project with SoftBank and Oracle, committing over $400 billion in the next three years to reach nearly 7 gigawatts of capacity. The company faces similar constraints serving its 800 million weekly ChatGPT users, with even paid subscribers regularly hitting usage limits for features like video synthesis and simulated reasoning models.

&gt;“The competition in AI infrastructure is the most critical and also the most expensive part of the AI race,” Vahdat said at the meeting, according to CNBC’s viewing of the presentation. The infrastructure executive explained that Google’s challenge goes beyond simply outspending competitors. “We’re going to spend a lot,” he said, but noted the real objective is building infrastructure that is “more reliable, more performant and more scalable than what’s available anywhere else.”

&gt;The thousandfold scaling challenge

&gt;One major bottleneck for meeting AI demand has been Nvidia’s lack of capacity to produce enough GPUs that accelerate AI computations. Just a few days ago during a quarterly earnings report, Nvidia said its AI chips are “sold out” as it races to meet demand that grew its data center revenue by $10 billion in a single quarter.

&gt;The lack of chips and other infrastructure constraints affects Google’s ability to deploy new AI features. During the all-hands meeting on November 6, Google CEO Sundar Pichai cited the example of Veo, Google’s video generation tool that received an upgrade last month. “When Veo launched, how exciting it was,” Pichai said. “If we could’ve given it to more people in the Gemini app, I think we would have gotten more users but we just couldn’t because we are at a compute constraint.”

&gt;At the same meeting, Vahdat’s presentation outlined how Google plans to achieve its massive scaling targets without simply throwing money at the problem. The company plans to rely on three main strategies: building physical infrastructure, developing more efficient AI models, and designing custom silicon chips.

&gt;Using its own chips means Google does not need to completely rely on Nvidia hardware to build out its AI capabilities. Earlier this month, for example, Google announced the general availability of its seventh-generation Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) called Ironwood. Google claims it is “nearly 30x more power efficient” than its first Cloud TPU from 2018.

&gt;Given widespread acknowledgment of a potential AI industry bubble, including extended remarks by Pichai in a recent BBC interview, the aggressive plans for AI data center expansion reflect Google’s calculation that the risk of underinvesting exceeds the risk of overcapacity. But it’s a bet that could prove costly if demand doesn’t continue to increase as expected.

&gt;At the all-hands meeting, Pichai told employees that 2026 will be “intense,” citing both AI competition and pressure to meet cloud and compute demand. Pichai directly addressed employee concerns about a potential AI bubble, acknowledging the topic has been “definitely in the zeitgeist.”",2876,610,1763847802.0,2025-11-22T21:43:22+00:00,t3_1p4532c,wallstreetbets

9,NVDA,"Wanted to write a DD, but now it's public: Intel to Secure Microsoft, Tesla, Qualcomm &amp; NVIDIA as Advanced Packaging Customers in the U.S.","One of the things that I wanted to mention in ""my last DD"" on INTC was that they have advanced 3D packaging technology, meaning they can put together different nodes into one chip - giving them an edge when it comes to combining ""the best of the best"". And how Lip-Bu Tan will use it to push INTC foundry business further

It looks like it's now going to become a reality.

I ofc. loaded up on more INTC Leaps during this bearish market, hope you fellas did too.

I might mention one more thing here a wild speculation:

Lip-Bu Tan is on the board of a company called ""AnnapurnaLabs"" an Israeli startup building AI chips, acquired by Amazon. Trainiums and Gravitons are ARM based chips produced by this company and there was a deal (closed by Pat Gelsinger in late 2024) that we didn't hear about for a long time. Amazon did mention something about upgrading their current lineup the same time more rumors about AI clients surfaced in mid 2025.

Could be pure wild speculation, but maybe they've decided to take advantage of the **improved voltage droop from 18A tech**, since they keep mentioning how the new lineup is more power efficient. Voltage droop is especially important for inference chips, fingers crossed.

Other than that we might see Maia II in '26 which is currently speculated to be produced fully with 18A tech.

To those people who kept asking about yield of the new fabs - it's improving by 7% each month.

I'm looking at some nice greens during this otherwise bearish market.

Lastly to the people still doubting Intel's power. Keep in mind that AMD has gained nothing from the data center market. Looking at their numbers they at best sold 1.5BLN worth of CPUs (they on purpose don't distinguish between GPU and CPU data center sales, however given the fact that it's 2:1 in price it's safe to say CPU is close to 1.5BLN) - compared to INTC 4.5BLN datacenter CPU sales.

Demand for AMD GPU/CPUs is low, Amazon itself reported this some time ago:  
[https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amazon-amzn-says-it-not-seeing-enough-demand-amds-ai-chips](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amazon-amzn-says-it-not-seeing-enough-demand-amds-ai-chips)

AMD CPUs are only sold with AMD GPUs, that's how they get their CPU sales. Datacenters always prefered Intel over AMD due to superior software and hardware support, the new Amazon 1GW Datacenter is a prime example of that.

AMD GPUs are not in demand, because unlike NVDA - no academic mind knows how to use it properly, the software support is shit and NVDA spent close to 20 years spoon feeding academics with CUDA. They are only competing with other inference chips:  
\- AMZN - Trainium  
\- GOOG - TPU  
\- MSFT - Maia II  
\- Honorable mentions: Qualcomm, INTC, etc.

The only demand for AMD GPUs is from a deal with OpenAI that is entirely dependent on AMD stock price being in the highs. Those who know me, know that I bought AMD puts and keep on buying them until AMD is trading at 160.

Entire blockchain DEFI ecosystem is built on TEEs from Intel (usually SGX, but are switching to TDX). AMD is not trusted in the cybersecurity domain and probably never will be. Intel is always going to dominate. So any banking / DEFI system built in cloud using TEEs is built with Intel.

There's a lot more that I could mention, but no point in doing so. People who understand the semiconductor industry will see that INTC is here to shine and thrive.

Lastly according to the CFO the foundry business is expected to be breakeven by 2027, however given Lip-Bu Tan's philosophy on ""underpromise, overdeliver"" I wouldn't be surprised if they were breakeven sooner.

**Note: IBKR is down for maintenance but once it's back up I will post my updated position.

10,NVDA,NVDA Chip Obsolescence,"One of the talking points in the argument that we are in an AI bubble is that NVDA chips supposedly have a shorter useful life than NVDA claims.  I don’t understand this argument.  Even assuming that NVDA chips have a shorter useful life, why would that signal an AI bubble?  Wouldn’t the fact that NVDA is turning out faster and more economical chips that make older chips obsolete mean that NVDA will have a greatly extended period of high demand for its next generation of chips?  And on the buy side, wouldn’t the fact that new chips coming out are better and cheaper argue for expansion of the market for so services (services doing more and costing less)?

I can see a problem for an overleveraged data center that doesn’t have cash flow to meet debt service and upgrade — but isn’t that a limited problem and not an indication of a bubble?

Can anyone explain why chip obsolescence is supposed to be a sign that the AI trade is at risk?

11,NVDA,Eli Lilly becomes the first pharma to hit a 1 trillion dollar market cap on booming weight loss drug demand.

&gt;Eli Lilly (LLY) became the first health care company to top $1 trillion in market capitalization on Friday, joining an exclusive club that includes big tech names like Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL) and [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com) (AMZN).

&gt;Shares rose as high at 1,061.17 in early action, tipping Lilly's market cap just north of $1 trillion for the first time. Eli Lilly stock closed 2% higher at 1,059.70, keeping its market cap in the 13-digit club.

&gt;According to CNBC, Lilly is the second non-tech name to reach the $1 trillion club in the U.S., following Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB).

&gt;Eli Lilly Stock's Comeback

&gt;Eli Lilly shares are making an impressive comeback, rising 35% this year after the drugmaker inked a deal with the Trump administration to sell its weight-loss drug, Zepbound, for a lower price on the new direct-to-consumer website, TrumpRx. The deal also includes a provision for Eli Lilly to sell Zepbound and Mounjaro, its diabetes powerhouse, to Medicare at a significant discount.

&gt;Rather than hurt Lilly's top line, experts say the move will expand the market, adding new patients who couldn't otherwise afford the popular drugs.

&gt;""The market penetration of these drugs in weight loss is still fairly low, and in diabetes, where it's higher, it's still low,"" Brad Stewart, an executive with the advisory firm BDO, recently told Investor's Business Daily. ""There's still a tremendous opportunity from growth just purely from additional patients.""

&gt;Lilly Shares Hit A Record High

&gt;Lilly stock has a perfect IBD Digital Composite Rating of 99. The 1-99 score pits a stock's fundamental and technical measures against all other stocks. On this measure, Eli Lilly stock outranks 99% of stocks, regardless of industry group.

&gt;Shares broke out of a lengthy consolidation with a buy point at 972.53. That entry represents the stock's previous record high, dating back to August 2024. Lilly stock has since blown well past that mark. The stock is now about 8% above its entry, north of the buy zone.

&gt;The strength is represented in Eli Lilly stock's 93 Relative Strength Rating, a measure of a stock's 12-month performance relative to all other stocks. Shares also have a nearly perfect EPS Rating of 98, meaning earnings growth is in the top 2% echelon of companies.",408,117,1763828682.0,2025-11-22T16:24:42+00:00,t3_1p3xc39,wallstreetbets

264,NVDA,Nebius analogies - long term vision,"DISCLAIMER: I am invested in Nebius Group and thought of sharing this since it's a popular name among retails. Feel free to discuss, debate, argue, critic and or share any thoughts on this post below. Looking forward to healthy and useful discussions!

There you go:

I saw questions recently as to how Nebius can stay relevant once the market stops running on shortage economics and how do they plan to compete down the road against the already established cloud giants/hyperscalers.

To understand this I thought I'd share some analogies with companies that entered crowded markets against much bigger players and still built long term dominance. Nvidia and Snowflake are the closest analogies I thought of because both built a focused architecture around one workload and pushed that specialization far enough that big incumbents could not copy it without tearing apart their own designs.

Nvidia is the strongest comparison. Nvidia entered a compute market dominated by Intel and AMD. Those companies had more capital, more manufacturing reach and more distribution. Nvidia broke out because it committed early to parallel compute and built every layer of the stack around that model. Hardware, drivers, libraries, compilers. Everything moved in one direction. When parallel workloads exploded in importance Nvidia was already years ahead. The gap widened because the layers reinforced each other. That became a durable advantage because integrated systems are hard to imitate after the fact. Vertical integration of offerings has a compounding advantage over time.

Nebius is similar in structure. It is building an AI cloud with tight control over physical infrastructure and the software that manages it. The focus is not general purpose compute but large GPU clusters. They design and operate their own data centers, tune power density and cooling for high GPU concentration, run networking built for fast east-west traffic, and orchestrate clusters specifically for AI training and inference. The orchestration and software stack is tightly integrated with the hardware, handling GPU allocation, containerized workloads, job scheduling, monitoring, and operational governance. Many specialized neo-cloud players rely on generic Kubernetes or adapted open source orchestration tools. Their software layer is absent or less integrated with the physical infrastructure, which limits efficiency and operational stickiness. Nebius’ software layer is designed to reduce idle time, improve throughput, and provide predictable SLAs, which creates both a cost advantage and a structural moat against these specialized competitors. Hyperscalers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud cannot replicate this fully because their stacks must support multi-purpose workloads, which creates overhead and reduces performance for highly optimized AI clusters.

A core difference to note here is that Nvidia controlled the silicon, while Nebius operates above the silicon. This means GPU supply and hardware pricing are partially outside their control. The analogy still holds because Nebius is pursuing vertical integration in the layers it can control. The full stack integration from hardware to orchestration is what gives Nebius a structural advantage similar to Nvidia’s in parallel compute.

Snowflake is the second analogy. When Snowflake started, AWS and Google already ran major data warehouses. Snowflake won because it built the warehouse around a clean separation of compute and storage. That made performance predictable, operations simple, and costs transparent. Snowflake focused entirely on one workload and executed better than incumbents. Nebius is following a similar approach. It focuses on AI compute and designs its cloud around that workload alone. High density servers, efficient cooling, fast networking, integrated orchestration, and predictable performance for inference and training. Hyperscalers offer AI compute, but in general-purpose clouds with overhead that reduces cost efficiency and predictability. Nebius offers a cleaner, more optimized experience for the workload that matters most. Over time, this could be the wedge to expand into larger AI operations and platform offerings, much like Snowflake expanded from the warehouse into a data cloud.

Nebius' has many advantages today. Control over physical infrastructure provides predictable cluster performance and better density. The integrated software stack manages GPU allocation, scheduling, monitoring, and governance in a way that specialized players cannot match. Multi-year anchor contracts with large enterprise and cloud customers reduce revenue volatility and create predictable scale. Optimized networking and hardware selection lower operational costs per unit of compute. These advantages are durable against specialized players because those companies either lease capacity or rely on less integrated software stacks. Against hyperscalers, Nebius’ advantage is performance and cost efficiency for large AI workloads where hyperscalers carry general-purpose overhead.

Long term durability depends on executing the strategy consistently. The company must continue to scale infrastructure efficiently, keep its software stack tightly integrated, and maintain operational excellence. The structural advantage is that AI workloads continue to demand larger, denser, and faster clusters, which favors a provider like Nebius. If workloads fragment toward smaller clusters or hyperscalers significantly optimize their AI offerings, the advantage could shrink, but currently the architecture and focus give Nebius a defensible position.

Nebius’ strategy for building and retaining clients involves three things. First, securing multi-year contracts and mega deals that give predictable capacity and operational guarantees. This ensures high stickiness and integrates clients into their platform rather than treating them as spot capacity buyers. Second, productization of AI inference through Token Factory, which simplifies usage, provides governance, and locks in operational workflows. Third, continuous software development to improve cluster efficiency, operational visibility, and integration with customer model pipelines, which increases switching costs and embeds Nebius deeply into client AI operations. This strategy targets large enterprises, AI research labs, and model-driven companies that require predictable performance and governance controls.

Market positioning over the next five to ten years involves competing simultaneously on multiple fronts. Specialized players will most likely compete on price and service flexibility. Nebius competes by offering superior integration, operational efficiency, low cost, high flexibility and a more complete and vertically integrated stack. Hyperscalers like AWS, Azure, and Google compete on breadth, global scale, and brand trust. Nebius competes by providing a more efficient, predictable, flexible and governance-friendly alternative for the heaviest AI workloads. Some hyperscalers may become clients for excess capacity or specialized workloads, creating a mixed relationship of competition and partnership.

Vertical integration is a common strategy in cloud, compute, SaaS and other industries because controlling all or most of the infrastructure, software and integrations makes it expensive and complex for clients to switch providers down the road. When clients build their projects deeply on a provider’s stack, moving to a competitor requires redoing infrastructure, workflows, and integrations, which raises switching costs and keeps clients locked in. For Nebius, scaling fast and acquiring clients now is crucial because the sooner clients adopt and build deeply on their vertically integrated stack, the higher the switching costs become. Early embedding into projects locks in clients, creates long-term retention, and will allow Nebius to leverage its integration advantage before competitors like hyperscalers can influence those clients. Nebius is likely to retain clients primarily because of the quality of its offerings and service, but its vertical integration also strengthens retention vs competitors that lack full integration, amplifying the advantage of early adoption and deep embedding in their stack.

Any high-potential business with a strong story still needs execution and innovation to succeed in a competitive market. I don’t see Nebius becoming commoditized even if supply eventually meets or exceeds demand because it offers far more than raw compute and bare-metal data centers. It differentiates itself across performance, services, and ecosystem integration rather than competing on price alone. I trust the Nebius team to execute and innovate, widening the gap versus competitors through the compounding advantage of vertical integration. The quality of the management and engineering team is a key reason I invested in the company.

This post is not about the well-known risks. It focuses on Nebius’ current market position, long-term vision, business model viability, and how they plan to compete against larger players in the future.",99,47,1763820327.0,2025-11-22T14:05:27+00:00,t3_1p3u1iw,stocks

&gt; Nov 21 (Reuters) - The Trump administration is considering greenlighting sales of Nvidia's H200 artificial intelligence chips to China, people familiar with the matter said, as a bilateral detente boosts prospects for exports of advanced U.S. technology to China.

&gt; The Commerce Department, which oversees U.S. export controls, is reviewing a change to its policy of barring sales of such chips to China, the sources said, stressing that plans could change.

&gt; A White House official declined to comment but said, ""The administration is committed to securing America's global technology leadership and safeguarding our national security."" The Commerce Department did not respond to a request for comment. Nvidia did not comment directly on the review but said current regulation does not allow the company to offer a competitive AI data center chip in China, leaving that massive market to its rapidly growing foreign competitors.

&gt; The possibility signals a friendlier approach to China, after U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping brokered a trade and tech war truce in Busan last month.",65,45,1763767929.0,2025-11-21T23:32:09+00:00,t3_1p3dxep,stocks
15,NVDA,"[Fortune] Nvidia CEO says the company is in a no-win situation amid AI-bubble chatter, leaked meeting reveals","&gt;Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told employees this week that the company has been pushed into a no-win situation by mounting fears of an AI bubble, even as it continues to post blockbuster results, according to audio of an internal all-hands meeting reviewed by Business Insider.
&gt;
&gt;“The market did not appreciate our incredible quarter,” Huang said on Thursday, less than 24 hours after Nvidia reported another set of record earnings and said it had “visibility” into half a trillion dollars of revenue lined up for the rest of 2025 and 2026.
&gt;
&gt;Instead of rewarding the beat, investors delivered a shocking reversal that saw shares briefly rising Thursday before turning lower, dragging down the broader AI trade by the end of the session.
&gt;
&gt;Huang said expectations around Nvidia have become so extreme that Wall Street now sees danger in both directions.
&gt;
&gt;“If we delivered a bad quarter, it is evidence there’s an AI bubble. If we delivered a great quarter, we are fueling the AI bubble,” he told employees. “If we were off by just a hair, if it looked even a little bit creaky, the whole world would’ve fallen apart.”
&gt;
&gt;The comments offer a rare glimpse into how the face of the AI boom views the growing backlash to it, and how closely he is watching the market’s whiplash response.
&gt;A blowout quarter that spooked investors
&gt;
&gt;On paper, Nvidia gave investors about everything they had asked for. The chipmaker reported another surge in sales of its data-center processors, the workhorses that power large AI models (and Nvidia’s revenues), and raised its guidance for the current quarter. It was the kind of performance expected to kick off another six-month rally, investors were saying. 
&gt;
&gt;Instead, the stock’s initial jump gave way to a broad selloff. Nvidia climbed as much as 5% early in Thursday’s session before closing down roughly 3%, as traders rotated out of the Big Tech names most closely associated with the AI boom. 
&gt;
&gt;The reversal extended what has become a bruising stretch for the so-called AI trade. After months of a breathless rally, investors are increasingly anxious that tech giants are spending too aggressively on data centers, GPUs, and networking gear, with no guarantee they can earn enough revenue to get those investments back. Some are also focusing on the complex, debt-heavy financing structures behind the AI infrastructure build-out, with credit markets starting to flash early warning signs.
&gt;
&gt;Layered on top of that are fresh macro jitters. A shutdown-delayed U.S. jobs report, released the same morning, showed stronger-than-expected hiring in September, but a higher unemployment rate; this conflicting data did little to clarify whether the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in December.
&gt;
&gt;Some investors are closely watching different statements from Fed presidents to try to read the tea leaves, but with the earnings season winding down and no obvious catalyst between now and the Fed’s next decision, it appears that many other investors are using the volatility to lock in profits from the year’s earlier rally—and get out of the market.
&gt;
&gt;“The broader narrative hasn’t broken; it’s simply being tested right now,” Mark Hackett at Nationwide told Bloomberg. “Periods like this often act as a release valve rather than signaling a true trend reversal. 
&gt;‘We’re basically holding the planet together‘
&gt;
&gt;Inside Nvidia, Huang suggested no one should be surprised that investors are jumpy when so much of the AI story is being projected onto a single company.
&gt;
&gt;He referenced online memes that jokingly describe Nvidia as the linchpin of the global economy and **the only thing standing between the U.S. and recession**.
&gt;
&gt;“Have you guys seen some of them?” he asked employees. “We’re basically holding the planet together—and it’s not untrue.”
&gt;
&gt;That level of mythos has helped propel Nvidia’s market value into the stratosphere, making it the world’s most valuable public company. But Huang made clear that it has also turned every earnings day into a high-wire act.
&gt;
&gt;“The expectations are so high that if we miss by just a little bit, people think the whole story is broken,” he said.
&gt;
&gt;Still, Huang pushed back on the idea that Nvidia is responsible for the frothier parts of the AI trade. The company’s job, he emphasized, is to build the compute infrastructure others need, not to police how the market prices demand.
&gt;
&gt;Amidst the pressure, Huang kept the meeting light with whistling-past-the-graveyard-esqe humor about Nvidia’s wild swings.
&gt;
&gt;He joked about the “good old days” when the company had a $5 trillion market capitalization, a playful exaggeration of its actual peak valuation—before noting just how much value has evaporated in recent weeks.
&gt;
&gt;“Nobody in history has ever lost $500 billion in a few weeks,” he said. “You’ve got to be worth a lot to lose $500 billion in a few weeks.”
&gt;
&gt;Huang told employees he was “delighted” by the quarter and proud of their work, stressing the company’s underlying business remains strong even if markets are punishing them for it.",2074,212,1763767514.0,2025-11-21T23:25:14+00:00,t3_1p3drri,StockMarket

13,NVDA,Anatomy of a tenbagger: why the Red Queen hypothesis will help you find the next NVDA. AMPX DD,"Given everyone is bearish around here and is butthurt about seeing their positions crater over the last month, let me try and inject some good old fashioned DD so you can fantasize about future gains again. This will be a long one as I’ve been following this company for quite a while and done a fair amount of research on the sector. Writing to share but also looking for feedback from anyone who has been on the front lines. (If you fly drones for the army please hit me up) Here we go:

The Red Queen Hypothesis and Unfair Advantages

I used to work as an engineer in a highly competitive (but also technical) sport. It’s where I witnessed how powerful the Red Queen hypothesis is. In evolutionary biology, the Red Queen hypothesis proposes that organisms must constantly adapt and evolve just to maintain their current fitness in a rapidly changing environment. In sport, this means that every new piece of equipment that confers an advantage eventually becomes table stakes. In business, the metaphor fits companies that offer a technology to a hyper-competitive industry that is seen as an “unfair advantage”. Those that don’t adopt fast enough get left behind. Ten baggers are the companies that create and embed an advantage so powerful that their technology becomes necessary rather than optional for survival in the competitive arena.

Think about NVDA and the AI arms race:

A company builds a technology that rivals cannot easily replicate and that customers must adopt to keep up.

Over time, keeping up becomes, in effect, the bare minimum and those who lag pay a price (either margin pressure, share loss or extinction).

The industry’s motion forces everyone to “run faster” just to stay in place; the “winner” runs ahead and thus outpaces everyone else, like the Red Queen’s race.

For shareholders, this dynamic can produce sustained growth, margin expansion and ultimately multi-bag returns when the market begins to price in the inevitability of dominance.

To use this as a filter for finding a potential “next NVDA,” one should ask:

Is the company offering a true step-change technological advantage?

Is the advantage serving a high-stakes, high-volume industry where the cost of not adopting is meaningful?

Are there structural tailwinds (regulatory, geopolitical, market) that make adoption likely and widespread?

Are there barriers to entry (patents, manufacturing scale, regulatory approvals, systems integration)?

Can the company transition from early-proof to scale production to cash-flow positive?

When these align, the company and its products shift from nice to have must have, and if you can time the inflection, the upside can be dramatic.


Why I think this is where AMPX (Amprius Technologies, Inc.) and the Drone Market stand today

Let’s walk through how AMPX fits this Red Queen model, focusing on the drone / unmanned aerial systems (UAS) sector, which is undergoing a structural shift.

Unfair advantage: high-energy-density silicon-anode batteries
Amprius has developed silicon-anode lithium-ion cells (its SiCore® platform) that deliver very high energy density (cited at ~450 Wh/kg) and are shipping to drone / UAS customers.   The advantage: for drones, endurance, power-to-weight ratio, reliability in demanding environments all matter. A battery that lets a drone fly longer, carry more, or operate in harsher conditions becomes a competitive differentiator.

To give you a practical sense of how much of an advantage these batteries are: Nordic Wing (a recently announced customer) claimed that these batteries increased flight time by 90%. Nearly double. If you’ve ever flown a drone: flight time is a major limitation and a doubling is an unfair advantage.

The thesis: If military/commercial drone OEMs adopt Amprius’ cells as a required component to stay competitive (i.e., “we must use this battery tech or our drone cannot keep up”), then Amprius may be in a position to become a “must-supplier” in a fast-moving industry.

Industry: drones / defence procurement is entering a leap

Lots has been written about drones on WSB so I won’t go too deep into the industry details. I would only go into one headline that you may have missed because you were too busy mourning your ports:

The United States Army recently announced that it is targeting procurement of at least one million drones over the next 2-3 years compared to its current rate of ~50 000/year.  This is not the “10-20% CAGR” that analysts have been modeling. This is a tenfold increase. 

The drone industry is not just growing, but entering a step-change in scale and procurement behaviour. In such environments, component suppliers that supply the “secret sauce” tech (like high-density batteries) can benefit disproportionately.

Fit: Amprius meets the criteria
AMPX is shipping cells to advanced drone customers and already qualified some of its modules for leading defense tech.

The company claims partnerships and orders from UAS manufacturers (e.g., a recent ~$35 million follow-on purchase order from a drone customer).  

The tech has meaningful performance claims (450 Wh/kg, long-endurance drones) that allow drone makers to differentiate.  

The addressable market is large and rising, and procurement cycles are shifting from “nice” to “need.”

Because the advantage is embedded in a complex hardware component (battery chemistry + manufacturing scale + safety + certification) it is harder to replicate quickly.

Where the “Red Queen” effect kicks in
Drone OEMs and militaries are under pressure: adversaries are using expendable drones, swarms, long-duration UAS, etc. To keep up, incumbents must adopt superior batteries, sensors, autonomy, etc. Amprius’ tech thus becomes not just a bonus, but potentially part of the minimum standard to compete. That means the company might avoid being just another supplier and instead become a foundational supplier: giving it leverage on pricing, margins and volume.

If the transition from “prototype” to “volume orders” happens (and Amprius seems to be making that move), then the stock might see the kind of multi-bag move one hopes for when the market re-rates based on future dominance.

BuT tHe sToCK Is AlrEAdY uP:

Yes, yes, the stock has run. I actually tried to post about it late last year but it was under the allowable market cap. This is a real company: and real companies can continue to go up if earnings back it up. Here are some numbers to back valuations:

Q3 2025 (ended Sept 30) revenue: $21m. EPS of –$0.03 vs –$0.06 estimate.  

Growth: This was a ~42% quarter-on-quarter increase and ~173% year-over-year (for the quarter)
Gross margin: The company has reported a positive gross margin ( +15% in Q3) that is expected to expand 
Orders/customers: A ~$35 million order from a recurring drone customer.  80 customers added in Q3 and $53m in backlog orders.

Production capacity: The firm has stated ~1.8 gigawatt hours of capacity through partners.  This translates to $1-2B of revenue at full capacity. 

Conservative profitability scenario:
Let’s assume the following:

Revenue for full year 2026 grows, not exponentially, but moderately (say ~100% vs 2025). If 2025 full-year revenue ends up around ~$75m (given Q1-Q3 numbers and ramp), then 2026 might hit ~$140-200m in revenue.
At say a 15% gross margin (which is already achieved  and is expected to expand), and modest operating expense growth, the company could move from net loss to near breakeven or modest profit. In Q1 or Q2 2026.

Given the order backlog and ramp in drone battery shipments, the margin expansion may happen without assuming extraordinary growth.

In other words: if the market begins to believe that Amprius can deliver $150m+ revenue with 15%+ gross margin, then the path to profitability seems credible and that tends to shift the valuation multiple upward (especially for a “must-supplier” in a fast growth market). Even if the company is not free-cash-flow positive today, the market will begin to treat it as more than an R&amp;D story.  

Risks: standard and obvious. Company is not profitable yet. (It has also been stuck in a momentum basket which has made it quite volatile, though it seems to be losing tracking now)

Summary &amp; PT

Without getting too deep into the numbers: having been on earnings calls and seen analyst PTs and modeling a small increase in growth, my 2026 PT is $25. (This is a tenbagger from when I first got in, sorry) though I’ve added at $7 and again at $11. There is no reason, should they continue to execute, that AMPX can’t be a 5-10B company.

Position attached plus another 2k shares in an account I can’t see online (you’ll have to take my word for it)

Putting it all together: The Red Queen lens tells us: look for companies whose advantage becomes a baseline “must have” in a fast-moving market.

Amprius appears to fit: high-density silicon-anode batteries, serving drone/UAS manufacturers in an environment where drones are rapidly becoming indispensable.

Macro tailwinds are strong: military procurement of drones is ramping (US Army, executive orders, etc), the global drone market is growing, domestic supply-chain shifts favour US-based component providers. Personally, on a macro level, I think monetary and fiscal policy will be pro-risk asset in the beginning of 2026 as well.

If the market begins to price in that Amprius will be the dominant supplier (or among the few key suppliers) to the drone industry, then the valuation upside could be meaningful. The key is timing the inflection from “growth story” to “earnings story” once profitability (or credible path to profitability) is visible, the multiple expansion often follows.

Hang in there, and see you in Valhalla.

8,NVDA,AI bubble concerns continue to impact US stock market performance; Nvidia opened higher but closed lower.,"Today's US stock market performance wasn't what the bulls wanted. On what appeared to be a high-volume day, many stocks left an ugly candlestick on the charts. I've been arguing all week about a bubble in Nvidia, and the performance of Google's Gemini 3 further reinforces that argument. Google proved it can build incredibly large language models (LLMs) without Nvidia chips, meaning other companies can too, which will reduce Nvidia's (NVDA.O) profits. The problem is that Nvidia itself accounts for 8% of the S&amp;P 500, so halving the stock's value would directly cut 4 percentage points. Add to that all the other bubbles in the AI ​​sector, and there's a possibility of a shakeout. Another change in the past few weeks has been the Federal Reserve. Powell opposed a December rate cut, and the market has now priced it in from near certainty to just 36%. A less dovish Fed is never good for the market; it's a drag. In short, I'm not too worried about the Fed, but for AI, the situation is always ""a hair's breadth away.""",146,91,1763674209.0,2025-11-20T21:30:09+00:00,t3_1p2fqf7,stocks

9,NVDA,"Is the AI Bubble Already Popping? NVDA Looks Overpriced, and Google’s Just Proved It","Alright, let’s be real here.today’s price action in the market is exactly what bulls *didn't* want to see. On what seemed like a high-volume day, a lot of stocks left behind some ugly candlesticks on the charts.

I’ve been saying for a while now that NVIDIA (NVDA) has a bubble, and Google’s Gemini 3 just gave more fuel to that fire. Why? Well, Google showed that it can create impressive LLMs (large language models) without NVIDIA chips. If other companies can follow suit, it means less reliance on NVDA, and that directly impacts their profits.

Let’s not forget, NVIDIA is 8% of the S&amp;P 500, and if that stock gets cut in half, that’s a 4% drop off the index. We’re talking about some serious ripple effects. With all the AI bubbles floating around, I’m starting to wonder if this market’s about to get a nice little cleaning.

Another factor: The Fed. Powell came out swinging, saying he’s against a rate cut in December. The market was pricing in a nearly certain cut just weeks ago, and now it’s dropped to just 36%. A less dovish Fed is *never* good news for the market,it’s a drag on everything.

So yeah, I’m not too worried about the Fed, but AI? That’s always a fine line between bull market and bubble pop. Thoughts? Anyone else eyeing puts on NVDA or considering shorting AI stocks?",0,91,1763664598.0,2025-11-20T18:49:58+00:00,t3_1p2bhng,stocks

267,NVDA,White House Reportedly Urges Congress To Oppose China Chip Curbs,"White House’s lobbying against the GAIN AI Act was reported by Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter.  The act proposes that a company seeking a license to export advanced AI chips to China and other countries of concern first certify that American companies and startups have priority in acquiring those chips.

Trump’s backing of Huang and Nvidia is a no-brainer, given that the advanced, high-performance computing chips made by the company are used to power most of the AI applications, processes and systems. The president has also been using Nvidia’s AI processors as a bargaining chip in his negotiations with his major trading partners.

Nvidia opposed the bill in no uncertain terms. A company spokesperson reportedly said, “We never deprive American customers in order to serve the rest of the world. In trying to solve a problem that does not exist, the proposed bill would restrict competition worldwide in any industry that uses mainstream computing chips.”

NVDA beats handily and is propping up the entire market which is not sustainable in the long run

We were due for a bounce back after recent market declines and NVDA is being used as the catalyst, however this feels more like a head fake than anything more believable

19,NVDA,Michael Burry Says Nvidia Spent $112.5 Billion On Buybacks Adding 'Zero' Shareholder Value,"Famed “Big Short,” investor Michael Burry, known for his prescient bet against the housing market, has publicly questioned Nvidia Corp.‘s (NASDAQ:NVDA) capital allocation strategy, asserting that the tech giant’s $112.5 billion spent on stock buybacks since 2018 has effectively yielded “zero” additional shareholder value.

Nvidia's Massive Buybacks Added Zero Shareholder Value

In an X post, Burry dissected Nvidia’s financial data, highlighting a disconnect between aggressive share repurchases and the company’s rising share count. Burry’s analysis points to Nvidia’s $20.5 billion in Stock-Based Compensation (SBC) since 2018.

While the company reported a robust $205 billion in net income and $188 billion in free cash flow over the same period, Burry argues that the $112.5 billion dedicated to buybacks primarily served to offset stock-based compensation (SBC)-related dilution.

But it bought back $112.5B worth of stock and there are 47 million MORE shares outstanding,” Burry tweeted, adding, “The true cost of that SBC dilution was $112.5B, reducing owner's earnings by 50%.”

He suggests that the company's expenditures on buybacks were merely a defensive maneuver against dilution rather than a genuine reduction in outstanding shares.

This, he contends, fundamentally distorts the “owner’s earnings” perspective, presenting a less favorable picture for long-term investors.",5142,425,1763636602.0,2025-11-20T11:03:22+00:00,t3_1p20c9i,StockMarket

269,NVDA,Burry’s Recent Tweets: Week of Nvidia Q3 Earnings,"A simple explanation of what Michael Burry is warning about right now

During the week Nvidia reported its Q3 earnings, Michael Burry posted a series of tweets that pointed in one direction:
the current AI boom may not be supported by real, sustainable economic demand.

Below is a straightforward breakdown of what he said and why it matters.


---

1. The AI Money Loop Is Not Real Demand

Burry highlighted a chart showing the financial relationships between Nvidia, OpenAI, Microsoft, Oracle, AMD, CoreWeave, and many AI startups.

His point is simple:

AI companies are mostly buying from each other using money that came from each other.

Examples:

Microsoft invests in OpenAI

OpenAI spends billions on Nvidia chips

Nvidia invests in GPU-cloud companies

Those GPU-cloud companies buy more Nvidia chips

Oracle signs huge cloud deals with OpenAI

Oracle then buys large amounts of Nvidia hardware


This creates a circular economy where revenue appears to grow, but the money never comes from true end customers.

Burry summarized it as:

“True end demand is ridiculously small. Almost all customers are funded by their dealers.”

This means the AI industry could be inflating itself without real outside demand.


---

2. “Suspicious Revenue Recognition”

Burry warned that many AI companies may be using accounting methods that make their revenue look larger or more stable than it really is.

This can include:

Booking multi-year deals upfront

Using credits or internal agreements as revenue

Circular transactions where companies buy from each other


His view is that if every transaction were shown clearly, the financial picture would appear far less impressive.


---

3. Misunderstanding GPU Depreciation

Another tweet targeted the idea that older GPUs retaining high utilization means they retain high economic value.

Burry argued that:

Just because older chips are still being used does not mean they are profitable.

A100 GPUs use two to three times more electricity per compute unit than newer H100 chips.

Higher energy usage means drastically higher operating costs.


He compared it to airlines keeping old airplanes around only for holiday overflow. They still fly, but they don’t make meaningful profit.

Most importantly:
Many AI companies use GPUs as collateral for loans or SPV financing.
If the market realizes these chips are economically inefficient, their value collapses.


---

4. The 1969 Buffett Letter Comparison

Burry also posted Warren Buffett’s 1969 partnership-closing letter. In it, Buffett explained that markets were overpriced, speculation was rampant, and quality opportunities had vanished.

What followed:

The S&amp;P 500 fell sharply.

After inflation, investors lost more than half their purchasing power over the next decade.


Burry is implying that today’s AI-driven market resembles that overheated period.


---

5. Nvidia’s Buyback and Share Dilution Problem

Burry ended the week with a critique of Nvidia’s financial engineering.

From 2018 to 2025:

Nvidia earned about $205 billion in net income.

It generated $188 billion in free cash flow.

It spent $112.5 billion on stock buybacks.

Yet the total share count increased by 47 million shares.


This means the buybacks did not actually benefit shareholders.
They mainly offset dilution from stock-based compensation.

According to Burry, the real economic cost to shareholders was: $112.5 billion lost
and
owner earnings reduced by roughly half
because of how the compensation and buyback cycle worked.


---

Conclusion

Across all his tweets, Burry’s message is consistent:

AI demand is largely circular, not organic.

Revenue recognition practices may be hiding weakness.

GPU economics are misunderstood and potentially overstated.

The market resembles past speculative peaks.

Even Nvidia’s financials show signs of late-cycle strain.

260,NVDA,Why the “bubble” narrative is missing the point – prices aren’t actually that extreme,"
Bulls keep winning and bears keep getting wrecked for one simple reason: most bears are fighting the last war. They’re staring at 1999-style trailing P/E charts or pre-1990s valuation norms and declaring “this time is different” as if that’s automatically a bad thing. In reality, this time really is different – and the data backs it up.
Look at the Magnificent 7 specifically:
	•	Forward P/E ratios are surprisingly moderate given the growth rates we’re seeing
	•	PEG ratios (P/E divided by expected growth) are actually lower than they’ve been at many points in the past decade and significantly lower than the rest of the S&amp;P 493
We’re not paying 1999 multiples for 1999 growth – we’re paying reasonable (or even cheap) multiples for a completely different quality of business.
The core reason we’ll never return to pre-1990s valuation levels: the economy has shifted from tangible to intangible assets. Intellectual property, network effects, proprietary datasets, and software moats compound in ways steel mills and railroads never could. These assets get better and cheaper to scale every year instead of depreciating.
On AI specifically – the bear case that “AI won’t monetize” misses the bigger picture. Direct AI revenue might concentrate in a handful of players (Nvidia, the cloud hyperscalers, etc.), but the second-order effect is massive OPEX compression across every industry. Translation: companies will need far fewer employees to generate the same (or more) revenue.
You might lose your job… but the companies you own will be dramatically more profitable because of it. “You’ll own nothing, be replaced by a model, and be happy.”
Bears who keep waiting for a return to 15× earnings are going to be waiting a very long time. The game changed permanently sometime around the mid-90s and the laggards still haven’t adjusted their mental models.

17,NVDA,Trump’s New Post Gives NVIDIA a Boost,"Trump just shared a clip of NVIDIA’s Jensen Huang praising the U.S. for producing “the most advanced AI chips,” and crediting Trump’s tariffs and re-industrialization push. Pretty clear bullish tone for U.S. semiconductor manufacturing.

The post reads as a strong positive signal for **NVDA** on [truthtrade.club](http://truthtrade.club) looks like due to the following reasons:

* NVIDIA is directly tied to U.S. industrial policy benefits
* It positions the company as a winner in domestic chip production
* Pro-manufacturing + AI leadership generally boosts trader sentiment

Trump’s posts tend to move markets when they touch specific sectors — and this one hits all the usual catalysts:

* AI chips
* U.S. manufacturing
* Tariffs

24,NVDA,The Market is green because Nvidia can't miss the earning,"And so eveyrone thinks the end of market consolidation...

  
But, I guess everyone want to buy more and more and the earning of Nvidia is just a good reason to do it. I will be honest. Yesterday, everyone bought AI stock, and in pre market, all my AI stock are very green.

In the fact, we don't care about Nvidia earning, because we know they will beat earning very easily. This summer, they beat earning with China chipset ban while it's one of their biggest market with H20.

Today, we know the order book of Nvidia : 500 billions dollars. Their 3 big clients spend still their money to get more and more blackwell chipset. The independant hyperscaler builder like coreweave and nebius order more and more. They got some news products like Nvlink which got with their chipset rack, or the chipset for car. 

  
They are still getting more and more money. The real issue is the client : Amazon and Meta use bond to fund their AI development. Microsoft lost lot of money in Open AI and now, they want to make the same with Anthropic. That is the big red flag, that is what we must watch. 

They gonna sell the nvidia stock when these companies stop spending their money. Spoiler : they don't stop yet.",429,126,1763558172.0,2025-11-19T13:16:12+00:00,t3_1p17eog,StockMarket

🤏🏻After the 2008 financial crisis, gold's share gradually recovered, while the proportion of U.S. Treasury holdings (blue line) began declining from 2015, reflecting an accelerating trend of de-dollarization.

👌🏻By 2025, gold's share has nearly caught up with that of U.S. Treasuries, indicating that central banks are rebalancing their reserve strategies toward ""security and independence.""

276,NVDA,NVDA guesstimate!,"Trigger warning: people who have high value dependency on NVDA can stop reading as they may get triggered by this. 

TSMC stocks are a great precursor to what happens to NVDA. They beat market, stock price went up 7% after market and pre market but ended -1.7% during trading hours and then has since gone down 10% since then. NVDA usually follows suit!!

NVDA is expected to beat market and the stocks price have priced in such market beat. But unless it stuns current market expectations and their own projections by many fold for this quarter and gives a hugely positive guidance that will be way higher than market expectations and resets market growth, expect their stocks to behave similarly to TSMC.

25,NVDA,OpenAI vs. Anthropic projected cash flow and revenue,"From the WSJ, https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-anthropic-profitability-e9f5bcd6

&gt;The finances of Silicon Valley’s two largest artificial-intelligence startups show their diverging approaches to the AI boom, with Anthropic on a pace to turn a profit far more quickly than rival OpenAI, according to documents obtained by The Wall Street Journal.
&gt;
&gt;Anthropic, which has a growing number of business users because of the capabilities of its Claude chatbot in coding and other arenas, expects to break even for the first time in 2028, the documents show. 
&gt;
&gt;By contrast, OpenAI forecasts its operating losses that year to swell to about $74 billion—or roughly three-fourths of revenue—thanks to ballooning spending on computing costs. The ChatGPT-maker also expects to burn through roughly 14 times as much cash as Anthropic before turning a profit in 2030.

IMO, one telling thing is the investment history:

- Anthropic has huge investments from Amazon, Google, Nvidia, and Microsoft.
- OpenAI has investments from Microsoft, who got in early when OpenAI was at 5% of its current valuation. Since then, it's been a bunch of hedge funds and investment bankers like Softbank.

26,NVDA,NVIDIA Earnings - Macro Factor,"The markets lately show worries over the possibility of the AI trend ending due to not optimal economic conditions. The odds of a rate cut coming at the December Fed meeting, started the aggressive selling in the AI market

Due to these developments I tend to believe that data indicative for the general health of the economy, such as the jobs data Thursday, and Walmart's earnings, will be more important for NVIDIA's price than the actual earnings (that is, if earnings are not extremely good or bad).

Looking at reports from employers in various industries such as shipping/ freight, and the general economic trend, I believe the September jobs report will not be too good, but not necessarily bad either. A surprise to the upside could come from the leisure and hospitality sector, or health care and social assistance I guess, but I don't think it is enough to offset the losses in other sectors.

Would the mix of not so good jobs data + retailers signaling weakness raise the chances of a rate cut at the next Fed meeting? Or maybe the data is good enough to keep the chances for a rate cut low at the next meeting?

So far Im thinking NVDA calls expiring Friday 28th at 205 or 202.5

Heading into the graphic processing unit manufacturer’s third-quarter earnings, the investment firm reiterated its buy rating. Analyst Ruben Roy also raised his price target to 

# $250 from $212, which signals 34% upside.

  
Ahead of Nvidia’s earnings report, Roy increased his estimates for the stock. For the last quarter, the analyst expects a “moderate” beat, based on historical cadence. He also believes that the company will share “optimistic” guidance for its current quarter.

“CEO Jensen Huang’s recent keynote at GTC Washington D.C….outlined the company’s ongoing positioning as the backbone of AI infrastructure underpinned by more than $500bn in cumulative order book for Blackwell and Rubin infrastructure spanning 2025-2026,” he wrote. “With consensus (and our) expectations incorporating Mr. Huang’s commentary, expectations remain elevated.”

Roy added that consensus now backs up Nvidia’s claims to have around $350 billion in unsold order backlogs. Exiting 2025, the analyst sees Nvidia yielding an overall total addressable market of more than $100 billion, while in the longer term this opportunity could approach $1 trillion.

23,NVDA,Google this company if it’s the only advice you take on Reddit. CSAI,"Alright degenerates, analysts, and undercover hedge fund interns — buckle up.
I spent the last 72 hours down a CSAI rabbit hole and what I found is straight-up insane. This is one of the few microcaps where the story, numbers, catalysts, and insider moves actually line up.

Here’s why CSAI might be the most undervalued AI infrastructure sleeper on the entire market:

⸻

🧠 1. CSAI is solving the EXACT bottleneck AI giants are screaming about

NVIDIA, Meta, OpenAI, and pretty much every GPU-gobbling megacorp has said the same thing in every earnings call:

“We need more compute. We need cheaper compute. We need it yesterday.”

CSAI’s core product?
A modular AI compute layer that:
	•	runs on commodity hardware
	•	reduces training costs by 30–60% (based on internal docs + third-party reports)
	•	scales horizontally like wildfire
	•	is drop-in compatible with existing LLM pipelines

This means they aren’t competing against NVIDIA — they’re making NVIDIA’s customers more efficient, which is an infinitely easier business model to win.

⸻

📈 2. The crazy part: CSAI is trading like a dying LED manufacturer

Despite:
	•	200% YoY revenue growth
	•	6 new enterprise partnerships
	•	a federal pilot contract
	•	and a full patent portfolio…

…the market is pricing them as if they’re one missed earnings away from selling printers at Walmart.

Their current market cap: peanuts.
Their TAM: basically the GDP of a medium-sized country.

This disconnect is where ten-baggers are born.

⸻

🧪 3. Insider activity = 🔥🔥🔥

The CFO bought during a week where the stock dipped 22%.

14,NVDA,Peter Thiel’s latest 13F shows a full exit from Nvidia (NVDA),"Billionaire Peter Thiel’s latest 13F didn’t show off a mere trim, but a full-blown exit from AI bellwether Nvidia (NVDA).

It comes at a surprising point when Wall Street’s been busy declaring the chipmaker as virtually untouchable.

Although Nvidia recently surpassed a $5 trillion valuation, Thiel walked away completely, shrinking his fund’s equity book by roughly two-thirds while building it around three megacap names.

That’s far from being a rebalance and more of an emphatic statement.

Thiel had previously warned about AI’s hype cycle running far ahead of its real economics, and his Q3 portfolio shakeup aligns with that view.

Thiel’s Q3 filing unveiled perhaps the sharpest pivots of any major investor in the tech space so far this year.

While Nvidia continues to power through blowout quarters and leap past a $5 trillion market cap, Thiel Macro LLC heads in the opposite direction.

An era has ended. The stock market closed higher more than 1.5%. 🟢

🔸 Tuesday: The Senate passed the bill to end government shutdown and then White House announced that vote will be Wednesday. The stock market opened slightly lower after the yesterday's jump. For a long time, the stock market hasn't access key datas and Goldman Sachs said U.S. likely lost 50,000 jobs in October. Rate cut hope lifted tthe indexes and the stock market closed higher. 🟢

The stock market closed slightly higher like yesterday. Dow closed at a new record high and above 48,000 for the first time in history. However, Nasdaq fell as investors sold tech stocks. 🟢

🔸 Thursday: Trump signed the funding bill and ended the longest shutdown after 43 days. However, after the 4-day winning streak, the stock market opened under heavy selling pressure and dropped more than 1% due to economical datas that October's data could never release. The stock market's last week hero Michael Burry closed his hedge fund. Gold and silver were rising, but gold declined from $4,200 and could not break in this week.

The stock market opened lower around 1%. Fed's Logan said would be hard to support December rate cut. Labot Department gave some hope by saying that will release September jobs report Thursday due to government shutdown. The stock market recovered and closed flat, but it still sligtly negative. 🔴

After reaching a deal to end the government shutdown, the stock market stayed positive side during the first 3-day of the week. However, economical data is crucial for December rate cut hopes.

29,NVDA,Target (TGT) earnings,"I’m currently a shareholder and have been holding a substantial amount of TGT shares for a while. 

I’m thinking about doubling my position before earnings. My gut feeling is a potential drop in price after earnings wouldn’t be bigger than -5 % while a jump could be much bigger perhaps +20 %. 

My gut feeling has less to do with what has actually happened in the quarter such as reduction in workforce, change in omni and price reductions and more to do with just a look at how the stock price has been moving for a while. $85 is the 52w low and the price is currently $90. I imagine it could drop to near $85 on disappointing news. Meanwhile, the roof seems to be higher and while $95-100 is probably more likely, I don’t think it’s unimaginable that it could jump to $105 on an earnings beat. 

Nvidia is reporting the same day and we all know how that might affect the entire market. It’s just how the stock market works these days. It could actually add -/+ 5 % to whichever direction TGT moves on earnings. 

TGT is down 35 % year to date and from 2022-2025 it traded on average at $130 ish. Unless earnings are very disappointing, I just see it as more likely that the stock will go up than down on Wednesday when they report earnings. $105 is still very punished from past levels, while $85 or lower would suggest investors have very little faith in the company. I believe investors are longing for upside and will reward the stock on even just mildly positive results while it will take a lot for them to punish the stock even harder.

Personally I think this is the most likely scenario because as I said Jensen doesn't fuck up and I see them beating and raising guidance but I do not see the markets liking that. The overvalued narrative will take over again the same way it did with PLTR a few weeks back.

Now does this mean we're fucked? Is the bubble popping? Absolutely not. AI is huge and will continue to drive this market. It's just gonna shit the bed for a week or so and then once everyone forgets about it we'll be chugging right back along to ATHs.

30,NVDA,Nvidia’s Earnings and Share Price Trajectory,"**NVDA valuation**  
Forward P/E sits around 28 to 29 times.  
Street estimates call for FY 2026 EPS of about $4.55 and FY 2027 EPS near $6.76, equating to approximately 49 percent annual growth.  
Nvidia is guiding to roughly 54 percent revenue growth for the upcoming quarter with revenue estimates of 54 billion dollars.

**NVDA customers and their financial capacity**  
Many of Nvidia’s largest hardware customers rely on debt financed data centers or external financing structures. Their ability to continue purchasing at scale depends on interest costs, refinancing, and lender demand.

**CoreWeave**  
Q3 2025 revenue was 1.365 billion dollars, up from 584 million dollars.  
GAAP operating income was 51.9 million dollars or a 4 percent margin, down from 20 percent a year earlier.  
Interest expense was about 310.6 million dollars, more than six times operating income.  
Net loss: 110 million dollars.  
Total debt stands near 10.6 billion dollars with net debt around 9.3 billion dollars.  
Senior notes yield 9 to 9.25 percent.  
A 7.5 to 7.6 billion dollar GPU backed loan required covenant waivers.  
Leverage is estimated near 7 times EBITDA.  
CoreWeave purchases significant volumes of Nvidia hardware. Future purchase sustainability depends on refinancing capacity in addition to demand.

**xAI**  
Raising up to 12.5 billion dollars in debt and about 7.5 billion dollars in equity.  
Structured through an SPV that acquires Nvidia GPUs and leases them to xAI under multi year terms.  
Debt maturities cluster within a three to five year window.

**Meta Hyperion financing**  
A 27 to 29 billion dollar structure.  
Includes A rated bonds yielding about 6.6 percent and 3 billion dollars in equity from Blue Owl.

**AI data center project loans**  
Blackstone, KKR, Brookfield, DigitalBridge and others have arranged tens of billions in project level financing for AI focused data centers.

**AI cloud platforms such as Lambda Labs and Crusoe**  
Use venture debt, equipment leases, and asset backed facilities to scale GPU deployments.

Across these customers groups, approximately 50 to 70 billion dollars in debt is tied directly or indirectly to acquiring Nvidia hardware or building the infrastructure required to run it.

**Hyperscalers and broader AI capex**  
Microsoft is on pace for more than 80 billion dollars in AI enabled data center spending for fiscal 2025, with quarterly capex near 25 to 35 billion dollars and rising.  
Amazon raised its 2025 capex outlook to 125 billion dollars, with more than 100 billion dollars tied to cloud and AI.  
Alphabet increased its 2025 capex guidance to 91 to 93 billion dollars.  
Meta expects 70 to 72 billion dollars this year and has signaled higher spending in 2026.  
Oracle plans roughly 25 billion dollars to expand cloud and AI infrastructure.  
Together, these firms are on track for more than 150 billion dollars in AI related spending this year, and 370 to 400 billion dollars across future cycles.

**Implications for NVDA share price trajectory**  
A forward P/E near 28 assumes that hyperscalers and specialized cloud providers maintain or increase their rate of spending for several years.  
CoreWeave’s results show rising interest costs and contracting margins.  
Other leveraged buyers may face similar financing constraints.  
Hyperscalers continue to invest, but at capital costs well above levels from earlier in the cycle.  
If credit conditions tighten or refinancing slows, the growth rate implied in Nvidia’s valuation becomes more difficult to sustain.",104,34,1763221272.0,2025-11-15T15:41:12+00:00,t3_1oxusu4,StockMarket

Cyber offense isn’t bottlenecked by GPUs anymore. It’s bottlenecked by how fast bad actors can twist Western foundation models into tools. And every time Anthropic or OpenAI push for stricter export bans “for safety”, it weirdly ends with:

Michael Burry is betting that NVIDIA and the AI boom is really a bubble. His rationale is that companies that buy these chips are overstating their earnings or profitability. He says this is because they are not accurately depreciating their chips. The companies are saying they will last 5-6 years and he thinks they will last 2-3 years. If the companies are right, isn't this bad for NVIDIA? But if his argument is right, isn't that good for NVIDIA? If he is correct and these companies need new chips every 2-3 years doesn't that mean they will have to buy \~twice as many chips from NVIDIA to replenish their obsolete chips?

* electricity by calculating how much money we'd save on oils used for street lamps or
* smart phones by analyzing how many games and office apps we can fit on it.

Honestly, how do you properly quantify

* software writing agents that will build better uv machines to build better chips to build better ai? 

* the possibility of multiple agents working together to learn and teach and check each other's work? 

* everything you love that's enabled by software development -- imagine AI making that development faster so your favorite companies can now do more of what you love, faster and cheaper?

* how much more human genius will be unlocked when our smartest researchers are offloading the ""boring"" parts of their work to AI freeing them up to figure new things? The economic impact of penicillin wasn't just ""doctors work 10% faster"" ... it was entire disease categories eliminated. AI-amplified researchers might deliver breakthroughs that render entire industries obsolete or create trillion-dollar sectors that don't exist yet.

* how a near-infinite context window (I assume google will achieve this) model will allow us to have more in-depth projects and discussions with a specialized chatbot? A researcher could upload every paper ever written on cancer biology + every genetics study + every drug interaction database, and AI could synthesize connections no human could hold in his/her mind at one time.

* the full impact of AI connecting knowledge from two or three or 100 different fields as they learn concepts from one and apply to others, trying things humans never tried before?

For example, the painful experience of the Great Depression pushed policymakers to react much faster during the 2008 financial crisis by launching Quantitative Easing.

I feel like we’re seeing something similar now. During dotcom bubble, tons of companies with no real earnings skyrocketed and eventually collapsed. After that, the market became a lot less forgiving. 

If a company today can’t show solid results, its stock gets punished immediately. It’s tough for those companies, but overall system has become much healthier I think.

Even Nvidia gets hit if its results don’t match the market’s sky high expectations, despite posting strong numbers. That alone tells we’re not repeating the late-90s mistake again.

33,NVDA,[WSJ] Big Tech’s Soaring Profits Have an Ugly Underside: OpenAI’s Losses,"&gt;Investors take a lot of comfort from the solidity of Big Tech earnings as worries grow about artificial intelligence overinflating valuations. But those earnings have an ugly underbelly: ever-bigger losses at the generative AI startups that spend big on chips and data centers supplied by the profitable public companies.
&gt;
&gt;Quarterly profits soared at Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft as AI-related revenue poured in (Meta’s were wiped out by tax). Cash flows are mostly fine, albeit a lot is now going into building new data centers. Some of the money comes from actually selling AI services to businesses, particularly at Alphabet and Microsoft.
&gt;
&gt;But much of the AI-related profits come from being a supplier to, or investor in, the private companies building the large language models behind AI chatbots—and they’re losing money as fast as they can raise it, and plan to keep on doing so for years.
&gt;
&gt;OpenAI and Anthropic are the two largest suppliers of generative AI with their chatbots ChatGPT and Claude, respectively, and founders Sam Altman and Dario Amodei have become tech celebrities.
&gt;
&gt;What’s only starting to become clear is that the companies are also sinkholes for AI losses that are the flip side of chunks of the public-company profits.
&gt;
&gt;Both, along with plenty of other startups, are raising big money and committing to future spending that will require them to raise a lot more. As they spend it on chips and renting cloud computing, sellers of chips and cloud services are the winners and are spending heavily to expand.
&gt;
&gt;For this to continue, two things have to happen. First, the AI developers need to come up with winning products to cover their massive research and computing costs. Second, investors need to stump up enough to finance the losses—which OpenAI alone estimated at more than $150 billion—until then.
&gt;
&gt;It might all work out. The chatbots are near-magical experiences until they make a basic error like thinking 5.11 is bigger than 5.9, a problem even the latest versions still suffer from sometimes.
&gt;
&gt;Fix these, fix the gaping security holes and stop them “hallucinating,” or making up their own facts, and many more businesses and individuals will be willing to pay. New products based on the same underlying technology could become ubiquitous, and eventually transform society.
&gt;
&gt;But even their creators expect to lose money for a long time. OpenAI hopes to turn profitable only in 2030, while Anthropic is targeting 2028.
&gt;
&gt;Meanwhile, the amounts of money being lost are extraordinary.
&gt;
&gt;Microsoft’s share of OpenAI’s loss in the three months to Sept. 30 implies the startup lost more than $12 billion in the quarter. We don’t know for sure since it doesn’t publish its financial statements, but there were no obvious one-off events that would have led to enormous noncash write-downs.
&gt;
&gt;Among companies that have reported so far for the quarter, OpenAI’s loss matches the world’s biggest, that of satellite communications company EchoStar, according to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence data. But Echostar’s giant loss was due to a noncash charge of $16.5 billion to write off parts of its 5G cellphone network. OpenAI’s was most likely real money.
&gt;
&gt;It’s impossible to quantify how much cash flowed from OpenAI to big tech companies. But OpenAI’s loss in the quarter equates to 65% of the rise in underlying earnings—before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization—of Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta together. That ignores Anthropic, from which Amazon recorded a profit of $9.5 billion from its holding in the loss-making company in the quarter.
&gt;
&gt;A hefty part of the spending that generated OpenAI’s loss goes to highly paid engineers, but a lot goes into renting Nvidia chips from Microsoft’s cloud service—with much more to come. OpenAI committed to spend $250 billion more on Microsoft’s cloud and has signed a $300 billion deal with Oracle, $22 billion with CoreWeave and $38 billion with Amazon, which is a big investor in rival Anthropic.
&gt;
&gt;This demand for computing capacity is a big part of why data-center construction is in overdrive.
&gt;
&gt;But, to put it mildly, OpenAI doesn’t have the income to cover its costs. It expects revenue of $13 billion this year to more than double to $30 billion next year, then to double again in 2027, according to figures provided to shareholders. 
&gt;
&gt;Costs are expected to rise even faster, and losses are predicted to roughly triple to more than $40 billion by 2027. Things don’t come back into balance even in OpenAI’s own forecasts until total computing costs finally level off in 2029, allowing it to scrape into profit in 2030.
&gt;
&gt;These forecasts should be taken with a few server racks loaded with salt. OpenAI has only just settled on a corporate structure, its products are still in development, potential customers are still figuring out how, if at all, to use them, eventual pricing isn’t even at the guesswork stage, the competition is evolving rapidly and, well, nobody really knows how any of this will turn out.
&gt;
&gt;In the frenzy, investors have forgotten the old saying: Revenue is vanity, profits are sanity, cash is reality. If investors stop being so excited about AI, if OpenAI struggles to generate sales, or if fundraising becomes difficult for other reasons such as a recession, investors might switch back from the vanity of revenue to focus on the insane losses. 
&gt;
&gt;At that point, the reality that the flow of cash from OpenAI and its rivals is bolstering big tech earnings will become painfully clear.",275,13,1763083054.0,2025-11-14T01:17:34+00:00,t3_1owj04s,StockMarket

Alex Karp, in today's interview with [**Yahoo Finance**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6LakOrqDL4) demonstrated to be either a very convincing genius... or a Pathetically Pedantic Charlatan (PPC).

He was asked just a handful of of softball questions, none of which he answered in a coherent manner. He constantly derailed himself halfway through his responses by saying ""by the way"" and going completely off topic.

His body language was quite telling, as he kept touching his nose (a known sign of discomfort, nervousness or deception) and gesturing towards the interviewer, suggesting the questions should actually be different.

[The bolder the statement, the more he had to rub his nose...](https://preview.redd.it/0rd0ik4q091g1.jpg?width=2434&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1bca5b4f0122a2bd7c7a5b92bbb319c64ebfd5dc)

I find it interesting that for a person that hasn't served in the military, he openly brags about an institution he's never been a part of. Why does he need to sell the US military, as if he were a loudmouth general/admiral instead of just focusing on his organization?

Perhaps the most surprising argument was stating that ""[America is the only country in the world that provides everything from chips to anthology, above and below](https://youtu.be/-6LakOrqDL4?t=268)"".

Karp seems to be unaware that we rely on ASML equipment (Europe/Dutch) used by TSMC (Asia/Taiwan) to develop our AI hardware.

He not only talks like a cocky admiral, but also pretends to be Jensen Huang.

But make no mistake... Jensen and this clown have nothing in common.

Nvidia is over 10x larger than Palantir... and they actually generate incredible profits, with a reasonable valuation.

Jensen is the King of AI, not this clown.

.....and just last week, Jensen said ""[**China will win the AI race**](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/06/jensen-huang-says-china-will-win-the-ai-race-before-clarifying-in-a-statement-nvidia-trump-xi.html)"".

So on one side, you have an engineer, who is the most successful self made entrepreneur in human history... that **fully understands** parallel compute processing capabilities driving today's AI revolution... and on the other, a clown that studied philosophy and sociology in Germany, to partner with a German idiot who's constantly talking about the [**antichrist**](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/AWJkDol33SA)**.**

Hasn't anyone noticed that his hairstyle is a late version of Sam Bankman Fried's?

And just like SBF, he has a BS altruistic argument, pretending to work for everyday average Americans ""*welders, plumbers and truck drivers*"", which he mentioned twice during the interview (an obvious talking point)... But yeah, sure! Go get another PhD. in Deutschland, bitte!

I only wonder when South Park is adding Alex Karp to their cast.",349,260,1763057804.0,2025-11-13T18:16:44+00:00,t3_1ow8iq1,wallstreetbets
16,NVDA,Nvidia CEO reportedly said China will lead the AI race what does this mean for NVDA long term,"Position disclosure  
I currently hold NVDA shares for the long term  
There was a private conversation recently where Jensen Huang spoke with several well known figures from tech and finance  
According to people familiar with the meeting one comment stood out  
When asked about the next five to ten years of the global AI race he reportedly said  
China will win

THe statement surprised a lot of people because Nvidia sits directly in the middle of the US China policy battle  
Export rules have already limited Nvidia from selling its highest end chips into China and more restrictions could come in the future  
If the CEO truly believes China will scale AI faster it raises questions about how Nvidia positions itself in a more fragmented global market

From an investing standpoint there are a few ways to read this  
China has scale data infrastructure and a coordinated push to build domestic AI hardware  
If that accelerates Nvidia could face slower growth in one of its historically large markets  
On the other hand Nvidia still owns the software ecosystem and tools that dominate global training workloads  
EVEN if China builds alternatives it will likely take years to fully match CUDA the enterprise stack and the entire developer base built around Nvidia hardware  
In that sense Nvidia may remain the default platform for the rest of the world  
So the question for investors becomes  
Does this leaked comment suggest real long term risk to Nvidia or is it simply an acknowledgment of global scale differences that do not change the NVDA thesis

Curious to hear how others interpret this from an investment perspectivE

277,NVDA,AMD has once again roused the market and is profiting from it.,"Tech stocks appear poised to lead the rally again AMD's optimistic sales outlook undoubtedly fueled today's market gains.



The S&amp;P 500 rose for the fourth consecutive trading day, but overall market sentiment remains…cautious. This mix of optimism and fear has been evident in every recent rally.



Interestingly, concerns about AI spending have eased somewhat, but we remain on thin ice ahead of Nvidia's earnings report.



The market's current performance is completely beyond my trading strategy. Frankly, to profit from and hold AMD stock, everything must align perfectly timing, signals, and momentum must all be spot on.



Seeing my strategy working so smoothly still gets my adrenaline pumping, Lol.

18,NVDA,CRWV has plummeted; is now a good time to buy the dip?,"I've been following AI stocks for a while now. Yes, everyone's scrambling for Nvidia (NVDA), but honestly… a great GPU is useless if it can't be powered, cooled, or run, haha.

CRWV is a prime example. Basically, they're the ""plumbers"" of the AI ​​world. They build and run incredibly fast GPU cloud platforms. I've heard they're working with OpenAI and some other big companies. It's not flashy or glamorous, but someone has to do this, right?

Even cooler: they use liquid cooling in their data centers. Sounds ordinary, but it means higher efficiency, less energy waste, and servers that don't overheat under heavy load. Plus, they customize to meet customer needs, unlike AWS/Google Cloud, which offers a one-size-fits-all service.

The stock price plummeted from $187 to $87. It was painful. But their debt is primarily focused on infrastructure, not those questionable balance sheet issues. They feel like the ""backbone"" of the AI ​​world, a bit like the fiber optic internet companies of the 90s. I bought a small position at $87. Maybe it was a bit silly, maybe I entered too early. But if artificial intelligence really does experience explosive growth like the internet, someone has to pave the way, right?

19,NVDA,Why isn't Softbank selling NVDA to fund OpenAI bullish for AI?,"1. OpenAI primarily uses Nvidia GPUs

2. Nvidia also owns shares in OpenAI

3. OpenAI received permission from California to convert to for-profit which would triggered a clause in Softbank's deal to provide $20b additional funding to OpenAI. They needed liquidity to do this.

4. OpenAI will use the vast majority of Softbank money to buy indirect Nvidia compute via Oracle, Amazon, Microsoft, etc. 

5. The right gold digger made far more money than the shovel maker. See Amazon, Google, Microsoft vs Cisco in dotcom. Softbank thinks OpenAI is the right gold digger. It doesn't mean they see a bubble.

This seems like Softbank is all in on AI - not calling the top. They're taking even more risk in AI (moving investment from shovel maker to betting on a gold digger).",0,21,1762933742.0,2025-11-12T07:49:02+00:00,t3_1ouz5sx,stocks

20,NVDA,Apple Stock Gains With No Ad Support on Apple TV+,"In the recent interview with Apple’s Eddy Cue, when asked about an ad-supported tier: “I don’t want to say no forever, but there are no plans. If we can stay aggressive with our pricing, **it’s better for consumers not to get interrupted with ads**.”

Though this does make sense, it also leaves Apple TV+ in an odd position: it is one of very few major streamers that do not offer an ad-supported tier and with Apple also staying out of the hunt to buy Warner Bros. Discovery WBD, it is clear that Apple will continue to deviate from the norm in this sector, for better or worse...

21,NVDA,Softbank sell off - A fragile market," NVDA recently took a surprise hit from softbank, which id consider a firm outside the realm of wall streets typical social circle. Truth is, a lot of people talk. If you live in manhattan and know people, very seldom do billion dollar bank moves happen without a a little word spreading.

This is why is see this event as so unique. A 5 billion sell occurs and incurs a 400-800 billion loss in market cap becouse no one could figure out why.

I beleieve this price is still pinned extraordinarily high. Due to leverage concerns and the GME issue, its possible that greed is now going in the inverse direction. Aggressive price pinning on the high side is still highly profitable and less risky than aggressively shorting down a stock. 

Plus this gives more power to the bigger players. A retail rally is far more risky and proboble than a retail sell off. BYND saw something similar happen recently. When something is cheap, retail has power. Pin price way up - and retail is more likely to buy dips into an overvalued stock than collectively push a short squeeze.

Its just the same old greedy crap with a different angle. If a 5 billion sell off causes such a drop, just imagine what a 10-20 billion sell off would do? Price could be back to what it was in may overnight. After all, its gained 100 dollars since then.

&gt;Nebius Group has signed a deal worth about $3 billion with Meta to provide the Facebook owner with AI infrastructure over ​a five-year period, the company said on Tuesday, after it ‌reported a more than fourfold rise in third-quarter revenue.

&gt;The company's shares seesawed in volatile premarket trading,‌ after it posted a surge in capital spending and a quarterly loss of over $100 million, widening from $39.7 million last year.

&gt;The stock has been on a strong run this year, with its market value rising fourfold to $27.61 billion, through ⁠last close.

&gt;The agreement with Meta ‌underscores the surging demand for high-performance computing power that is required to build and run artificial intelligence models.

&gt;It is Nebius' second contract ‍with a hyperscaler, following its $17.4 billion deal with Microsoft in September.

&gt;Nebius said it would deploy the capacity needed for the Meta contract over the next three months, adding that ​the demand was so strong that the size of the contract had to be ‌limited to the capacity that Nebius had available.

&gt;Amsterdam-based Nebius is among a group of so-called neocloud companies that offer hardware and cloud capacity as services. Its core business involves providing Nvidia graphics processing units and AI cloud, helping companies expand their AI infrastructure.

&gt;Nebius and its larger rival CoreWeave have seen strong demand this year as insatiable ⁠AI appetite has left even the biggest cloud companies,​ such as Microsoft and Amazon, with capacity ​constraints.

&gt;Nebius reported a 355% jump in revenue to $146.1 million in the third quarter ended September.

&gt;The company is targeting $7 billion to ‍$9 billion in annualized ⁠run-rate revenue by the end of 2026, compared with its ARR of about $551 million at September-end.

&gt;Its capital expenditures ballooned to $955.5 ⁠million in the September quarter, from $172.1 million a year earlier, as the company invests ‌heavily in securing GPUs, land and power.",936,123,1762864731.0,2025-11-11T12:38:51+00:00,t3_1ou8d1e,wallstreetbets

28,NVDA,5600% Gains with Options,"Been investing with bi-weekly every time i received my paycheck for the last 5 years. Was just DCA'ing with no care about prices.

Studied options and did paper trading for about 1.5years. Was able to turn 10k into 45k after a year with fake money.

Decided to do options this year in my non-registered account around May. Started with $1000, and was doing 0dte calls and puts on NVDA and brought it to about $2400. Then got screwed by the Israel/iran war thinking oil was going to moon by full porting into oil stocks and there was a ceasefire immediately and my shit crashed hard. I was down to $400 and i almost said screw it options are not for me. Told myself to go again, but not to invest with emotion or get into hype. Used that as my first lesson to not fomo or trade around the news or hype, market is irrational.

I then put another $1700 in my non-registered account over June and July and made some leaps. Googl, AMD, NVDA,, NBIS, IREN, BABA, bidu, Amzn, MU, UNH and was doing Tesla puts and calls for weeks in August-September cause it kept going up and down every week like clockwork. I did have a leap on Tesla that i had which i sold after it broke above 400. My account slowly grew, i took profits too early on google when it first broke 207 as well as MU, and missed out on so much gains before jumping back in at 230 with Googl. Got really lucky with AMD as i had about 20k of leaps (10 contracts) i first bought when it dipped below 160 and DCA'd up in August and held until it hit 212. Sold 7 of my contracts and still holding the other 3.

I also bag held so many of these for months without paper handing. For example Oct 10, and this whole last week really tested my nerves, but had to take a step back and stick with my conviction and price targets. I knew it was temporary. Shit might dip again and this might just be a bull trap, but fuck it yolo. Get rich or die trying. I'm likely closing most of my positions by end of this month/beginning of December or once this account gets to $200k (whichever is sooner).

Every time i sold a position, i used that money to reinvest mostly in AMD and NVDA calls/leaps. UNH i had to close some of my positions at a loss but overall it was net profits with my UNH leaps. It just sucks cause i was up so much before Oct 28 and had so many calls in UNH :(

I know i am incredibly lucky

  
\*EDIT: A lot of people asked me where i paper traded. I used trading view and investopedia.

&gt;Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported slowing growth in monthly revenue, highlighting uncertainty over the sustainability of the AI boom even as industry behemoths including Nvidia Corp. chase more chip supplies.

&gt;The company posted a 16.9% rise in sales for October, the slowest pace since February 2024. Analysts on average are expecting sales to increase 16% in the current quarter. TSMC’s American depository receipts were up as much as 3% in pre-market trading.

&gt;Industry executives remain buoyant about AI-driven growth as major tech firms are accelerating investments in data centers. The TSMC revenue gain also just covers just a single month of business, offering investors less insight.

&gt;Investors were jolted last week by a sudden slump in Asia’s technology shares, which served as a stark reminder that the world-beating rally in artificial intelligence and semiconductor stocks may be nearing a short-term crest. Wall Street chief executives have warned of an overdue market correction, with Michael Burry’s Scion Asset Management also disclosing bearish wagers on Nvidia.

&gt;That’s despite massive ample spending plans from leading AI players.

&gt;Meta Platforms Inc., Alphabet Inc., [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com) Inc. and Microsoft Corp. will collectively spend more than $400 billion to fund an AI buildout next year, a 21% hike from 2025, to secure leadership in the race in emerging technologies.

&gt;Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang of Nvidia, which is the primary AI chip supplier to major companies, said on Saturday his business is “growing month by month, stronger and stronger.”

&gt;Huang met TSMC Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei and asked for more chip supplies during his two-day whirlwind trip to Taiwan this time when major chip designers are all chasing limited supplies from the Hsinchu-based company.

&gt;TSMC is also the go-to chipmaker for the Santa Clara, California-based firm’s competitors including Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Qualcomm Inc., and it makes Apple Inc.’s silicon for iPhones and other gadgets.

&gt;Huang’s optimism is shared by his rivals. Qualcomm Chief Executive Officer Cristiano Amon told Bloomberg TV last week that the world is underestimating how big AI will get.

&gt;In October, Wei told analysts that TSMC’s capacity was still very tight and the company is working hard to narrow the gap between demand and supplies.

27,NVDA,U.S. stocks are ready to party again?,"The U.S. government shutdown crisis has been resolved, and with the government reopening, it’s time for the market to turn the music back on and dance!

During the shutdown, the Treasury’s TGA account balance surged past $1 trillion for the first time in five years, sucking liquidity out of the market.

Many attributed the recent market pullback to the government shutdown and the resulting liquidity squeeze. While there’s talk of rate cuts on its surface, the reality felt like a ""stealth rate hike""...

Now, with the government back in business, the Treasury’s TGA account is set to release hundreds of billions of dollars back into the market, gradually restoring liquidity.

Combined with the typical year-end seasonal trends, this could ignite the next rally in risk assets—especially small-cap stocks and altcoins.

The Russell 2000, for instance, is up less than 10% YTD, significantly lagging behind the broader market. As for cryptocurrencies, the October 11 crash wiped out most of the leveraged long positions, making it feel like the market has bottomed out.

It might be time to cautiously anticipate a strong finish to the year and an optimistic start to the next.

History has shown that within every crisis lies opportunity—where there’s risk, there’s also potential.

I found one company today that was doing isotope separation for semiconductors but the numbers are VERY bad, its rising but might just be because of speculation with the whole semi industry.

When it comes to doing something like this I have the number connection (finviz) where I can see the live data but any suggestion for research and predicting future sectors/breakthroughs any ideas? Maybe investopedia?

Also doing this attempt strategy is this risky? Right now I'm finding companies that only contain solid growth companies with good sales/income that lessens my risk for loss, but is chasing a new sector risky with speculation?

Lastly, if doing this strategy would you suggest me doing the number approach (filtering out companies by trending volume/increase popularity) or go the research route?",7,34,1762614376.0,2025-11-08T15:06:16+00:00,t3_1orrnv0,stocks
30,NVDA,Decade of experience,"I think I should just throw it in ETFs

**EDIT for more info, Since this is getting eyeballs and people are asking:**

I’ve been trading for 10 years now. Not rich, not homeless... just a dude who has made every possible mistake, occasionally hit something real, and then promptly fumbled the bag again.

Some highlights along the way:

---

#### ASTS

I found ASTS way back during the SPAC era. I bought before it had a ticker, before the hype, before Reddit even knew what space-based 5G was.

I spent 5 years accumulating. Over 10,000 shares, plus a stupid amount of calls. My average cost was around $4.

I held through it all

* Dilution
* Missed launches
* “We swear the network is live” investor calls
* The CEO looking like he was aging in dog years

Then 2024 came. I had lost faith. I sold basically everything for a tiny loss. That position would be worth over $1,000,000 today.

Instead I took like a $3k loss.

---

#### NVDA

I got in on the first AI run-up, not the late one.

Bought $17,000 worth of $100 strike calls mid/late-March 2024.
Expiration was April. And so it began.

NVDA was unstoppable. Every day I kept thinking, this can't continue... until it reached a point where it was more like, now that's its surpassed a threshold, this can't NOT continue. I bought. It stopped its rocketship upwards almost immediately. But I had faith as I watched my options half, and then half again. Hell, I bought more. At a certain point, I just said screw it, I'm seeing this through, all or nothing. 

And it DID finally go up. But it didn’t go up-up until shortly AFTER my expiration.

I lost it.

If I had rolled them out THREE WEEKS at the low point: The profit would have been over $100k.
I didn’t roll. I just stared and let time decay eat my soul.

---

#### GME

Yes. I was there. That big spikey spike you see right before the endless dropping. That's it. But I wanted more.
So I bought more. I bought the top. Sold the bottom. Bought back in. Sold lower. Repeated like a lab rat pressing a dopamine button.

---

#### ETH 

My biggest regret. It's not in the chart but a friend of mine got me on crypto early. I bought around 2,000 ETH at like $17. That would be OVER SIX MILLION today. I did actually make a profit of like $30k here, and at the time I was rather pleased with myself.

OVER SIX MILLION if I had held. ALMOST SEVEN. At today's price, $6,799,680.

---


#### Other Notable Trades / Character Development Moments

* Random biotech phase — I turned $4k into $18k and then back to $0 because I “liked the chart.”
* SPY options era — I contributed meaningfully to someone else’s Hamptons house.
* Margin interest that one year:
  My 1099 literally shows I paid $1,800+ in margin interest to Robinhood in 2021.
  I paid interest to lose money.

---

### What I’ve Learned:

* The bag is real, but the bag doesn’t wait.
* If your conviction lasts 5 years but your patience lasts 5 minutes, you are just donating.
* Rolling options is not optional.
* Stop losses are probably a good idea.
* The market rewards psychopaths and people who forget they own things.

---

**TLDR: My portfolio isn’t diversified by sector, it’s diversified by types of bad decisions**.

23,NVDA,Stop using “Market Cap” to sensationalize things,"Is it just me or anyone else finding it annoying when people/ news outlets using market cap of company which basically calculates as company’s equity (share price × number of shares) to influence a certain narrative for day like this ? Which has nothing to do with the company itself 

It’s literally not the company’s true financial strength , fundamental or performance .

But headlines like:

•NVDA just erased 500 billion market cap

• The US stock market just lost 1 trillion in 1 days 

Just to paint the picture/ narrative that the doom day is here . even though it’s mostly price fluctuation and “not real money vanishing or a reflection of a company collapsing.”


• Even worse, some people in this group use market cap as a deciding factor for investing .

Like this company worth 400 billions so that mean it would be a safe investment and avoid more quality small company just because it has small market cap instead of analyzing the real stuffs.",0,16,1762564476.0,2025-11-08T01:14:36+00:00,t3_1orc6v0,stocks

25,NVDA,The market was vulnerable. At a crossroads now.,"Reposting but without prior context since that's apparently frowned upon here. A week ago the market looked fragile due to the potent combination of breadth deterioration, MAGS-led complacency, TA vulnerabilities, and a climbing VVIX/VIX ratio, among other things. 

In line with recent times when we’ve seen this combination, the S&amp;P futures have now pulled back over 3%. Downside setups were strong.

At the portfolio level, I kept my anchor stocks (NVDA, AAPL, AMZN etc) but sold all speculative stocks and increased portfolio cash to about 53%. **I'll wait until the below resolves until I increase positioning to 90% or more**, but have just begun to add to one position showing relative strength.

So where do we stand now and how may this help evaluate what comes next?

* The percentage of stocks above the 50-day MA has dropped a further 11% as compared to \~25% deterioration in the four-day period noted last week. So while we’ve seen some slowdown in that regard, the overall trajectory is clearly down and at levels on par with what we saw in April. 
* MAGS led index prices to new all-time highs this past week, but without the rally broadening out, the indices were super vulnerable. This week though, there is some welcome relief as the rising S&amp;P equal weight : SPY ratio indicates broadening participation and improving market structure. 
* Last week I noted that the rising VVIX/VIX was our early sign that risk was ahead, though masked by headline index prices. As the VIX pushed over 21 today, we’ve not seen VVIX rise as fast and so this ratio has fallen substantially. 
* That decline indicates volatility demand is normalizing, suggesting the market is absorbing the shock rather than escalating it.
* In fact, this ratio is now back to where it was in mid-October, when the S&amp;P 500 futures (and index/SPY) tested the trend channel which developed coming out of April weakness. Prices are there again now, again testing the 50-day moving average and hovering just above the cloud model. Unfilled gaps created on the way up, a sign of weak structure, have now been filled (while a new one was created today).
* Elsewhere in the credit markets, short-term treasuries are outperforming high yield corporate bonds. That’s consistent with risk-off rotation but not yet systemic stress, since spreads are widening in an orderly fashion.
* This leaves markets at a critical juncture and not nearly as clear as last week’s reading. Three technical things to watch will be: 1) Ability to recover the 50-day, 2) Reaction at cloud model, 3) Ability to recover primary trend. A bonus is how we see stochastics, pictured below, react at oversold levels. Recovering these levels would suggest the pullback was corrective instead of the start of something major.
* Seasonally, the market performs well November to year-end, though it's too early to count on that.

29,NVDA,NEGG: the Easter egg the market forgot,"Alright, listen up regards. Not financial advice.

**The 10-second pitch**

* Tiny tradable float, big e-com brand.
* Expensive borrow. Shorts playing hot potato.
* Fundamentals improving while AI demand funnels GPUs right through their store.

**What it is**  
Newegg Commerce (NASDAQ: NEGG). Online retailer for PC parts, GPUs, gaming, and more. Also runs B2B e-commerce services.

* **Float:** \~1,000,000 shares.
* **Short interest:** \~25% of float.
* **Borrow fee:** \~400%. Translation: small supply, crowded shorts, costly to sit short. Any demand spike = pain.

**Who’s loading**  
Vladimir Galkin + spouse reportedly sit near **20%** ownership. Consolidating hands means fewer shares in the wild. Shorts hate musical chairs with one chair.

# The Galkin Lore: from tendies to jet fuel to GPUs

* **Who are these two?** Vladimir and Angelica Galkin. Florida couple. Electronics-wholesale money (co-founded HUBX in Miami), then meme-market side quests.
* **How’d they get stacked?** They rode the original meme dragon. He told media he made serious money on memes and at one point had \~80% of his net worth in memes. Then he rotated into airlines like a final-boss value investor.
* **Jet fuel arc:** By 2024 they disclosed a near-10% stake in JetBlue, spending about **$212.8M** via cash and margin and even sniffing around board seats. Translation: not tourists.
* **NEGG arc:** In 2025 they started Hoover-ing NEGG. SEC says Vladimir + Angelica file **as a married pair** and now report roughly **18–19%** of the company through joint beneficial ownership.
* **They keep buying dips like it’s cardio:** Example: **222,222** NEGG shares scooped in one July session. Palindrome flex.
* When a couple who minted tendies on memes and then tried to fix an airline starts cornering a micro-float e-commerce name that sells GPUs, you at least check a chart. If nothing else, respect the storyline equity.
* Short % of float was recently \~**25%** and borrow has been punitive. That combo in a tiny tradable pool is how face-melts happen. Check the data before you ape, but the setup isn’t imaginary.

Nvidia's stock decline caps a brutal week for the chipmaker, with shares on track to end the five-day period down more than 10% as of midday.

White House artificial intelligence and crypto czar David Sacks wrote on X, ""There will be no federal bailout for AI. The U.S. has at least 5 major frontier model companies. If one fails, others will take its place.""

Sacks went on to say, ""I don’t think anyone was actually asking for a bailout. (That would be ridiculous.) But company executives can clarify their own comments.""",365,91,1762536538.0,2025-11-07T17:28:58+00:00,t3_1or0lou,stocks

283,NVDA,What numbers and figures indicate we’re in a bubble?,"The common consensus and pretty much assumption on this sub is that we’re in an AI bubble. I guess my question is what numbers / figures indicate we’re in a bubble.

I understand the argument most people are making: ai capex (data centers) are propping up the economy because the M7 are spending billions to build them. The bubble argument (correct me if I’m wrong ) is that 

a) the ROI from the capex investment isn’t there yet and thus when it comes to pay people back a bubble will pop

b) there is a “loop” of investment between hardware guys investing in the software guys who then in turn invest/buy again in the hardware guys. Thus it’s an artificially inflated market and bubble.


My question for scenario a) is when will m7 stop funding the data centers and run out of money? Are there any metrics or numbers on this ? In theory as long as the m7 has enough money to fund these data centers won’t the bubble continue ?


For scenario b) how much money is in this closed loop of investment and how much is it inflating the market / how does it compare to the rest of ai capex spend ? For example people often point out that Nvidia invested in Open AI who will use that money to buy Nvidia hardware. This can inflate the market I understand, but how much is it inflating the numbers ? Any metrics on this ?

27,NVDA,Thoughts on good ol' Reddit stocks? $RDDT,"Reddit dropped last month after an ATH of 270 dollars, now down to 180 dollars a share. After earnings on the 27th of October, they even rose to 230 dollars in between, before dropping down again. The stock at its current price still has a PE ratio of 100, which could mean it is overvalued, however citigroup valued its target still 250 dollar a stock on the 21st of october, Piper Sandler at 290 in September and Needham even 300 in september. 

From my experience these advices do not mean too much, but it is still a sign that big investment companies believe it is worth more than it currently is. Reddit is a promising platform: you get advice based on real-life experience from people and you can directly discuss that advice or get more info (as I am doing now). You have many different active subreddits all specifically tailored to your questions and interests. 

$RDDT took a blow after AI-related businesses could no longer harvest its content for free, but to me that does not make sense: is that not an opportunity for reddit to get money more for its content? Also, after Michael Burry shorted NVDA an PLTR, RDDT seemed to take a blow. Does this mean people associate it with AI-stocks as well? Or is it rather a stock people drop more quickly because of FUD?

 • Tech equities (especially NVIDIA, Microsoft, etc.)

 • AI startup valuations

Analysts now say it’s 17x bigger than the dot-com boom and 4x the 2008 housing bubble…but this time, it’s tied directly to global economic growth.



The risk is that AI hype might be fueling markets built more on speculation rather than real value.

297,NVDA,my two cents,"$QQQ $NVDA $SPY $NDAQ $PLTR  it's pretty obvious what's happening here fellas - we gapped up for nearly 10 days straight with no meaningful pullbacks, some of y'all FOMOd into the top which is exactly what MMs and institutions were looking for so they could sell at a premium.

This pullback was bound to happen and is ideal for funds to load up at a discount into a year end santa rally. Once the year closes, that's when I'd begin to load up on shorts as this bull cycle cools down a bit. Take a look at this [chart](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/34/us-stock-relative/89294/sp500-finra) if you're interested in the macro side of things - historically, a spike in FINRA Margin Balance to this extent typically signals the start of a significant downtrend.

273,NVDA,GOOGL Six Figure Gains,"I went into GOOGL with almost every penny I had across all my accounts including all non 401k retirement accounts. I bought my first LEAP in February along with my first significant batch of shares. The rest were added in July in anticipation of a favorable court ruling on the search business. 

My other main reason for going so heavy in GOOGL was that I believed it would thrive and be one of the main beneficiaries of AI. Especially due to its TPUs and Google Cloud scaling on a massively scale with a backlog in the tens of billions(now 150+ billion). 

Of my initial position, I have only sold 2k-ish worth of shares which I moved to LULU a few weeks ago. I also sold a LEAP prior to the most recent earnings. 

I intend to continue holding this position for an extended period and to only trim based on incremental net worth milestones if it continues to grow significantly in the short/medium term.

274,NVDA,Why Super Micro computer is the obvious play,"Super Micro Computer (SMCI) remains a high-conviction play in the AI infrastructure space, leveraging its rack-scale server expertise and tight Nvidia partnerships to capture explosive demand. Despite a post-earnings dip to ~$42 (down ~10% on Nov 5), the stock trades at an undemanding valuation, setting up asymmetric upside as deferred revenues unlock in Q2. With a massive &gt;$14B order backlog and expanding manufacturing capacity, SMCI is positioned for multi-year growth in the AI data center buildout—think hyperscalers upgrading to Blackwell GPUs at scale.

Q1 FY26 Results &amp; Updated Q2 Guidance: Q1 revenue came in at $5.02B (miss vs. $6.09B est., -18% QoQ), with EPS at $0.35 (vs. $0.41 est.), pressured by ~$1.8B in deferred rack shipments tied to customer validations and supply chain timing. Margins held steady at ~14.5%, reflecting cost controls amid volume ramps. However, the real story is the new Q2 guidance, upgraded in the earnings call to reflect full deferred recognition: official range of $5.9B–$6.2B, but management explicitly signaled “double-digit potential” (10B+), driven by Q1 deferrals + accelerated Blackwell system deployments. Analysts (e.g., Rosenblatt, Barclays) model $9–11B for Q2—a ~100% QoQ surge—aligning with FY26 full-year outlook now raised to ≥$36B. This isn’t organic weakness; it’s a classic timing shift, with no lost orders.

Current Valuation: At $42, SMCI trades at a rock-bottom ~0.7x FY26 P/S (on $36B rev guidance), vs. peers like Dell (1.2x) and HPE (1.0x)—and that’s before baking in the Q2 upside to 40–44B annualized run-rate. Forward P/E ~15x on expected $2.80+ EPS, with ROIC accelerating on AI margins. The dip embeds bearish fears of volatility, but ignores the backlog’s strength and capex tailwinds (Malaysia/USA factories at full tilt).

Historical Pattern &amp; Catalysts: SMCI’s playbook is consistent: Q1/Q2 “misses” on deferrals (3/3 since 2024), followed by Q3/Q4 beats (avg. +10% vs. est., +50–180% stock gains over 3–12 months). Q2 here mirrors Q1’24’s setup but with 2x the backlog and Nvidia’s GPU guarantees. Key catalysts: Blackwell validation completions (Dec), hyperscaler wins (5+ in queue), and no major bottlenecks.

* Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang initially told the FT that China would “win the AI race,” before clarifying that America must “race ahead.”
* Huang contrasted China’s pro-industry energy subsidies with what he described as excessive Western regulation.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang [reportedly](https://www.ft.com/content/53295276-ba8d-4ec2-b0de-081e73b3ba43) told the Financial Times on Wednesday that “China is going to win the AI race,” only to release a notably softer statement soon after. 

The prolific tech leader was speaking on the sidelines of the FT’s Future of AI Summit, where he warned that China would beat the U.S. in artificial intelligence thanks to lower energy costs and looser regulations.

The comments, which CNBC could not verify independently, would represent Huang’s starkest warning yet that the U.S. is at risk of losing its global lead in advanced AI technologies.

My country broker doesnt allow partial shares so can only buy whole ones.

Or what matters the most, low average or higher average but more shares using profits? 

My logic says the latter since it feels like the more money you got into a company combined with share amount the better it is regardless of average that much atleast because of the percental diffrence between average and stock price.

Example: percental diffrence between 140-150 is lower than 130-150 so amount of increase on portfolio value is depended on those numbers.",14,10,1762446570.0,2025-11-06T16:29:30+00:00,t3_1oq3kci,stocks

He, however, lamented that the Chinese government has shut it out of its market.

China’s access to advanced AI chips, particularly those produced by Nvidia — the world’s most valuable company by market capitalization — remains a flashpoint in its tech rivalry with the United States, as both nations vie for supremacy in cutting-edge computing and artificial intelligence.

""We want America to win this AI race. No doubt about that,"" Huang said in the Nvidia developers' conference held in Washington last month.

34,NVDA,Is this idea almost too easy?,"I have been swing trading for a while and had an Idea. I’m considering writing a script that trades options through Interactive Brokers, but the idea seems almost too straightforward.

Here’s the concept:
I’d buy a derivative (option) on an underlying asset that has recently dropped but is likely to rise again — for example, NVIDIA. I’d set a tight stop loss at around 5% and a limit sell at 15%.

The script would continuously monitor the value of the option, and if the price goes up, it would automatically adjust the stop loss upward — so eventually, even if the stop gets triggered, I’d still end up in profit. Of course, the same applies if the limit sell is hit.

If it were really that simple, everyone would probably be doing it.

36,NVDA,Goodyear Tire (GT) Reiterated Post Earnings,"
TLDR: That new funny tv show about tires with Shane Gillis came out and also it has been a goodyear. Also they are at 52 week lows and their fair value is consensus of over $12

🛞 Goodyear Tire (GT) DD – A Surprisingly Good Year

Ok, hear me out: Goodyear (GT) is not the sexiest stock in the world. It doesn’t have AI in the name, Elon isn’t tweeting about it, and no one’s buying tires to flex on Instagram. But that’s kind of the point. While everyone’s been distracted by Nvidia melting faces and meme stocks rising from the dead, Goodyear’s quietly had… a good year.

Why GT is Interesting Right Now 1.	Fundamentals are improving – Goodyear’s been cleaning up its balance sheet, selling off non-core businesses, and paying down debt. It’s not debt-free yet, but the trend is heading the right way. Investors love “turnaround” stories. 2.	Stable demand – Cars need tires. Planes need tires. EVs? They chew through tires faster because they’re heavier and accelerate harder. So even if people stop buying new cars, they still have to replace old tires. That gives Goodyear a floor. 3.	Cultural clout boost – That Shane Gillis bit about sketchy tire shops went viral, and it’s funny but also free advertising for the concept of tires. Add in the easy pun (“It’s been a Goodyear”) and suddenly you’ve got a brand people are talking about again. 4.	Valuation – GT trades at a market cap of ~$4B. For context, that’s tiny compared to car companies or even some EV startups that don’t sell anything. If Goodyear keeps tightening operations and cashing in on steady demand, it’s undervalued relative to its role in the economy.

My ANALysis results….

This isn’t a meme YOLO stock. Think of it more like a “boring stock that might quietly double.” Shares under $15 look cheap if management keeps delivering.

290,NVDA,Relocating stocks profits into mutual funds or value stocks?,"
Sorry this might be long...  
  
I'm 46 and just starting out. At the beginning of the year I had $57K in my self employed 401K. Yes, I know I'm late to the game but I'm investing between $24K-$30K a year now. This year was the first year I actually invested the money into funds vs kept a money market.  
  
Please, no snarky or mean comments about me being behind schedule for investing. I am doing my very best.  
  
As you can see below I am tech heavy, and did so purposely to try and make up time lost on investing. While the market has dropped today (11-4-2025), on average my portfolio has been earning around 35%, which I think is excellent for a first timer lol. I also know it won't last and depending on the SCOTUS ruling on tariff's I could lose most of it, which I don't want.  
  
I don't have anyone else to talk to about investing right now so ya'll are it! Fidelity and my bank require a minimum amount in my account in order to be provided an advisor and frankly I feel like they would've told me to pull all my money in a mutual fund or ETF anyway. I would've missed out on a lot of money had I done that.  
  
My questions are (I have several)
1. As long as the market is doing well, at the end of the year or whenever, should I take profits for my stocks and relocate them into mutual funds, while keeping maybe $4-$5K in cash reserves for dips? Or maybe a percentage?  I got Tesla at such a great price this year I'm hesitant to sell any of it but will if it's necessary. 
2. FXAIX and FBGRX are great mutual funds and both are performing extremely well, but both also share many of the same mag. 7 stocks so they feel unnecessary to me -- they are both always going up or down which isn't good. Maybe I need something with stable growth during times when the market goes down, crashes or there's a recession? Ideas or suggestions?  
  
If you agree, which so I get rid of and why? Even with investor fees, my FBGRX consistently outperforms FXAIX over the last 10+ years, so I feel like as a more risk tolerant investor I should keep that one. On the other hand, I know the downturn and recovery are longer for FBGRX vs FXAIX, although it's not great for either. I need some suggestions on how to handle this dilemma.  
  
I also considered putting all of my FXAIX money into 1-2 safe consumer staples stocks such as PG and Walmart, and just start adding to those stocks (keeping the FBGRX only) but fear I'd miss out on compound interest over the long term i.e. 15-20 yrs. Is it smart to keep value stocks vs mutual funds? Can I make more doing that?  
  
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
For reference, as of yesterday, I made $19K in profits from the mesley $57,000 I had in my 401K account this year using the below.

After the announcement, the stock rose nearly 10%, showing strong investor response to the development especially the ones trading it in some uex like bitget with the stock futures rush phase 4 participation mindset. On the other hand, the Q3 2025 report, recorded 11.48% revenue growth and an improvement in gross margin to 34.68% to Amazon. However, EPS growth slowed to 49.05%, which could mean profitability might face some pressure ahead. Broader factors like inflation and Federal Reserve decisions could also affect sentiment in the coming months.

  
Though Insider activity during the period was minimal. CEO Douglas J. Herrington sold 2,500 shares for about $542,750, while Director Daniel P. Huttenlocher received 4,695 restricted stock units with no direct monetary value. Both transactions appear routine and consistent with executive compensation practices.

  
Most of the analysts opinions remain generally positive. With the current share price sitting around $244 while targets from major firms are higher, with Cantor Fitzgerald at $315, Bank of America at $303, and Wedbush at $280. These projections suggest that analysts still expect more upside from Amazon despite short-term challenges.

302,NVDA,The U.S. stock market is increasingly diverging from the real economy,"Charts show that since 2010, the S&amp;P 500 has significantly outpaced GDP growth, corporate profits, and money supply expansion.

By 2025, the S&amp;P 500 index is approximately six times its 2010 level, while nominal GDP has only roughly doubled over the same period.

Since the pandemic, loose liquidity and surging tech stocks have further driven up equity prices. U.S. stock valuations have clearly deviated from economic fundamentals, with structural divergence trends intensifying.

30,NVDA,There is no AI Bubble.,"I don't actually know if I agree with this. I just want you, the fine team of reddit experts, to make arguments as to why we are not in a bubble and there will come no crash. 

I have a few points of my own to add to this hypothesis, feel free to expand or destroy them.

**A**. Most of the money these large companies (i.e NVDA, Apple, Google) are mass investing are not being pulled from shareholders but there own giant cash piles, they are financially fine and really fucking cash rich, they have had these piles of cash sitting gathering dust for years. If share holders faulter, this means nothing in terms of risk to the actual companies.

**B**. I think people are both over and underestimating the effect of AI. Yes I know, brilliant take by me. But basically what I mean is   
  
\- overestimating in that AGI is not going to happen, not from LLM's, these models are just never going to reach that.   
\- underestimating in that even if AGI isn't happening, these ai's are going to be integrated as standard in someway into virtually every single business. Not taking jobs, not entirely. Some sure, but only in that the most people will be more efficient, But AI is so helpful.   
  
We will see dozens upon dozens of essentially AI consultancy/integration companies utilising or building task or sector specific AI helpers, for every industry. Even just as a tool for sorting, processing and pulling internal company information, if nothing else, it is ridiculously helpful and valuable. If you have ever worked at like a large energy company, you will know how much time is lost just sorting and digging through documentation.    
  
This I think will of course kill OpenAI, or at least dilute its market share. .    
  
  
**C**.  Donald trump is going to do everything he can to artificially keep the stock market growing if need be.

295,NVDA,Microsoft signs $9.7 billion cloud deal with IREN as AI demand swells,"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-signs-9-7-billion-110844856.html

&gt; Microsoft has struck a $9.7 billion deal with data-center operator IREN that includes access to Nvidia's advanced chips, aiming to ease ​the computing crunch that has kept the tech giant from fully cashing in on the ‌artificial intelligence boom. The news sent shares of IREN up as much as 24.7% to a record high on Monday, ‌with the stock last up nearly 10%. AI-server maker Dell was also up about 1%, as it would provide IREN with Nvidia's GB300 chips and other equipment that Microsoft will use for about $5.8 billion. The five-year Microsoft deal shows the AI industry's growing hunger for ⁠computing power to run applications such ‌as ChatGPT. It follows earnings from major tech companies last week that underscored capacity shortages were limiting their ability to fully benefit from the boom.

&gt; Partnering with IREN ‍would allow Microsoft to expand computing capacity without building new data centers or securing additional power - two of the biggest hurdles slowing its ability to meet surging AI demand. It will also sidestep heavy capital spending on ​chips that will lose value as newer, more powerful processors arrive. Such demand has propelled so called ‌""neocloud"" companies such as CoreWeave and Nebius Group - which sell cloud computing services built on Nvidia's processors - ahead in the AI race. Microsoft recently also signed a deal worth $17.4 billion with Nebius for infrastructure capacity.

&gt; IREN, which had a market value of $16.52 billion as of last close after a more than six-fold surge in its shares this ⁠year, has multiple data centers across North America with ​a total capacity of 2,910 megawatts. The company said the ​Nvidia processors are scheduled for phased deployment through 2026 at its 750-megawatt Childress, Texas, campus, alongside new liquid-cooled data centers designed to deliver about ‍200 megawatts of critical ⁠IT capacity. Cash from Microsoft's prepayment will help finance part of its $5.8 billion Dell deal, IREN said. Its Microsoft contract could be terminated if it fails to meet ⁠the delivery timelines.",137,10,1762229761.0,2025-11-04T04:16:01+00:00,t3_1onxxr6,stocks

296,NVDA,"Palantir tops estimates, boosts fourth-quarter guidance on AI adoption","Palantir reported quarterly results that topped analysts’ estimates and issued better-than-expected guidance for the fourth quarter, attributing much of its strength to artificial intelligence.

Here’s how the company did compared to LSEG estimates

**Earnings per share**: 21 cents vs. 17 cents expected

**Revenues**: $1.18 billion vs. $1.09 billion expected

Palantir, which builds analytics tools for large companies and government agencies, said it expects revenue of $1.33 billion for the current period, exceeding the $1.19 billion expected by analysts, according to LSEG.

The optimistic guidance comes even as the government shutdown stretches into its second calendar month, and potentially threatens some key contracts. Revenue in Palantir’s government business grew 52% in the quarter from a year ago to $486 million.

Government sales, particularly from military agencies, have been central to Palantir’s ongoing ascent. Over the years, Palantir has steadily beat out major legacy government contractors, and recently landed a deal worth up to $10 billion contract with the U.S. Army.

Palantir has also faced criticism over how its tools are being used by government agencies, including U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Total revenue in the quarter jumped 63% from $725.5 million a year ago, exceeding $1 billion for the second straight quarter. Net income more than tripled to $475.6 million, or 18 cents per share, from $143.5 million, or 6 cents per share, a year earlier.

For the full year, Palantir now expects about $4.4 billion in sales, topping the $4.17 billion forecast by Wall Street. The company also bumped up its full-year free cash flow outlook to between $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion.

Palantir’s commercial business more than doubled to $397 million. Total contract value for commercial deals closed more than quadrupled to $1.31 billion. Over the last few weeks, the company has announced new partnerships with Snowflake, Lumen and Nvidia.

Retail investors have helped drive Palantir’s skyrocketing stock price to new heights. The shares have surged more than 170% this year, lifting the company’s market cap past $490 billion and cementing the company among the most valuable technology names in the world.

Analysts have raised concerns about the stock, which trades at an extreme multiple relative to technology behemoths with far more revenue. In a letter to shareholders, Karp called out the “detractors” who have been “left in a kind of deranged and self-destructive befuddlement.”

“The reality is that Palantir has made it possible for retail investors to achieve rates of return previously limited to the most successful venture capitalists in Palo Alto,” he wrote. “And we have done so through authentic and substantive growth.”

37,NVDA,Why the bubble narrative is a generational GOOG buying opportunity,"Have gotten 20+ messages asking me if / when I plan to sell my GOOG LEAP position. So sharing my thoughts here:

You basically can’t go 20 seconds without hearing someone mention the tech / AI bubble these days. It’s completely unavoidable and is shaping how people invest more than you may realize. But here’s why I think this narrative is actually creating a generational buying opportunity for a few companies.

People are conflating the AI bubble and the massive growth of the Mag 6. But fail to acknowledge that, barring Nvidia, the Mag 6 growth is almost 100% due to non-LLM based bottom line growth. These monopolies are putting up Jokic numbers that justify these valuations.

This brings us to Google, one of the most oversold stocks in the entire market (until very recently). After reporting a record breaking 100M revenue quarter, and beating EPS expectations by over 30%, GOOG stayed completely flat. Touted as part of the “frothy and way overbought” Mag 7, GOOG’s PE ratio of 27.91 is LOWER THAN SPY’s PE of 28.89.

Let me repeat that for you:

One of the three companies that can manufacture cutting edge AI chips at scale, the HIGHEST NET PROFIT COMPANY ON THE PLANET, that grew every part of its business double digits YoY, has a lower PE ratio than:

-Walmart
-Caterpillar
-Costco
-Nike
-Hilton
-Pepsi


Talk about overvaluation. I’d argue the rest of SPY is more bubbly, as they are being bought via Index funds en masse due to MAG 7 gains, but aren’t being shorted like the MAG 7 are because that doesn’t fit the narrative.


The way I see it, even if we are in a bubble, google does not depend on AI contracts dated 1-4 years out in the way that other players in the space do, as they consume the lions share of their own compute with their money printing businesses.


And if we aren’t in a bubble, and those who control AI control the world, then google is probably the best positioned company out there. They have the strongest AI talent, have several already vetted AI business (Isomorphic labs, Waymo, Search, Shorts), own the entire AI stack: applications, models, chips, data centers (they have 10+ yoe building massive TPU data-centers on time).


The absurd undervaluation compared to its peers (AMZN, MSFT, AAPL, NVDA) won’t last forever. Given google is the most profitable business in the world, either the rest of the Mag 6 need to show growth rates significantly higher than google’s absurd pace to justify the 30-40% premium, or GOOG will need to show signs of slowing down. But that’s not what we’re seeing today, and I’m tired of pretending that GOOGL is at all “overvalued” due to the AI bubble.  it’s arguably the other way around.

(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp can add trillions more to its valuation after making history as the first company to ever breach a $5 trillion market capitalization, according to at least one analyst.

Loop Capital Markets on Monday raised its price target to a Street-high view of $350, up from $250. The new target represents upside of more than 70% from Nvidia’s last close of $202.49, and implies a market cap of more than $8.5 trillion. The average target is $231.

“We are entering the next ‘Golden Wave’ of Gen AI adoption and NVDA is at the front-end of another material leg of stronger-than-anticipated demand,” wrote Loop analyst Ananda Baruah.

Nvidia is about to begin a ramp of Blackwell graphic processing unit chips “that will essentially double its unit shipments the next 12-15 months while seeing the benefit of ASP expansion,” Baruah said, referring to average selling prices.",588,154,1762183389.0,2025-11-03T15:23:09+00:00,t3_1oneluc,stocks
32,NVDA,NVDA and AMZN are in the spotlight again. Trump’s new AI chip stance might explain why,"$NVDA and $AMZN have been dominating the headlines this week, and it’s not hard to see why. Trump just said that Nvidia’s most advanced AI chips will be reserved exclusively for U.S. companies, keeping them out of China and potentially other countries. The move could reshape how AI infrastructure develops globally, and investors seem to be pricing in the implications fast.

It’s a huge statement not just for Nvidia but for any tech firm tied to cloud, AI, or chip supply chains. $AMZN, being heavily invested in AI infrastructure through AWS, could indirectly benefit from this tighter export control since U.S. cloud providers might now have a competitive edge in accessing top-tier Nvidia hardware.

As expected, NVDA’s intraday swings have been intense. While tracking its movements, I’ve also been through Bitget’s “Stock Futures Rush” event. They’re currently running a $250,000 pool in tokenized $TSLA shares for active stock futures traders. I’ve been testing out pairs like NVDAUSDT and TSLAUSDT there.. mostly to see how tokenized stock futures behave around news-driven volatility like this. Liquidity and execution have been smoother than I expected, especially considering how new this market still is.

I’m still on the fence about how far tokenized equities will go, but it’s been interesting to see crypto-native platforms trying to mirror real equity sentiment in real time. The overlap between traditional stock news (like Trump’s AI policy) and tokenized market reactions is becoming more noticeable.

Anyone else here has tried trading tokenized stock futures or sees potential in these crossover markets. Do you think restrictions like this could actually strengthen U.S.-based AI firms long-term, or will they just push China to double down on domestic chip development?",41,8,1762183283.0,2025-11-03T15:21:23+00:00,t3_1onek60,stocks

33,NVDA,"Trump says China, other countries can't have Nvidia's top AI chips","Nov 2 (Reuters) - Artificial intelligence giant Nvidia's (NVDA.O), opens new tab most advanced chips will be reserved for U.S. companies and kept out of China and other countries, U.S. President Donald Trump said.
During a taped interview that aired on Sunday on CBS' ""60 Minutes"" program and in comments to reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump said only U.S. customers should have access to the top-end Blackwell chips offered by Nvidia, the world's most valuable company by market capitalization.

""The most advanced, we will not let anybody have them other than the United States,"" he told CBS, echoing remarks made earlier to reporters as he returned to Washington from a weekend in Florida. ""We don't give (the Blackwell) chip to other people,"" he said during the flight.
The remarks suggest Trump may impose tighter restrictions around cutting-edge American AI chips than U.S. officials previously had indicated, with China and potentially the rest of the world barred from accessing the most sophisticated semiconductors.

In July, the Trump administration released a new artificial intelligence blueprint seeking to loosen environmental rules and vastly expand AI exports to allies, in a bid to maintain the American edge over China in the critical technology.
And just last Friday, Nvidia said it would supply more than 260,000 Blackwell AI chips to South Korea and some of the country's biggest businesses, including Samsung Electronics (005930.KS)

Questions have also swirled about whether Trump would allow shipments of a scaled-down version of Blackwell chips to China since August, when he suggested he might allow such sales.
Trump told CBS he would not allow the sale of the most advanced Blackwells to Chinese companies, but he did not rule out a path for them to obtain a less capable version of the chip. ""We will let them deal with Nvidia but not in terms of the most advanced,"" he said during the ""60 Minutes"" interview.

The possibility that any version of Blackwell chips might be sold to Chinese firms has drawn criticism from China hawks in Washington, who fear the technology would supercharge China's military capabilities and accelerate its AI development.
Republican Congressman John Moolenaar, who chairs the House Select Committee on China, said such a move ""would be akin (to) giving Iran weapons-grade uranium.""

Trump had hinted he might discuss the chips with Chinese President Xi Jinping ahead of their summit in South Korea last week, but ultimately said the topic did not come up.
Nvidia has not sought U.S. export licenses for the Chinese market because of Beijing's stance on the company, CEO Jensen Huang said last week.
""They've made it very clear that they don't want Nvidia to be there right now,"" he said during a developers' event, adding that it needed access to China to fund U.S.-based research and development.

Looking for a bit of education on what drives share price over the long term. Usually people answer this by saying it’s the fundamentals. I assume this means things like revenue, EPS, dividends, growth trends etc. but this doesn’t seem to match up in real life. 
Is it that fundamentals are no longer the thing you should focus on for the long term (has the market changed)?
Or is it that the market is just out of whack (big bubble on some crazy stocks)?

301,NVDA,China and Taiwan,"I'm sure everyone knows that TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) produces most of the worlds semiconductors. This includes quite possibly the most important company in the US stock market right now, NVIDIA.

Basically the economy of the United States and many other countries depends on this one company. This especially applies to the stock market where for instance NVIDIA itself makes up 8% of the S&amp;P 500. And while NVIDIA and other companies have been trying to use other manufacturers in more recent times like Samsung. TSMC is still the most efficient and most used.

Many analysts suggest that China will invade Taiwan before 2030 (2027 likely) due to many factors like China's aging population. I think it goes without saying there is at least a lot of evidence for this. (ie : the special purpose barges they're building  + all their military drills)

Recently the Trump administration has been striking boats off the coast of Venezuela and there are talks of military strikes on the country. Additionally, Trump has just made a post talking about the possibility of sending troops to Nigeria. In the beginning of the year Trump had other aspirations like potentially annexing Greenland and taking back the Panama Canal. While this has all been happening internal division within the US has only gotten worse (shown by the current 2nd longest government shutdown in history) and the fate of 42 million Americans who receive SNAP benefits is still largely undecided, which will only worsen this issue. Due to all of this I feel the US is spreading itself thin especially militarily.

This is the exact enviroment China would want before they invade Taiwan because they know the US will respond. They might even preemptivley strike US military bases at the start of the invasion to slow our response. In my opinion this is why they've interfered with our elections in recent years; to keep the US angry and divided so our government is more distracted when they strike. You don't just go up against the world's #1 military with no plan. 

If everything goes according to plan and China is able to take Taiwan there are many different things that could happen to TSMC. At the very worst analysts suggest that China could just destroy their semiconductor factories. Another possibility is that TSMC activates their kill switch to prevent their facilities from falling into the hands of China. Obviously no one can tell the future exactly but this still paints a very grim picture for me. 

To me this seems like the thing that will pop the AI bubble. After all big tech companies can't function without semiconductors. Currently there is a US plant being built in Arizona but it's only producing 4 nm chips as of now. Additionally as seen with other companies just because they've built the necessary facilities does not mean they'll be able to produce chips at the necessary rate. There are many supply chains that will need to be set up and many specialized workers that will need to gather experience before the plant is as efficient as it needs to be. Over time the US and other countries will create their own manufacturing facilities and set up new supply chains with countries like Korea, who is the 2nd largest producer of semiconductors. However, the intial impact is predicted to be pretty devastating.

Honestly I'm confused why people don't bring this up more often at least as a possibility seeing how our entire economy/stock market basically relies on this one company to function.

41,NVDA,SHORT SQUEEZE THEORIES - BYND AND BEYOND + SQUEEEEZE HISTORY,"Ahoy, fine folks!

I might've done it again, chasing that white whale Moby Dick as crazy Captain Ahab, and once again lost to it, possibly. My Moby Dick = True Short Squeeze.

So I figured I'd write a review of recent events and some of my Short Squeeze theories.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

**A. MY/A BRIEF HISTORY OF SHORT SQUEEZES:**

A1. My entry into GME (GameStop) - The beginning:

My stockplaying career began 8-10 months after the legendary GME short squeeze that culminated January 2021. I read a ton about it with fascination. I believe it was November/December 2021 when I went all-in into GME because it moved nicely. Many thought MOASS (Mother of all short squeezes) was beginning. Well, just a fake-out and shortly after entering, it dropped, I was down a lot. I decided to HODL.

Then as it went up a lot early 2022 I saw profits and instead of HODLING, I started swing trading it as I noticed it was following a pattern most days. I made roughly 4k dollars per month doing this, while waiting for the MOASS...

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

A2. BBBY (Bed Bath and Beyond):

...Until I stumbled upon the Shortsqueeze subreddit, just in time to read about BBBY.

I won't go into full BBBY saga detail, though it's a fascinating story full of conspiracies (allegedly).

My BBBY ride began with the huge rise, August 2022. Jumped almost all-in with my GME investment at like 7ish dollars, up to 25+ dollars. With my GME swinging and that BBBY pump/squeeze, I had effectively doubled my wealth. Glorious.

Then I went all in for round two, the hyped up earnings predicted to show a turnaround plan. Well... earnings were lackluster. Show positives showed future hope, but the market reacted with... halving my investment.

BUT I remained hopeful of squeeze or rise. Largely due to Reddit's creative abilities to spin theories sounding plausible.

BBBY didn't burn my cash instantly, it was a rollercoaster and the stock pumped pretty hard, twice. But the BBBY cult were certain of a looming Short Squeeze. Theories flourished about turnaround plans: Like Ryan Cohen, with GameStop, would eventually do a M&amp;A (Merger &amp; Acquisition) of BBBY. Why? Speculations that Ryan Cohen would turn GameStop into an online store, vastly expand inventory and eventually rival Amazon! GameStop did actually start selling electronics and stuff beyond just games, so it seemed legit. The theorized reasons for buying BBBY, was largely to acquire their massive warehouses and transportation infrastructure/contacts, fitting the narrative of GameStop's expansion.

No true Short Squeeze happened. The leadership seemed either incompetent or theories suggests corrupted by the shorters to deliberately bankrupt the company. Me and the BBBY cult lost a lot of money.

Here I learned a couple of important core stock market lessons. We'll review LESSON 1-3 eventually.

But first, I like to make two points regarding BBBY:

1. There was a huge gamma squeeze lined up in January 2023, with massive options chains waiting to get ignited, which everyone was betting on would trigger the Short Squeeze. Let's call this **EVENT A1**.
2. BBBY did pump hard TWO times in 2023:

One pretty heavy hype pump the week before the gamma squeeze event, which saw hype so massive that BBBY went up enough to have a market cap high enough to even be allowed on WSB subreddit, with the hype spreading there, a gamma squeeze short squeeze seemed certain, so I held... into an obviously failed event.

The second was this seemingly random pump some months later. Let's call this **EVENT A2**.

We'll review these **EVENTS A1-2** later on...

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

A3. FFIE/FFAI (Faraday Future Intelligent Electric):

...Onto my next disaster. I discovered the stock then called FFIE (now it's FFAI), summer of 2023. Prospects looked interesting. In a few months they would fire up their factory and start producing cars, after suffering heavy sabotaging:

(-Insane shorting - Which I learned later.)

\-Employees had received death threats (which FBI investigated).

\-They denied widespread rumours of imminent bankruptcy (including rumours that the leadership deliberately aimed for bankruptcy), scaring away investors. The countered with a horde of lawyers/investigators who confirmed that no evidence could be found of a bankruptcy plan AND that the company was definitely heading towards production and wanted to sell cars.

I thought it looked interesting, storywise and super cheap below 1 dollars, so I put money into it.

I was ignorant when FFIE dropped news of finally having produced and sold a handful of their FF91 cars... yet share price dropped? I realized then, they were a HEAVY shorting target by mostly hedge funds, just like GME and BBBY, with shorters heavily betting on bankruptcy.

\*\*\*\*\*

SIDE NOTE 1 - The bankruptcy shorting plan:

I should mention that Hedge Funds/shorters in cases like this, among others, are heavily shorting the shit out of company stocks when it looks like companies are heading towards inevitable bankruptcy. Because IF a company goes bankrupt and their stock taken off the stock market, the shorters won't have to close their short positions and can make millions/billions of dollars from such situations.

I'll discuss this in another post as it's pretty wild stuff with conspiracy theories and all that goodness. The well goes DEEP, yo!

\*\*\*\*\*

FFIE's story has similar plot elements to BBBY and GME, and being yet another fascinating story if you dig through it properly. But not going into full detail here and I'll try to summarize this rollercoaster ride for me:

I remained thinking that if they sell cars, it would counter the shorting. But it kept declining. One day it was actually rising, so I entered a little more. Minutes after it crashed, because of news of a Reverse Split (RS). Which only made it drop even more. Sigh.

Heading into summer 2024 the FFIE share price was reduced to 0.0700 dollars or so. I put a bit more money into it because I awaited news of car sales. Didn't happen. Production had stopped. FFIE out of money, because RS had failed, dilution = worthless and heavy shorting had once more crashed the stock. FFIE = DOOMED!

Then something happened, one of my many INSANELY UNLUCKY stock events. Guess what? Some remember May 2024 when the FFIE stock price surged from 0.0XX dollars to ALMOST 7000% in four days, I believe almost to 3 dollars from pennies. And me? I had pulled my few thousand shares due to an overdue electric bill two days pre-squeeze. Had I kept my position I would've been up like 15k dollars. I had time to say ""fuck it"" to the electric bill and re-entered in time to make around 800 dollars. Woop... At least something I guess?

The FFIE (long) ""short"" story escalated and an FFIE cult formed on Reddit, with hype of an FFIE Short Squeeze, while the company seemingly re-animated by necromancy and postponing the imminent bankruptcy into substantial glimmers of hope!

Enter a propaganda war where actual hedge fund agents entered FFIE subreddits attempting to create FUD and plant doubts among investors.

Some ingredients also supported a potential proper Short Squeeze. Hype and propaganda war was intense. Enter another rollercoaster where the share price fluctuated, a couple of massive spikes from the UAE investor rumours.

We'll return to the FFIE ""Climax"" soon, including an **EVENT A3**...

\*\*\*\*\*

SIDE NOTE 2 - My expanded stock ambitions:

I spent most of my free time researching and analyzing the stock market, not just meme-stocks and short squeezes, I vastly broadened my horizons.

BUT I was still questing for Short Squeezes and intensely studied theories, mechanics and historical Squeezes, aiming at skills to predict when they could occur.

Parallel to that I was getting pretty good at analyzing stocks with real growth potential and it was during this period that I founded my other subreddit for stock playing and started posting analysis about stocks and pointing out potential quick/short term play candidates.

My medium/long term candidates had an excellent hitrate, I believe like 80% of my such favourites ended up with massive results. To mention a few:

\-EOSE - Eos Energy Enterprises: Wrote analysis, suggest over and over around 1.5 dollars (recently peaked over 18).

\-RR - Richtech Robotics: Strongly pointed at it from 0.5 dollars (recently peaked at over 7).

\-SERV - Serve Robotics: It surged hard after the midas touch from NVIDIA and it ran like crazy like over 200% I believe in just one day. BUT I had read some DD about it and did a little research on my own, I suggested a potential of reaching 20-40 dollars. People laughed at that. Then it flew, wobbly, volatile, but after a few weeks it DID peak at 24 fucking dollars!

\-RCAT - Red Cat - One of my earliest suggested favourites, from like 1-1.3 dollars. I wrote some analysis about RCAT and pointed at the rumours of upcoming military contracts and putting a price target of over 4 dollars. A contract became reality and it went slightly above 4 dollars. More contracts came (recently peaked over 16).

That's to mention a few of my hits. Had I actually listened to my own advice and kept my investments in them, I might've been close to a dollar millionaire today. So I figured here's a good intermission to give three of my CORE stock playing lessons:

\*\*\*\*\*

SIDE NOTE 3 - Three lessons:

1. ALL-IN YOLO!

Never go all-in with more than you can afford to lose, no matter how good it seems. Example: Even a company seemingly guaranteed to gain huge profits COULD see some accident! Like a factory fire disaster, ruining most production? The stock would plummet. Point is, accidents and mistakes can occur even to the best of companies. Plus there might be things going on behind closed doors not revealed to the public/official reports until AFTER such things have have caused company damage. So in fact, never go all-in PERIOD! Diversify!

2. PATIENCE!

When playing medium/long term holds, especially when betting towards rumours of upcoming contracts and future prospects of ramped up productions, use patience. Trust me, I know all too well how attractive it can be to try and play volatile quick fire rockets, spikes, jumps, potential short squeezes. But riding those can be hard and unpredictable. Suddenly you're +2k dollars up on a rocket in just a few minutes, but then suddenly you're -500 dollars because it crashed in just 5 seconds. Keep your investments diverse among low risk/medium risk/higher risk and only some into high risk super high reward. Perhaps also other platforms, like different funds, different stocks, perhaps crypto and perhaps even real life GOLD bars. Diversify!

3. TAKE FUCKING PROFITS!

When playing something volatile that is running nicely or even super hard (like BYND a few days ago) then take profits on the way up. My suggestion is that when the share price is peaking, you should have around or less than 50% of your position left and have locked in a lot of profits. THEN while it can look really tempting to re-enter after it peaks, dips, and looks like it's gonna go again... Try battle those impulses because a lot of time it'll just get shorted down or crashing on its own HARD before regaining momentum, just like with BYND a few days ago. So even if you consider re-entering if it looks fueled up and ready for another go, wait A LITTLE longer than you normally would, it's better to risk losing out on some profits, than to enter and crash!

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

A4. BYND (Beyond Meat)

Needless to say, I suck at following my lessons/advice. Let's summarize the (fake) ""meat"" of this theory post, my BYND ride:

I had my eyes on BYND for quite some time, knowing that it was one of the most heavily shorted stocks. So I suspected a pump was gonna happen (we'll show my pump theory soon). On Friday October the 17th, I entered at 0.66 dollars.

Then you know what happened: Monday UP! Tuesday UP! Wednesday ROCKET!

Reddit suggested the hype was BEYOND (meat) BBBY and FFIE! So the stupid White Whale called to my hunter senses once more... I had sold most above 7 dollars and some on the way up. Was up 1100%ish.

I waited for BYND to dip a little bit and re-entered, in hopes of the seemingly huge potential for a proper Short Squeeze.

Then it dipped hard, again and again... down only 400-500% profits. Still damn good for a few days.

Then Reddit hyped up Short Squeeze potential even harder and especially hyping up this Friday October the 24th, due to the massive Options Chain that could trigger a Gamma Squeeze which could trigger the real Short Squeeze.

In theory the Reddit hype wasn't wrong. Mechanically it could work. My previous analysis post about the BYND situation suggested that the shorts HADN'T covered during this huge run of +1100%.

In my post I didn't mention the Options Chain with Gamma Squeeze potential... Because I've been there before and gotten burned by such ""events"" several times.

So let me transition into another intermission (SOON THEORY I SWEAR)...

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

**B. HIGH RISK HIGH REWARD VOLATILE STOCKPLAYS DEFINITION INDEX:**

Firstly I wanna define some types of volatile stocks. The recent BYND run from 0.5 dollars to 7.69 dollars in just four days, was NOT a short squeeze (I believe). Let's index definitions:

B1. SHORT SQUEEZE: A huge surge in price of a heavily shorted stock, sometimes caused by some catalyst (usually the company suddenly doing a turnaround and avoiding previously seemingly inevitable bankruptcy), then quick hype (likely Reddit hype) which spreads the word of the squeeze across subreddits and even other social media platforms, causing a flood of people to buy into the squeeze hype.

If a successful short squeeze happens, it means that the shorts get desperate with the share price surging and feeling forced to quickly close their short positions before the price go out of control and when they quickly close their short positions when the price is already rising, it fuels the share price surge and causing it to properly rocket to the moon, or at least the stratosphere if the Short Interest was moderately high but not insanely high.

Theoretically if retail collectively hold a majority of the float and keep holding without selling, the price of the stock could rise expontentially with no real upper limit, so yes the theory of MOASS where the price rise to $1000 or $100000 or even a million dollars per share (or higher) is real... In theory (but highly unlikely).

Examples of successful true Short Squeezes:

\-Wolkswagen in 2008 (The OG grandfather)

\-GameStop in 2021 (The modern day OG that popularized the concept)

\-AMC in 2021 (POSSIBLY?\*)

\*I'll touch on AMC later on.

\*\*\*\*\*

Those are some of the most famous ones. Plenty of minor ones has occurred, and some MIGHT'VE been large Short Squeezes. We got the infamous MLGO - MicroAlgo which potentially Short Squeezed like 3-4 times in a year? Also HOLO - Microcloud Hologram which did some insane Short Squeezes a few times? Or did they?

\*\*\*\*\*

B2. SHORT PUMPS (Did I invent this term? IDK and IDC): When heavily shorted stocks, often out nowhere, suddenly pumps hard and see massive surges. My theory is that these pumps occur whenever the shorts are forced to cover large short positions. Usually seen when stocks are trending downwards, suggesting heavy shorting that gradually lower them, then these pumps happen once in a while, but in the grand scheme, the stock is still going down. Whenever these pumps happen, there are naturally quite a few retail/investors that jump on the ride, but not enough volume/hype to drive them into proper Short Squeezes. I theorize it was what ACTUALLY happened to these examples:

\-MLGO - MicroAlgo's several huge short squeezes that saw the price rocket up to like 500-1000% in just a few days, were probably Short Pumps and not Short Squeezes. It was one of the most shorted stocks for a long time.

\-HOLO - Microcloud Hologram probably saw these Short Pumps as well, but the biggest ones were potentially real Short Squeezes due to how extremely high they reached before crashing. It was also heavily shorted for a long time.

\-BYND - Beyond Meat being the stock on most people's mind right now. If you look at the graph of its decline in recent time (past couple of years), you can see that it's done several decent pumps. And being one of the most shorted stocks on the market, I speculate that those pumps have been shorts covering bulk positions, just to keep shorting it, as it has been trending steadily downwards despite those several big pumps.

\*\*\*\*\*

B3. ROCKETS: When a stock surges quickly, often reaching between +50% to over +300% in the matter of hours or a couple of days. I speculate they most frequently occur when the company drops some huge catalyst news or solid rumours of a great upcoming catalyst flows. Has a tendency to quickly crash after peaking. Can probably be sustained by shorts covering because their target is suddenly definitely not going bankrupt, but not enough shorting juice to cause even a Short Pump.

\*\*\*\*\*

B4. HYPE/CATALYST RUNS: When news or hype (or other strong catalyst) is so great/intense that it causes the stock to surge several hundreds % over a few days, sometimes a couple of weeks or more. Which is what I believe this recent +1100% run of BYND was over four days (albeit an unusually insane such run). Hype Runs could be potential triggers of short squeezes. More sustained such runs have been Biotech stocks whose medical product(s) clear Phase 2 or preferably Phase 3 trial levels. Phase 4 is when the product actually hit the markets.

\*\*\*\*\*

B5. SPIKES: Quick bursts that go sky high and are generally over within minutes or like 15-60 minutes at most, in general. Difficult to predict, super risky to ride, but oh so tempting to try. Sometimes you can go in and out in a quickie to make a few decent bucks and usually instead get burned as they crash the moment you enter.

\*\*\*\*\*

B6. PUMP N DUMPS: These can be anything between Spikes, Hype Runs and Rockets. Usually massive and usually over quite quickly and usually driven by hype and promises of Short Squeezes or greater runs, but the instigators quickly leave once it reaches high enough levels, causing more profit takers to sell off, causing panic sellers to sell off, causing stop losses to trigger and usually leaving a large amount of bag holders. Beware the PnDs.

\*\*\*\*\*

Okay, so that's an index of High Risk (usually highly volatile) High Reward plays, other stock type definitions are not really relevant here. If you have suggestions for other definitions or better name suggestions, feel free to comment those.

(I guess Mystery Moon-ing China Stocks could also be its own category, as we've had at least a couple of instances where some random Chinese companies' stocks surged several thousand % in short time and for no apparent reason.)

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

**C. MY MODERN DAY SHORT SQUEEZE THEORY (FINALLY):**

Let's face it, according to the above definitions, there hasn't been many true Short Squeezes. There has been several minor ones for sure, where the Short Squeeze rocketed like 100-300% and was then over. But the massive ones? Perhaps only three proper Short Squeezes ever? Meaning Wolkswagen, GameStop and AMC? If AMC even was a Short Squeeze\*.

C1. AMC CONSPIRACY HYPOTHESIS:

\*Let's quickly go over my (POSSIBLY?\*) status for AMC being a Short Squeeze. It definitely rocketed from 2 dollars to like 70+ dollars seemingly similar to the GME Short Squeeze a few months prior. (To avoid confusion: Since then there has been Reverse Splits AND dilutions messing up the data on the graphs and I believe they currently show that AMC reached over 600 dollars from like 12 dollars, but at the time pre-RS it was around from 2 to 70 dollars)

Here's a wild claim that many people are gonna give me shit for, or at least they used to, perhaps nowadays more people are onboard with my theory: I strongly believe the conspiracy theory that AMC was a diversion, a distraction and a fabricated ""Short Squeeze"" that was deliberately allowed to happen by the Hedge Funds/Shorters.

Why? To Divide and Conquer. After the GME Short Squeeze, the interest into making GME MOASS became huge, the hype was strong and apes gathering to squeeze the shit out of GME. In 2021 it's quite possible that the MOASS could've happened. BUT ""conveniently"" the AMC Short Squeeze happened mid-2021. A massive effect that had was: Two cult camps forming, the AMC apes and the GME apes.

I'm sure you can see where this theory is going: By drawing a huge crowd into AMC instead of GME, they could greatly reduce the threat of GME squeezing again.

NOTE: The AMC conspiracy is just a hypothesis, not facts nor even really a theory. Some evidence and arguments supporting it, but no solid proof I guess. There are several factors supporting this, but that's also for another post.

\*\*\*\*\*

C2. GME/MOASS DISCUSSION:

I'll be fair and point out that when RoaringKitty/DeepFuckingValue suddenly re-emerged in 2024 and his HUGE amount of calls created such hype that it caused GME to rise to 90 dollars, which could've been a trigger into the Options Chain which could've triggered and sustained another Short Squeeze and even potentially the MOASS, suddenly GameStop and Ryan Cohen decided to massively dilute the stock and thus suppressing the price back into the 20-30s dollars range.

Perhaps that killed the hope of MOASS once and for all? On the other hand, Cohen then caused GameStop to suddenly have a pile of like 5 billion dollars and debt free and as such secured GameStop's future as a company (probably). Which could at least cause the GME price to naturally climb higher in the future making it a solid long term investment? Perhaps Cohen actually DIDN'T want the MOASS to trigger?

(SIDE NOTE: I'm not sure I want a proper MOASS to trigger. A massive Short Squeeze that could bankrupt some Hedge Funds, sure, that would be lovely. But a MOASS could spiral out of control and bankrupt financial institutions beyond those main Hedge Funds with heavy short positions and TL;DR: Potentially crash the global economy, which could be over 100+ times worse than the 2008 bank crash.)

\*\*\*\*\*

C3. FAILED SHORT SQUEEZES:

So why do the Short Squeezes, at least the ones with the highest potential of becoming huge, keep failing despite massive hype that possibly rival the hype that 2021 GME and AMC saw way back then? BBBY failed, FFIE failed, GME and AMC has failed since 2021 and I know there are a few other attempts that also failed. The most success we've seen when it comes to Short Interest, are those seemingly random massive Short Pumps occasionally of the most heavily shorted stocks AND now here we are, with BYND... The question on many people's lips is: Did BYND already fail or does it still have potential of becoming a Short Squeeze?

\*\*\*\*\*

C4. CRITERA/INGREDIENTS FOR SHORT SQUEEZE POTENTIAL:

\-SHORTINTEREST: Really high Short Interest (SI) - According to Fintel, BYND had over 60% SI when it ran to 7.69 dollars a few days ago. I suggested that the shorts INCREASED their SI to suppress the Hype Run rather than covering during that run and a couple of days ago when Fintel updated SI it said 160%(!) while Ortex said over 100% SI, suggesting I was correct - This point for BYND = CHECK...

...Or is it? Now suddenly a day after Fintel's figure of 160% SI, it now says 14.52%... WTF?\*

\*Other sources keep suggesting the SI is high as fuck, between 50-100%. Could it be that Fintel adjusted due to Beyond Meat's dilution of the stock with like 300 million shares? Some sources suggest those shares are NOT counted in the public float and locked up for investors who would need to sell them for them to enter the float. What is right and what is wrong?

\-BANKRUPTCY LOOMING/TURNAROUND/CATALYSTS: A company being shorted to hell, the stock sprice reduced to pennystock levels, usually seemingly having the company heading towards bankruptcy and bleeding money and often heavily in debt. Then Short Squeeze potential can arrive if the company is suddenly doing a turnaround - BYND = CHECK.

Beyond Meat diluted the stock before the this Hype Run, raised enough capital to clear 97% of their debt, have recruited business turnaround experts into their high ranks, have already started their turnaround plan with re-branding itself to a broader vegan perspective and not just focusing on ""fake-meat"" products with new interesting vegan products (in addition to some new fake-meat products that I've heard pretty good reviews about: Vegan steak and hamburgers). Official statement = No bankruptcy imminent!

\-HYPE AND ATTENTION: Generally Short Squeezes require enough and attention among investors/retail to make the price surge by massive BUYING AND HOLDING - BYND = CHECK.

What got me interested in the BYND Short Squeeze potential, was the massive levels of hype it's gotten in the past week. BBBY was initally quite large, but largely contained to the BBBY subreddit, Short Squeeze subreddit and at one point spilled over into WSB, but all that wasn't enough in the end. FFIE saw largely similar levels of hype, but probably less than BBBY though the prospects for the company to succeed were (and surprisingly still are) larger than BBBY's.

Aaand the BYND hype has been spammed across over a dozen subreddits and spilled over into other social media and the volume post-Hype Run was still massive! Which is why I let my impulses get myself back into BYND with the hopes of a Short Squeeze. But now I'm second guessing myself. Well, at least I wish I had taken my profits when it peaked and then WAITED longer than I did before re-entering. Then I would've had like at last 4 times the amount of shares that I can currently afford (Yes, I've temporarily exited BYND).

On Monday 20th Oct, we saw like 800+ mil in BYND volume? Tuesday 21st Oct, we saw I believe over 1.1 BILLION in volume and on Wednesday 21st Oct, we saw a staggering 2.2 BILLION volume (which when you calculate the value ratio of the stock being 3-7.69 dollars with 2.2 Bil volume compared to like 1-3 dollars with 1.1 Bil volume the day before, then the Wednesday volume was technically EVEN higher than the amount of shares traded suggests).

Then on Thursday we saw a surge early market and then mostly a rather steep downfall the rest of the day, with like 800 mil volume and then came the super hyped up Friday, which saw over 700 mil volume aaaaand... it was an utter failure... Or was it? Let's call this **EVENT A4**.

\*\*\*\*\*

C5. MODERN ERA SHORT SQUEEZE MECHANICS:

Lots of people hyping the stocks with Short Squeeze potential, consistently bring up various mechanics that worked historically, plus some other rather irrelevant data (that admittedly seems potent, but due to the complexity of the short squeeze mechanics, especially nowadays, render many of those points useless).

Let's start with historical references:

\-Callbacks to the GME/AMC mechanics. Those were successful because:

1. It was unexpected and ""new"", and the Hedge Funds were caught with their pants down. There has to my knowledge not been any real Short Squeeze attempts between Wolkswagen 2008 and GME in 2021. But thanks to the power of internet, vast numbers of investor nerds on forums and social media, they managed to collaborate and co-ordinate the GME Short Squeeze and voilá, striking fear into Wall Street giants. Suddenly their methods of draining the markets of funds through their illegal and foul methods of market manipulation had been turned against them. Hence a reason why I strongly believe that AMC was deliberately allowed to happen, to separate the retail ape potential into two camps to buy some time to come up with methods of countering Short Squeezes.
2. The collaboration and hype was even more more massive back then than with the potential Short Squeezes in the past few years. Let's face it, WSB is nowadays a pretty shitty subreddit (with rumours of corrupt mods) but it's always been rather huge with millions of users. AND during GME Squeeze the hype spread beyond WSB into OTHER forums/social media. Since then, every Short Squeeze attempts has been hyped on smaller subreddits and TRYING to spill INTO WSB, with some minor success at couple of times, but even though there being over a dozen fairly big stock subreddits involved in this BYND hype, all those collectively are still MUCH smaller than the 16 million WSB user numbers. Granted, a lot of WSB users did get involved in BYND, but posts there were instantly removed, the only posts I've seen stay up were either Gain or Loss Porn from BYND, but no real sustained WSB hype.

I also believe WSB in general is not just bigger, but also has some pretty big wallets, judging various posts of loss/gain porn.

3. Mechanics that worked back then does not work now. Here's perhaps the most important Short Squeeze lesson to be learned: The Hedge Funds shorting the shit out of these stocks are not stupid. They may be assholes, but they are probably run by some decently intellectual people (who at least understand the stock market and business) who can learn and adapt. They've developed new ""weapons"" of shorting to heavily counter Short Squeezes, which seem almost invincible at times (hint: They're not really.)

One such shorting weapon is Naked Shorting. Over the years many sceptics suggested that Naked Shorts were a myth, a conspiracy theory etc. But there are two HUGE factors that suggets otherwise:

\-Factor One: The vast amounts of FTDs that keep occurring on heavily shorted stocks especially whenever Short Squeeze cults hype them up.

FTDs = Fail To Deliver(s). When you short a stock with short lending, the one betting on the short sort of borrow a share for the current price and then must later return it within the current ""return time window"" which can fluctuate. If the share price was 2 dollars upon borrowing the short share, and upon returning the share the share price has gone down to 1 dollar, the shorter effectively made 100% profits on that 2 dollar bet as they only have to pay 1 dollar in the end. Each instance of shorting has the effect of the share price going down. Officially it's just meant to be a mechanic allowing investors to make money even if the market is crashing. When a shorting happens without a share being borrowed, an FTD is created. Basically an IOU for the shorts. Interesting mechanics for another post.

\-Factor Two: ETF shorting and the fact that Reg Sho is always useless during such events. I won't dig into these in this post, as it's already long enough. Also topics for another post.

The fact of the matter is that the hedge funds seemingly always win the huge hype wars when proper true short squeezes seem highly possible. The only short squeezes that are allowed to happen are smaller ones. They obviously have much more shorting ""tools"" in their arsenal these days than they had during the 2021 GME squeeze.

This is why I wasn't too optimistic about Friday the 24th's hype regarding the massive Options Chain that would've triggered a Gamma Squeeze this coming week if the Calls got their strike levels. Because I've seen this before several times. We've had just as juicy Options Chains that screamed ""GAMMA SQUEEZE IMMINENT"" many times with GME, AMC, BBBY and combos between them.

Each time, much hype, and during that Jan 2023 BBBY Options Chain Hype, the BBBY stock had risen HIGH the week prior and suddenly it was worth over the minimum Market Cap to be discussed on WSB, so even a lot of WSB joined in... But the price was still suppressed to just a few cents below the Gamma Squeeze Max Pain levels to ignite it. I think I recall that the Ignition price for Max Pain was like 3 dollars or something, and the share price was kept at like 2.95 dollars when trading day closed, so nothing happened and the share price dropped....

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

**D....CONCLUSION:**

NOW, let's finally get to my theory. This theory isn't really about the prospects of a real short squeeze, but instead it's about POTENTIALLY inevitable SHORT PUMPS (IF MY THEORY IS CORRECT). My Short Squeeze theory is that massive Short Squeezes are probably doomed to fail because the antagonists just have too powerful shortings weapons these days. Theoretically they're still possible, but I suspect you would need a perfect SQUEEZE STORM of several factors in play at once and that probability is rather low. BUT smaller Short Squeezes do happen once in a while.

But let's focus on the SHORT PUMP theory...

Let's look back at the events:

**EVENT A1: The BBBY Gamma Squeeze that failed. Despite MASSIVE Hype including WSB joining in that January event... the price was kept just below max pain. Clearly the shorts shorted the shit out of the stock.**

**EVENT A2: The random BBBY Pump a few months after EVENT A1. Why did it happen?**

**EVENT A3: Long story SHORT: FFIE evaded delisting from Nasdaq and evaded bankruptcy (again) thanks to voting for investor designated dilution and Reverse Split. One of the rare times where both dilution and RS WEREN'T exactly negative for the stock, it was the only means to survive and thus BULLISH that time. Anyway, it was checkmate for the shorters for that period, because FFIE would survive for a while longer, had new investments and plans and stuff. The EVENT A3 in question was shortly after the RS had finalized. The stock dropped a bit, but much less than expected from an RS. Then suddenly it stopped dropping and started climbing. Curiously I entered because the momentum seemed to accelerate.**

**THEN sudden surge sent the stock flying. It rocketed 100% on that day. Then 100% on the next day. Then it spat out from pre-market pumping hard on day 3 and shortly after started crashing. So what was that sudden three day rocket burst? The hype was largely killed. Some suggest it was a dead cat bouncing, which can happen. Buuuuut, I'm not so sure...**

**EVENT A4: Now enter BYND's ""failed"" Gamma Squeeze on October the 24th. The hype was real, but it was pushed down below every max pain level, even the really low thresholds (the thresholds were like between 2.5-3.5 dollars and around 3 might've triggered a Gamma Squeeze). Clearly it was shorted the shit down, just like BBBY.**

\*\*\*\*\*

So without further ado, MY SHORT PUMP THEORY:

In SHORT regarding the shorts: It seems like that Short Pumps DO occur sometime after the shorters have heavily shorted down and suppressed retail's attempts of causing a Short Squeeze, because they need extreme volumes of shorting to do so, which essentially Super Short Charges (SSC) the stock. And at some point some weeks or even months after the SSC occurs, it will randomly do a Short Pump Jump.

EVENT A1 possibly lead to EVENT A2 where it MIGHT'VE been the shorts closing their heavy short positions from suppressing EVENT A1.

EVENT A3 MIGHT'VE been the shorts quietly closing their massive short positions from having suppressed the stock for a long time when the game was checkmate.

I'll interject with additional data - MLGO - **EVENT X1**:

Another point of evidence to this is MLGO - MicroAlgo. It used to be one of the most shorted stocks on the market and it was notorious to Short Squeezing hard several times in one year. Except I believe those were actually hard Short Pumps, not squeezes. And it moved like I explained earlier, just like BYND: Steadily trending downwards and occasionally doing a big PUMP, but overall going down. Suggesting that my theory is that they continuously heavy short the stock into a steady decline, but once in a while they need to ventilate the SSC which causes one of those Short Pumps (which in MLGO's case sent the stock shooting up 500-1000% each time or so).

I made a post about this on my previous forum, suggesting that MLGO was due for another such Short Pump, considering the still heavy heavy shorting and still going down and it seemed like the Short Pumps happened every 2-4 months consistently, a pattern you could see in other heavily shorted stocks.

Several fake-outs cost me a lot of money. I started thinking that my Short Pump speculation was wrong...

...Fast foward until like March or so this year (2025), when I suddenly received messages on Reddit (I was out of the stock market for months). Some members of my stock forum thanked me for making them rich, pointing to my analysis post about MLGO eventually doing a Short Squeeze/Short Pump. Voilá, MLGO had indeed squeezed over 800% in like 2-3 days.

\*\*\*\*\*

SO judging historical data, it seems like heavy shorting that SSC a stock, requires the stock to ventilate some shorting once in a while, resulting in SHORT PUMPS. The historical data if you review all mentioned stocks and other high profile candidates, seem to suggest that such SSC SHORT PUMPS may occur like between 1-6 months after the initial SSC event or shortly after the shorts try to leave the stock Hype free like with FFIE.

\*\*\*\*\*

Do I think there could be enough hype to fuel a Short Squeeze even if a Short Pump happens happens from EVENT A4 (BYND)? Probably not, unless there's a perfect storm of factors that coincide. Which seems unlikely, but I guess not impossible. But I think there might be a Pumping opportunity to make quite a lot of money at some point perhaps within the next 1-6 months if we're looking historically at BBBY, FFIE and MLGO etc. Perhaps even sooner than that?

I mean, the stock might naturally start climbing once the heavy shorting takes a break if the shorts realize that BYND is probably a lost target, no longer desirable shorting prey, because the most important factor here is that they are seemingly doing a turnaround and no longer heading into bankruptcy. MEANING: The shorts need to close their positions at some point and right now they have SUPER CHARGED BYND by suppressing this recent Hype Run and the Hype for the Friday Gamma Squeeze. So if the stock naturally climbs to like 5 dollars in the near future, then a Short Pump might take it to like 10-20 dollars? Unless they decide to keep shorting it for a while, hoping that retail's interest in the stock will go away, which in turn will only carge the SSC even more, so the Short Pump then might still reach 10-20 dollars even if they keep the stock at like 1-2 dollars.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Anyway, that's just my theory, I could be wrong.

Personally I exited on Friday the 24th when I realized there was no way they were gonna let it ignite the Gamma Squeeze (near the end of the day = Even more profits lost). I'm still up like 100% from my initial entry (Still kicking myself for not taking 1100% profit).

Better to exit and once it's seemingly low enough, I'll probably re-enter in hopes to ride a Short Pump, if nothing else, I like the stock and the company and they seem like a long term hold now and I think we'll at least see a natural climb over time. Perhaps not to their previous 100+ dollars levels, but above 10 dollars? Probably highly likely.

And I would advice the Shorters to exit before the BYND stock climbs too high, because it's only gonna hurt more...

41,NVDA,$POET — The Photon Dealer That You're Missing,"https://preview.redd.it/d4wloobahvyf1.png?width=1917&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9aa04d70d08941aa680b19beb2fe1642e6047ed5

**TL;DR**

POET, a $500M photonics company sitting with real tech and [patents](https://patents.justia.com/assignee/poet-technologies-inc), makes AI servers move at light speed (literally). The AI arms race can’t scale without faster pipes, and POET is literally selling the pipes. Current market cap is peanuts compared to what it could be if even a fraction of this narrative hits. My play: **Jan 16 2026 $10C** for a clean 5x if we tag $10, and **Jan 15 2027 $10C** for the “retire in shameful glory” 10x+ upside. Not financial advise, assess your own risk.

# Why You Should Even Care About $POET?

Alright you smooth-brained degenerates, put down your $NVDA FDs and listen. There’s a sub-$600M photonics company quietly gearing up to feed the AI data-center monster that everyone keeps screaming about. It’s called **POET Technologies**, ticker **$POET**, and they’re building the plumbing that lets GPUs talk to each other at light speed.

Copper is cooked. Every AI chip out there is choking on data bandwidth. POET shows up like “what if photons, bro?” Their secret sauce is this thing called the **Optical Interposer**, which basically crams light and silicon into one chip so data moves faster, cheaper, and cooler. That’s the entire pitch — light good, heat bad, tendies pending.

**Credit: Read** [this DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1lw1ft3/poet_the_10_bagger_you_dont_know_about/) **for more company details if you are new to $POET**.

# Retard Section Begins Here

If you missed $NVDA, $AMD, $AVGO, this is your redemption arc. We’re still early enough that institutions are only starting to load up. If you like stupid asymmetric returns, please read on. Let’s walk through what’s been dropping in just the last month:

* On **October 28**, they closed a **$150M oversubscribed direct offering**. “Oversubscribed” means people were fighting for shares. The new investors didn’t even get a discount — they paid roughly **$7.25/share**, the same as retail. Institutions don’t throw money at a small-cap photonics play for fun. They see growth. \[[source](https://www.poet-technologies.com/news/poet-technologies-announces-closing-of-us-150-million-oversubscribed-registered-direct-offering-of-common-shares)\]
* On **October 22**, they announced a **$5M production order** for their 800G optical engines. That’s not a prototype, that’s an actual order for actual products. The kind of thing that moves them from “science project” to “revenue story.” \[[source](https://www.poet-technologies.com/news/poet-technologies-receives-5-million-production-order-for-800g-optical-engines)\]
* On **October 7**, another **$75M private investment** landed to scale their AI connectivity business. That’s two major capital events in one month. Most penny semis can’t raise pocket change, these guys raised nearly a quarter billion. \[[source](https://www.poet-technologies.com/news/poet-technologies-announces-closing-of-us-75-million-investment-to-accelerate-growth-in-ai-connectivity-solutions)\]
* They’ve also been stacking partnerships very recently — **Semtech**, **Sivers Semiconductor**, plus a handful of industry awards. This isn’t vapor; these are real names in the optics space that actually matter. \[[source 1](https://www.poet-technologies.com/news/poet-technologies-and-sivers-semiconductors-collaborate-on-external-light-sources-for-co-packaged-optics-and-next-generation-ai-market), [source 2](https://www.poet-technologies.com/news/poet-technologies-and-semtech-launch-1-6t-optical-receivers-for-ai-networks)\]

Put all that together, and you get a company moving from hype to execution faster than most of Wall Street can spell “photonics.”

# Technicals and Sentiment

Yeah, the stock dumped about 30% recently. Before you call that a rug, realize every major bullish catalyst hit after that drop. We’re sitting on the lower band of a clean ascending channel. Historically, that’s where the smart money reloads. DO NOT WALK INTO THE BEAT TRAP. Put your seat belts on and ride with smart money.

The community is waking up too. The $POET subreddit grew from **2k visitors to 10k in a month** — that’s not retail noise, that’s early-phase momentum.

https://preview.redd.it/dpkkujubhvyf1.png?width=2536&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc0c97bfe8db784c96b00eb0b64d25b1c59f6aa8

Option flow backs it up. Last run to $9.41 saw **600k calls traded in a single day**. Current put-call open interest ratio sits around **0.07**, which is stupidly bullish for a small-cap. There are over **780k calls** sitting on open interest right now, and open interest has been steady for months at least since June, not just a one-day gamma spike. An once-in-a-lifetime moment is secretly brewing.

https://preview.redd.it/ut4sjvxchvyf1.png?width=2518&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=febff6ad84a2ba6bdd4347cffa5f92a8fa5677f9

Market makers are hedging in a way that creates a positive **GEX (gamma exposure)** setup — meaning the lower it goes, the more they have to buy. We’re under the $7 put wall and facing the $10 call wall. That means dealers will buy back shares to create their hedge. If price breaks $10, hedging could shove this thing straight to $12 or higher. An 85% return in stock price, or multi-bagger for long calls.

https://preview.redd.it/yeviu27ehvyf1.png?width=2458&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ffb856391db297da1fa6a094426dac3727823841

The main risk of the setup is execution and timing. But given the current slew of great news, I'm confident that we are on a very good track.

# Market Tailwinds

Now here’s where it gets even spicier. The macro setup is starting to line up for small-cap revenge season:

* **November is historically a strong month** for equities. Seasonality matters — funds love window-dressing into year-end.
* **Fed rate cuts and the end of QT in December** mean more liquidity sloshing into risk assets. Cash gets bored; bored cash buys small caps.
* **70% of institutional investors are underperforming** this year. They’re desperate to make up ground before Q4 closes.
* That means we’re looking at a **year-end chase** — rotations out of mega-caps and into “what hasn’t run yet.” Small-cap tech fits that bill perfectly if liquidity condition improves.

Combine that macro tailwind with POET’s catalysts, and we’ve got a setup where funds have to chase growth stories like this into the new year.

# The Setup

Right now you’ve got:

* Fundamental catalysts (orders, capital, partnerships).
* A technical setup sitting on support.
* Option flow that looks like someone knows something.
* A small float that can actually move when retail catches on.
* Macro market tailwinds.

Target for end of 2025 is **$10–$12**, which puts it around a $1B market cap conservatively. If the photonics hype actually lands and POET keeps landing contracts, $30 by mid-2026 isn’t insane.

This is what asymmetric risk looks like. Worst case you lose your call premium and post memes about it. Best case, you’re the guy who bought the photon dealer before Wall Street figured it out.

# Closing Thoughts

The AI boom doesn’t work without faster data pipes. POET builds the pipes. Institutions are buying. The retail crowd hasn’t caught on. We’re in the dumb zone where the risk looks huge and the reward looks ridiculous — which is exactly where the biggest money gets made. Play it however you want. Just don’t pretend you weren’t warned when this thing lights up like a data-center laser array.

Strategies? Buy Jan 16 2026 $10 call and chill with Jan 15 2027 $10.

If you're hesitant, please wait this turns into a multi-bagger and be like ""OH, I SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT. IT'S ON MY WATCHLIST FOREVER"".

39,NVDA,Some interesting data,"Between the crash of 2000 and the peak of 2008 (before the correction), annual growth of the S&amp;P500 was 18% including dividends.

Between 2009 (post-2008 correction) and 2025, the annual growth has been 15% a year, so less per year but over a much longer period (16 years).

The 2008 financial crisis was a drop of 50% of the S&amp;P500.

Losing gains of the last 4 years would mean a 15% drop for the S&amp;P500.

Average recovery time of the last 4 market crashes was almost 4 years.

If the top 10 largest US valuations (Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple etc.) dropped by 25%, a global index tracker would drop by 5%, the S&amp;P500 would drop by 8%.

For a drop of 50%, a global index tracker would drop by 10%, the S&amp;P500 would drop by 16%.

Of course, if the top 10 largest US valuation dropped by 50%, you would also expect many other companies to drop significantly due to negative sentiment.

My conclusions:

* Don't just invest in the S&amp;P500 if you fear the top 10 US valuations are very inflated (AI bubble). A global index tracker would soften the blow a bit
* If you don't want to be forced to sell at a loss, have at least 4 years of cash/near cash",172,46,1762069851.0,2025-11-02T07:50:51+00:00,t3_1ombjbd,StockMarket
279,NVDA,I am financially ruined (short selling Korean fried chicken companies),"I have lost everything, and I'm not sure how to continue. This week I lost $472,085 short selling Korean fried chicken companies. My idea was with the declining Korean population, and the recent trend towards healthier eating and vegan diets, there is an opportunity here. I did some research into consumer trends in Korea and determined that this would be a lucrative play. So I shorted Korean Chicken companies across the board.

Unfortunately, earlier this week Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang dined out at a Korean Chicken restaurant called Khanbu Chicken in Seoul, and pictures went viral of him enjoying fried chicken and beer. Stocks of chicken companies in Korea soared 20-30% and I was margin called. Everything is gone.

I don't know how to continue. How could I have not known that Korean fried chicken is the future of artificial intelligence?",18301,1413,1762024502.0,2025-11-01T19:15:02+00:00,t3_1olwc77,wallstreetbets
34,NVDA,What do you think of my risk management strategy?,"We don't know if GOOGL or PLTR or any of the other like NVDA will tank by 50% one not-so fine day. There's a stylized fact that the stock fall returns are significantly higher than stock spike returns. Idea behind my risk management technique is that stocks keep rallying because of money printing or whatever else, until a serious concern arises, which is when they tank by a big percentage, that too within a week. This a tail risk. Usually, downside tail risk is lot higher than upside tail risk.

I will take PLTR as an example. Highly overvalued and if the acceleration of growth is not sustained, the stock will tank. Suppose I have 1000 stocks. I will keep selling 10 lots of covered calls which are deep out of the money. These are weekly options I am talking about. In this case, I'd sell say $240 call options (covered calls). Usually, it just happens that the same moneyness put option would also be priced around the same value. So assuming PLTR is at $200, the puts at $160 strike (same expiry namely weekly) will usually cost the same even though this is not etched in stone.

So selling calls gets me some money, and I can buy puts with that money. All in all, I did not lose anything.

For some reason, if PLTR spikes to $300 in one week, I'd be screwed. This has certainly happened and the main hypothesis behind this strategy is that PLTR stock price would not spike that way in one week. However, stocks are known to tank to like 50% or lower in one day ... let alone a week.

Now when it comes to earnings, I buy a put, but won't sell a covered call. So if the earnings result in a big spike in stock price, I don't want to cap it using the covered call. But outside of this known event, selling covered calls, and buying puts using that money, seems to be a good way to kinda ""protect your investment"" right?

Once again, this risk management ""strategy"" will fail miserably if the stock spikes by 50% or more in one week. Maybe that's has happened in the past, but that's the call people have to make. Can that happen to this particular stock? If not, I will take a bet and use this strategy to mitigate the downside risk.

I think this spending is highly correlated with NVIDIA's revenue growth. Their revenue for 2023 was roughly $32 billion, in 2024 it was 96 billion and expectation is that for 2025 it may reach around $200B. 

Considering that there are other companies that are investing in AI infrastructure (OpenAI, Oracle etc,), and the potential of Chinese companies, should we expect that this cycle of Nvidia's revenue growth may continue?

Another important matter we should consider is that NVIDIA's operating margin has dramatically increased in the last few years and it is not around 60%. So not only their revenue  has been growing exponentially, but they also increase the profit they make from every dollar of revenue. Thoughts?

257,NVDA,These were my short term predictions for the last 9-10 days. This is why you can’t predict the markets.,"I made predictions for all the stocks in my portfolio. In just 10 days, a lot of them aged badly. To myself, and to you investors, don’t try to predict the market. 

My thesis: **Stock Positions 10/20/2025**

 

**GOOG:** **Hold** after earnings when I will likely buy the stock

**NEM:** While **tariffs devalue the U.S. dollar**, Gold is likely to **see record highs**. Interest rates are declining, which creates more inflation which will likely help NEM, which is a Gold miner, and gold miners are cyclical with the price of Gold. As worse data approaches the stock market (which is likely to come) Gold will keep making record highs.

The USD devaluing + Interest rates likely being cut + an overvalued stock market + most other markets being overvalued is likely to allow NEM and Gold to continue to go up.

Even though NEM has a large connection to Gold, NEM still must abide **by regulations** which could drag down the price, even if Gold is going up. Also, my MSR ratio shows NEM at 82/16 odds, which shows that NEM is highly overvalued on the (D) chart on TradingView.

However, NEM has good leadership, and their **debt has reduced by 8.69B to 7.13B** (as of June 2025). Their debt-to-equity ratio is sound at 0.24.

This is why I will **hold** NEM and wait for more earnings which are on Oct 23 2025

**NFLX:** Likely to continue with strong growth through Q3. Many analysts rate NFLX a buy before earnings and are increasing their price targets, especially after the release of some big hits (Squid Game 3, Kpop Demon Hunters). 

However, NFLX has fallen below its 50-day moving average of tomorrow’s earnings report. This should initiate caution to investors.

Q3 has been a very good season for companies in the S&amp;P 500. Out of the index, **12% of companies have had their earnings, with 86% surpassing expectations**. So far, this has been a fantastic quarter. NFLX is a big company and it’s likely to have a beat as well.

Even though Q3 has been a good performance, **NFLX is exposed to the American consumer**, which if they feel the effects of inflation too harshly, might start to cancel their Netflix subscriptions. Also, Donald Trump, the president of the U.S said that he will **put 100% tariffs** on movies outside of the U.S, which would drastically affect NFLX’s profit margins, because **59% of all Netflix revenue comes from international markets.**

Despite this, I believe that NFLX will continue to thrive and will likely beat earnings. This is why I will **buy** some NFLX before earnings tomorrow.

**MU:** Earnings were fantastic. **Revenue surged up to 37.8B, nearly a 49% increase year-over-year.** Analyst targets range from $240 to $270, which is approximately a 20 – 30% upside.

Although a fantastic earnings report, MU plans to **sever its chip business in China** after its ban in 2023 on its products in infrastructure. While it will still supply some things to China, this will likely, over **the long term hurt, revenue and revenue diversification**. MU has also been facing tariff headwinds **after the U.S added 10% universal tariffs** on all imports, which MU has suffered from.

This is why I will **hold** until geopolitical tensions decrease. **If they increase, I will sell a chunk of my position**. I have already made 33% profit at the time of writing.

**UNH:** One of the biggest healthcare / insurance service companies in the U.S, with exposure across insurance (UnitedHealthcare), health services, data and pharmacy benefits. This means it has multiple levers for revenue and margin improvement. It is an established network, relationships with other companies have been built over many decades (since 1977)

**Investors like Warren Buffett and Michael Burry** have invested billions into UNH, seeing it as undervalued from recent highs. However, there is a reason for UNH being valued as ‘undervalued’.

UNH have been facing rising medical costs, utilization and squeezed margins. The company has faced **a lot of uncertainty**, even at one point **suspending its 1-year outlook**. The company has faced **ongoing scrutiny into the investigation of Medicare billing practices and over adjustments**.

This could bring **potential fines, reputational damages or operational constraints**. **The UNH CEO, who was shot in December 2024** caused turmoil in the company. Even though it’s been nine months since the shooting, it has scarred many investors, and customers about why the CEO was shot, and if UNH is doing bad practices at the company.

For these reasons, I will likely **hold** the stock for the foreseeable future.

**JNJ:** The stock has seen a good Q3 report, **sales up 6.8% year over year**. The growth came from its **“Innovative Medicine” and “MedTech”** segments, so its not overly reliant on one division. JNJ is also pushing new therapies into the markets, so its business is diverse.

JNJ also revised down its **tariff expectations from $400M to $200M**, reflecting improved global trade conditions. The reason why I bought JNJ in the first place was because it was reliable and solid. It helped me hedge against market geopolitical volatility.

Even though I like JNJ stock very much, key drugs **like Stelara (which is a big revenue driver) is losing its exclusivity or facing biosimilar competition** which could erode further revenue. After a strong run for JNJ, positive news might be priced in. Some valuation models say that **JNJ might be 4-5% overvalued** relative to its fundamentals.

**In the worst-case scenario**, if a court hands down a massive talc verdict, or series of judgements JNJ could suffer an **earnings shock, cash flow and reputation**. This should keep investors cautioned of the future of JNJ.

I will **hold** JNJ for these reasons until **further** **notice**.

**BABA:** This stock has a lot of exposure to the AI market, **building the ‘compute’ layer**, which is for LLMs. It is e-commerce, but it could expand into technology through this. The stock has rallied in 2025, and some models **suggest that BABA is still undervalued**. BABA has **substantial cash reserves** for extra projects that could fuel revenue growth.

Geopolitical tensions between the U.S and China has made created trouble for BABA. U.S scrutiny **because of U.S national security** concerns has impacted the valuation of the stock. While AI growth is exciting, Alibaba’s traditional services are under margin pressure. China is **dealing with a slowdown in economic growth, property stress and consumer spending being soft in many areas. Trade tensions may disrupt Alibaba**.

Alibaba is also **viewed as a “comeback” and “transformation story”**, so there are high expectations, like any AI stock. Some analysts suggest most of the good news is already priced in.

This is why I am going to **hold Alibaba until 11/21/2025**, when it has its earnings, and then I will do another analysis on the company then.

**TSM:** This stock **manufactures** a large share of all **the most advanced chips in the world**, for big players **like NVDA and AMD**. Because it has such a large share, it has greater area **for growth and revenue expansion**. TSM has a moat in advanced technology which is extremely hard to replicate.

**The accelerating demand for GPUs, AI accelerators, data centre chips, and related semiconductors benefits TSM**. TSM has had strong recent earnings.

The leading edge that TSM has is **extraordinarily** **expensive to maintain**, for a company like TSM. If demand slows, then as the whole operation is so expensive, it could hurt TSM profitability.

Geopolitical situation in Taiwan is delicate, because **if China declares war on Taiwan, the stock will likely drop a lot**. Cybersecurity and hacking is also meaningful in the semi conductor industry.

Competition to remain the company with the most advanced chips is fierce, with Intel saying it will invest 33B euros and Samsung investing 11 – 16B dollars annually.

I believe that TSM will continue to grow (no signs of growth slowing down) but if the AI bubble pops, and as China – US tensions grow (especially over Taiwan and tariffs) an invasion into Taiwan is not off the table. This is why I am cautious of TSMC’s future prospects. I am planning **to hold and buy small chunks** because of this earnings report and because of Post-Earnings-Announcement-Drift which will likely last a few more weeks.

**MS:** The stock recently had a good Q3 performance, with their investment banking **revenue jumping 44% year over year. MS has also been given more flexibility to deploy capital, increase dividends or make investments, because the Federal Reserve has agreed to lower MS’ “stress capital buffer” from 5.1%, to 4.3% for the upcoming year.**

Morgan Stanley is a big company, which has many diversified operations, like asset management, institutional securities, investment banking, trading and other operations which allows for multiple angles to expand revenue.

However, much of their revenue comes from investment banking, so if just a handful of operations underperform, it could **affect MS and drag on profit margins**. MS is also exposed to the health **of credit markets** and the health of corporates, so if credit defaults rise, MS could face losses.

Morgan Stanely would also be hurt, in the worst-case scenario, by a recession. In a recession, deal making, a large revenue driver would be hurt hart, causing a drag on MS. Given the moderate chance by most institutions of a recession coming in 2025/2026, trimming the position of MS might be a good idea. This is why I will **hold** until **recession fears are larger**.

**JPM:** Similar to Morgan Stanley. I will **hold** until recession fears are larger.

**UBER:** Uber has a **diversified business model**, (uber eats, normal driving, and AI services). This helps mitigate the risks associated with any single revenue stream.

UBER faces regulatory scrutiny because of some drivers not being licensed. In Hong Kong, lawmakers have passed a bill to regulate this. **The FTC has taken action against UBER for deceptive billing and cancellation practices related to its subscription, Uber One**. The legal challenge could result in fines and damage to Uber’s reputation. **Uber faces competition from Deliveroo and Just Eat, especially in the U.K.**

This is why I will likely **hold, and if earnings are bad, sell some of my position.**

**SPGI:** Standard and Poor’s. Had a good Q2 performance of 3.755B, a **6% increase year over year. The company also announced a 1.8B acquisition of With Intelligence, a private markets data provider. This will enhance SPGIs offerings, in the rapidly growing private financial market sector. Analysts maintain a “strong buy” rating for SPGI, with a 12-month price target averaging 609$ indicating a potential upside of \~28%.**

SPGI’s valuations are concerning. **The P/E ratio is at 36.3x,** which is above the industry average of 25.7x. DCF model suggest that a fair, closer value is 288$, indicating the stock may be overvalued. Like MS and JPM, market downturns could reduce demand for SPGI services and seeing as a recession has a moderate chance for 2025/2026, this is a possibility.

Even though SPGI has concerning valuations, I think that I will allocate a large amount of money to SPGI before earnings. Right now, it is down -11% in my portfolio, but to me it, it suggests a buying opportunity, and as the stock has gone down a lot, the expectations for Q3 might be lower**. I will buy moderate chunks more SPGI**. Earnings on the 30^(th) of October 2025

**BKNG:** Earnings on the 28^(th) of October 2025. Booking Holdings has demonstrated **good financial results, with revenue growth being in the travel sector. BKNG is diversified, having many brands such as** [**Booking.com**](http://Booking.com)**, Agoda, KAYAK and OpenTable, providing a broad range of services. The company has operations in 220 countries, meaning that it has a strong global presence.**

Booking Holdings is exposed to currency exchange rate volatility, which may impact revenue. BKNG is also very economically sensitive, so in a recession, it is likely to be impacted very hard. An economic downturn is likely not good for BKNG. **The industry is highly competitive, with players like Expedia, Airbnb and other regional platforms wanting market share. BKNG has a beta of 1.35, so it’s more volatile than other stocks.**

For these reasons, I will buy **a small amount of BKNG before earnings.**

**BRK.B:** 70% increase in profits in operating earnings, driven by a substantial rise in insurance.

Berkshire Hathaway has underperformed the S&amp;P 500. I am not holding it to outperform the S&amp;P 500, I am more holding it as a counterweight to more volatile stocks in my portfolio. Warren Buffet stepped down in 2025 which has been an issue for some investors, but I am confident in the leadership of Greg Abel.

BRK.B is a very small position in my portfolio (because of Warren Buffet stepping down, and that turbulence) but the dust has likely settled, so I will **buy large chunks before earnings** (which is on the 3^(rd) of November, 2025).

**DOW:** This stock has a strong history of dividends, which is why I bought it in the first place. It has a diverse revenue stream from multiple angles.

The company is facing many lawsuits over misleading investors that it could withstand tariffs and sustain dividends. Analysts project that DOW **will  have a loss of 0.31$** a share, a significant decline from the same quarter last year, that yielded positive profit per share.

This is why I will likely **hold DOW through earnings, and see where things stand after earnings.**

**OPEN:** Meme stock / speculative. **Hold / Sell before earnings report with the way things are going.**

**AVGO: Strong Q3 performance, revenue of 15.95B, a 22% increase year over year. AI semiconductor revenue has surged to 63% year over year to 5.2B dollars, marking 10 consecutive quarters of growth.**

AVGO has **a high P/E ratio of 89.3**, amidst this AI bubble, which is **worrying investors**. The company has also **had layoffs affecting sales, customer success, and account management roles, including VMware, which it acquired in late 2023. Even though AVGO had strong revenue, the stock still declined 4% following because it was not a good enough earnings report to please investors.**

This is why I am **likely to hold till the next earnings report**.

**NVDA:** Like AVGO, but they work in slightly different areas. **P/E ratio is 52, and the stock will be a hold until earnings.**

That said, I can't help but think at this point and especially looking at the fundamentals that this is substantially overpriced. My thought is to sell 25%, lock in profits, and I can of course buy more assuming there is a massive correction, which I think there will be. 

Flip side is, I have at least 16 years and selling at this low of a price could be leaving money on the table.

**1. Introduction : The Exploding Demand for Optical Bandwidth**

As AI clusters and cloud infrastructure demand more and more networking bandwidth, electronic links in the datacenter are being confined to shorter and shorter distances.

Yet as these datacenters promise to consume exponentially more power to satisfy this massive bandwidth, operators are disaggregating them into disparate physical sites up to hundreds of miles apart in order to reliably deliver them the giga-Watts of power they require and adequately cool them.

Networking infrastructure both within and between datacenters is being increasingly built with photonic links.

For the same reasons -- power, latency and reliability being paramount -- operators are giving renewed attention to optics for datacenter switching in a slow but growing move away from traditional electrical packet switching.

I believe Lumentum ($LITE) is the optical product maker best-positioned to capitalize on these near- and far-term transformations.

**2. The Company : Cloud Revenue Inflecting Upward, Massive Purchase from NVIDIA**

Lumentum earns roughly 90% of its \~$500MM quarterly revenue from its optical transceivers and lasers chips for cloud and networking applications. It earns the remaining 10% from industrial and consumer segments, neither of which are covered here.

Its primary moneymakers are transceivers capable of up to 800G transmission and lasers capable of up to 200G modulation. Its EM Lasers are used as the light source for optical datacenter interconnect (DCI) and its narrow linewidth lasers light up 400ZR and 800ZR coherent optical links capable of 100km transmission. Operators like Meta, Microsoft, and AWS are deploying these 400ZR, 800ZR and eventually 1600ZR coherent links in massive quantities to connect up their datacenters and AI factories. These fiber links are lit by narrow-linewidth lasers, of which Lumentum's are considered best-in-class due to the higher yields on them they realize compared to competitors' lasers, per management commentary. This capability gives the company favorable ""pricing latitude"" and ""price levers"" per the CEO that, per the CFO, would provide further upside to the company's already-improving margins.

Lumentum's experience in developing high-power lasers for subsea fiber links gave them the foundation for development of the ultra-high-power lasers that NVIDIA has turned to for its 200G photonic-enabled switches with co-packaged optics (CPO). This commitment from NVIDIA, announced last quarter, is Lumentum's largest-ever purchase order. This arrangement is just in its early innings.

Lumentum's cloud-facing revenue is inflecting upward and drove Q42025 revenue above even the company's revised guidance. Cloud revenue grew 16% QoQ and 67% YoY. Management cites ""exceptional"" demand from hyperscalers for both their transceiver modules and laser components. Their modules revenue grew 50% QoQ, and management expects their components business to have a breakout year in 2026.

The company has expanded its US manufacturing capacity in order to produce more of its components State-side and meet the heavy demand for its products.

**3. Giga-Chads and Giga-Watts : Distributed AI Factories and ""Scale-Across"" Infrastructure**

That giga-chad Mark Zuckerberg is building giga-Watt datacenters.

NVIDIA is building networking switches with integrated photonics that connect ""AI Factories"" to millions of GPUs across physical sites.

Microsoft is spending $80bn on its regional Azure datacenters.

The massive energy consumption of these networked elements necessitates that they be disaggregated into multiple physical sites, all of which are linked by high-speed optics. NVIDIA terms this the ""scale-across"" network, expanding on their ""scale-up"" and scale-out"" capabilities.

These \~100km links are built today with 400ZR/ZR+ coherent optical technology, which is ramping 30% YoY, while the industry is rapidly transitioning to 800ZR/ZR+ with 1600ZR/ZR+ on the horizon. Coherent optics require the high-power narrow-linewidth lasers that Lumentum specializes in: coherent module and DSP makers like Cisco, Ciena and Marvel are shipping as many of these as they can build. Lumentum signaled strong demand for these lasers in its 3Q24 report.

Lumentum's 100G and 200G EM Lasers are also in high demand. Providers are turning to 100G and increasingly 200G optics to satisfy the demands of their AI workloads in scale-out networks. Lumentum's 200G EM Lasers are on allocation and allow the company to take price as mentioned above.

**4. Co-Packaged Optics : Key Ecosystem Partner in NVIDIA's ""Scale-Out"" Networks**

Electrical interconnects within the datacenter are also being migrated to optical technologies.

Co-packaged optics (CPO) are the long-term answer to meeting AI networks' requirements for low latency, low power, high reliability and high faceplate density. Major switch makers like Broadcom, NVIDIA and Cisco are integrating optics right next to the switch silicon to simplify the connection to the optical fiber and eliminate the cost and power of the DSP that the switch otherwise has to connect to in a traditional external pluggable optical module. NVIDIA demonstrated that their switches with CPO photonics engines consume 67% less power than their pluggable switches.

CPO will eventually cannibalize the intra-DC pluggable module business.

CPO requires high-power lasers to light up the link's optical fiber. Last quarter, Lumentum reported their largest-ever PO, for their high-power lasers for a 200G CPO application. This is almost certainly for NVIDIA's CPO photonic switches. Lumentum appears for now to be the only vendor approved by them for these lasers: ""We believe we have a good competitive moat that will keep us in that position (of being sole-sourced)"".

I expect to hear of follow-on orders for CPO lasers in Lumentum's upcoming quarterly call: The company expects a ""significant revenue ramp in CPO by the second half of calendar 2026.""

Lumentum manufactures these lasers in a US fab, exempting them from any tariffs on this revenue, while also expanding capacity.

So, they are the vendor with the largest capacity to produce these lasers, of which theirs are the industry's best-performing, while being the sole supplier approved for NVIDIA's CPO switches.

A knock on CPO has been the perception of its inferior reliability compared to traditional pluggable modules. Meta dispelled this at the ECOC conference last month, stating, ""While CPO’s value in substantially reducing power over traditional re-timed transceivers has been well established, the integrated nature of CPO and its impact to the reliability, availability, and serviceability at scale has been elusive... Within this initial time period spanning over 15 million device hours, we have observed zero unserviceable failures as well as a 5x improvement in link reliability compared to traditional pluggable optical modules... As we continue to explore innovative solutions offering reliable and power-efficient optical connectivity for the AI networks, these CPO reliability results reinforce its viability to address the future optical I/O challenges of data center network infrastructure.""

CPO has been a technology long on the horizon of the optical networking industry, but its widespread adoption is imminent.

**5. Optical Circuit Switching (OCS) : An New and Expanding Market**

In the face of ballooning power DC and AI factory power consumption, hyperscalers and DC operators are showing renewed and increasing interest in OCS as an alternative, if not replacement, to electrical packet switching. OCS is not new, having had its moment in the sun in 1990s and early 2000s. Google was perhaps the first major DC operator to deploy it at scale in recent years, finding that it improved power by 40%, cost by 30% and uptime by 50x. OCS is particularly suited to AI applications because of its low latency and high reliability.

Last quarter, Lumentum reported the shipment of OCS evaluation units and more recently has announced additional OCS products, likely in response to customer interest. They have two hyperscalers signed onto their OCS platform with a third committed for 2026. Management said last quarter that OCS will bring ""very, very significant revenue in Q1, Q2 and then certainly in the back half of calendar 2026.""

So that's a second significant 2H2026 revenue inflection.

OCS is now a $100MM+ revenue source for the company with margins ""significantly"" above the corporate average and a time frame to significant revenue that is becoming ""sharply clear that it's sooner rather than later.""

**6. Taking Share from Competitor**

Coherent ($COHR) is Lumentum's primary US-based competitor vying to supply the networking industry with optical components (lasers, OCS, transceivers). We noted that Lumentum is sharply growing its cloud and datacom business. This appears to be coming at Coherent's expense, because even in this era of massive spending on network infrastructure and heavy demand for optical gear, they issued weaker-than-expected guidance last quarter. Their datacenter revenue growth continues to slow, to 24% from the prior quarters' 39%, 46% and 58%. Investors punished them severely for this miss, sending the stock down 20%.

Lumentum appears to be taking share: their datacom growth stands at 44% while Coherent's is only 4%. Lumentum as noted is presently the only laser vendor approved by NVIDIA for its CPO switches, while Coherent made no mention of any new POs or wins in the CPO space. Lumentum has the incumbent advantage here.

And in OCS, management states that they have been able ""to capture volume opportunities earlier than competitors.""

**7. Industry Consolidation : Component Makers Get Snapped Up**

The recent history of the optical networking industry shows numerous acquisitions. Barriers to entry have grown as bandwidths increase, dimensions shrink and semiconductor mask costs reach into the tens of millions. Smaller firms that develop key enabling technologies or components have been the ones to be snapped up.

Lumentum CEO Michael Hurlston has been through to this. He led Finisar when it was acquired by II-VI (now Coherent) in 2018.

On the flip side of the ledger, Lumentum acquired Neophotonics in 2021 to capture its expertise in building the narrow-linewidth lasers that have become a lynchpin of the coherent optics segment.

For motivations similar to those expressed in the quotes below, I believe Lumentum is on the short list of photonics suppliers that a larger system integrator, module maker or certain GPU networking giant would seek to acquire.

NVIDIA in particular could acquire Lumentum to secure its supply of lasers for its CPO switches, while also bringing in-house the engineering expertise needed to incorporate optical switching into its back-end AI network installations. Small OCS matrices like the 64x64 product Lumentum just announced would be well-suited to this application.

This of course is more speculative than my arguments of where Lumentum's near-term business is headed. Nonetheless it's a feasible outcome for the company and one I want exposure to.

* Nokia acquires Infinera for $2.3B, Feb. 2025: ""This transaction will significantly improve our scale and profitability in optical networks, and allows us to speed up the pace of innovation to meet the requirements of the AI era.""
* II-VI acquires Coherent for $6.6B, July 2022: ""Coherent is an innovator with a rich portfolio of some of the most advanced technologies in the world, which have been transformative in a broad range of markets.""
* Lumentum acquires Neophotonics for $900M, Nov. 2021: ""With NeoPhotonics, we're making another important investment in better serving our customers and expanding our photonics capabilities at a time when photonics are at the forefront of favorable long-term market trends.""
* Marvel acquires Inphi for $10B, Apr. 2021: ""Inphi’s technologies are at the heart of cloud data center networks and they continue to extend their leadership with innovative new products, including 400G data center interconnect optical modules, which leverage their unique silicon photonics and DSP technologies.""
* Cisco acquires Acacia for $4.5B, July 2019: ""With the explosion of bandwidth in the multi-cloud era, optical interconnect technologies are becoming increasingly strategic. The acquisition of Acacia will allow us to build on the strength of our switching, routing and optical networking portfolio to address our customers' most demanding requirements.""
* Cisco acquires Luxtera for $660M, Feb. 2019: ""Coupled with our silicon and optics innovation, Luxtera will allow our customers to build the biggest, fastest and most efficient networks in the world.""
* II-VI acquires Finisar for $3.2B, Nov. 2018: ""Today our company is taking a giant leap forward in our scale to serve a significantly increasing addressable market.""

**8. Tariffs : Not a Threat**

Tariffs have not materially affected Lumentum's financial performance and management has stated that they do not anticipate them to. But with our mercurial president at the helm, the risk that tariffs will be levied on optics is ever-present.

**9. Short Interest : 15% SI, 5-Day D T C and 120% Institutional Ownership**

While lower than the crazy 100%+ SI values we've aped on here, I consider 15% SI to be substantial, especially for a company in as strong of a position as Lumentum's. The stock has risen 200% over the past six months, during which time SI has hovered between 15% and 18%, implying they're in a neutral-to-losing position. The stock is on at least one broker's hard-to-borrow list. Its 4.7-day D T C and 120% institutional ownership imply a tight float.

If Lumentum publishes a strong earning report on Nov. 4 as I expect they will, one could envision a rush to close these short positions. I have a hard time seeing the bear case here.

**10. Catalysts**

As mentioned, Lumentum reports 2026Q1 results Nov. 4 after market close. I expect a solid earnings beat and positive guidance around additional CPO-related orders, 200G EM L laser volumes and favorable pricing, and inflecting OCS revenue.

Hearing of continuing high infrastructure CapEx from Meta, Microsoft and Amazon when they each report this week should also be viewed as beneficial to the stock.

A rush to cover short positions in response to a beat would provide further upward momentum.

**11. Positions**

I own 2100 shares, worth $440k at today's $191 share price. I opened Nov. 7 230C for leverage to Lumentum's earnings release, and Nov. 21 250C for leverage to NVIDIA's (Nov. 19). I may also buy calls with a further expiration to remain exposed to the longer-term industry migrations detailed here.

308,NVDA,Nokia an easy 10x,"Just saw the bombshell - Nvidia is plunking $1 billion into Nokia for a ~2.9% stake.  ￼

So here’s the tea:
	•	Nokia, once the mobile-phone king, has been pivoting into network infrastructure and data centre switching/optical gear.  ￼
	•	Nvidia doesn’t just want chips in data centres anymore - they want the whole telecom stack. They’ll use Nokia’s hardware/infrastructure + Nokia will run its 5G/6G RAN software on Nvidia’s architecture.  ￼
	•	That means this isn’t just a “nice partnership” it’s a structural shift: hardware + network + AI compute all rolled together.


Why this matters especially for you and me:
	•	Infrastructure plays like this tend to be under-appreciated until boom hits. Telecom-hardware &amp; infrastructure is typically boring tech sector, but when AI/6G (hello edge, IoT, connected everything) starts exploding, these are the foundation.
	•	If Nokia and Nvidia execute, Nokia becomes way more than “the old phone brand” it becomes a key node in the future AI/network stack.
	•	The Asia markets? Oh boy. Given how big wireless/telecom + mobile + internet penetration is over there, and how governments + private sector will scramble to deploy next-gen networks, the upside is massive.


My personal take (biased, yes):
I genuinely feel this is a “100+ stock” in the sense of massive upside. Not exactly meaning it’s trading at $100 today or tomorrow, but meaning the potential is 100× harder than people think in terms of growth opportunities. If Asia flips, if 6G/AI-RAN becomes real faster, I don’t just see modest gains I see leap-frog type moves.



Some risks (because Reddit loves the bits nobody mentions):
	•	Execution risk: Nokia + Nvidia need to pull this off. Integration mess, timing delays, regulation issues could drag.
	•	Big infrastructure cycles are capital intensive and slow; returns might take time.
	•	Valuation mania: If people hype it now, there could be a “let-down” moment if growth doesn’t hit quickly.
	•	Asia/regional risk: Political/regulatory/competition (e.g., Chinese hardware players) could cut into the upside.



Bottom line:
If you’re looking for something beyond the usual “AI software companies,” this infrastructure angle is juicy as hell. The Nvidia-Nokia deal is signalling “hey this next wave is telecom + network + infrastructure + AI at the same time.” And if Asia plays its hand right (which I believe it will) then buckle up.

Would recommend watching this one closely. I’m jumping in (not financial advice though!).",0,31,1761677768.0,2025-10-28T18:56:08+00:00,t3_1oii1un,stocks

309,NVDA,Nvidia takes $1 billion stake in Nokia,"Nokia announced on Tuesday that Nvidia will purchase $1 billion in new Nokia shares, the latest equity stake in a strategic partner for the AI chip giant.

Nokia shares soared 20% higher following the news.

Nokia will issue over 166 million new shares. Nokia said that it would use the proceeds to fund its plans for AI and other general corporate purposes.

The two companies also struck a strategic partnership to work together to develop next-generation 6G cellular technology. Nokia said that it would adapt its 5G and 6G software to run on Nvidia’s chips, and will collaborate on networking technology for AI.

Nokia said Nvidia would consider incorporating its technology into its future AI infrastructure plans.

Nokia, a Finnish company, is best known for its early cell phones, but in recent years, it has primarily been a supplier of 5G cellular equipment to telecom providers.

The announcement comes as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang prepares to address an audience of policymakers and government leaders in Washington DC to keynote the company’s developer conference. Nokia and Nvidia are expected to discuss some of their collaborations and plans at the conference.

Nvidia has taken a number of equity stakes in strategic partners in recent months as the company has found itself at the center of the AI world. In September, it committed a $5 billion investment to one-time rival Intel, and said it would invest $100 billion in OpenAI. It also committed $500 million in self-driving car startup Wayve and a $667 million investment in to U.K. cloud provider Nscale.

50,NVDA,Could GPUS be the next IREN or CIFR?,"We have all seen how CIFR and IREN started taking off earlier this year after pivoting from bitcoin mining into cloud-data-ai.

GPUS is actually doing the same, but its WAYYY cheaper..

Disclaimer: I own both $Iren, $Cifr and $Gpus.


Lets break it down :

Hyperscale Data (ticker: GPUS) has been quietly shifting from its old business model into the AI infrastructure and GPU cloud space, much like what Iris Energy (IREN) did before its stock took off earlier this year.

——

The company recently announced plans to launch an on-demand NVIDIA GPU cloud platform from its Michigan AI campus, expected to go live in the first half of 2026, and they’ve already completed their first NVIDIA GPU cluster installation for a Silicon Valley high-performance computing client. GPUS is essentially pivoting from crypto and data infrastructure into high-performance compute and AI workloads, using NVIDIA’s top-end GPUs like the H100, B200, and B300 — the same chips powering companies like OpenAI and Anthropic. This move mirrors IREN’s strategy almost step for step:

Why this is WONDERFUL:

IREN transformed from a mining company into a $500M+ annual revenue AI-cloud business in under 18 months. 

18 MONTHS?!

GPUS could be setting up for a similar revaluation if they execute well, and with the stock currently trading below $1, the market doesn’t seem to have priced in the pivot yet. 

The company already owns physical infrastructure, power, and land — which gives it a head start over most new entrants — but it’s still in an early stage, with the main risk being execution and funding. 


If they deliver on their 2026 GPU cloud launch and start onboarding enterprise AI clients, GPUS could become one of the next big AI infrastructure turnaround stories — a high-risk, high-upside play for anyone willing to wait. (Not to get in, but to get out.)

This is not financial advice, and i do hold this stock personally.

52,NVDA,Goodyear Tire (GT),"TLDR: That new funny tv show about tires with Shane Gillis came out and also it has been a goodyear. Also they are at 52 week lows and their fair value is consensus of over $12

🛞 Goodyear Tire (GT) DD – A Surprisingly Good Year

Ok, hear me out: Goodyear (GT) is not the sexiest stock in the world. It doesn’t have AI in the name, Elon isn’t tweeting about it, and no one’s buying tires to flex on Instagram. But that’s kind of the point. While everyone’s been distracted by Nvidia melting faces and meme stocks rising from the dead, Goodyear’s quietly had… a good year.

Why GT is Interesting Right Now 1.	Fundamentals are improving – Goodyear’s been cleaning up its balance sheet, selling off non-core businesses, and paying down debt. It’s not debt-free yet, but the trend is heading the right way. Investors love “turnaround” stories. 2.	Stable demand – Cars need tires. Planes need tires. EVs? They chew through tires faster because they’re heavier and accelerate harder. So even if people stop buying new cars, they still have to replace old tires. That gives Goodyear a floor. 3.	Cultural clout boost – That Shane Gillis bit about sketchy tire shops went viral, and it’s funny but also free advertising for the concept of tires. Add in the easy pun (“It’s been a Goodyear”) and suddenly you’ve got a brand people are talking about again. 4.	Valuation – GT trades at a market cap of ~$4B. For context, that’s tiny compared to car companies or even some EV startups that don’t sell anything. If Goodyear keeps tightening operations and cashing in on steady demand, it’s undervalued relative to its role in the economy.

My ANALysis results….

This isn’t a meme YOLO stock. Think of it more like a “boring stock that might quietly double.” Shares under $15 look cheap if management keeps delivering. For degenerates, longer-dated calls could be interesting but this is a long term play, not a lotto ticket.",3,1,1761619590.0,2025-10-28T02:46:30+00:00,t3_1ohycel,SmallStreetBets

288,NVDA,Amkor Surges on Strong Q3 2025 Earnings and U.S. Manufacturing Momentum,"Amkor Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMKR) is a leading U.S. semiconductor packaging and test company headquartered in Arizona. The firm is expanding its advanced packaging capacity on American soil, positioning itself at the center of the nation’s semiconductor reshoring push.

In April 2025, NVIDIA announced it would begin manufacturing AI chips in the U.S., partnering with Amkor for packaging and testing in Arizona. NVIDIA’s new “Blackwell” AI chips mark a key milestone in bringing high-performance chip production back to the U.S.

Amkor’s Q3 2025 earnings beat expectations, with revenue of $1.99 billion and EPS of $0.51, reflecting strong demand from AI and high-performance computing markets. Gross margin rose to 14.3 percent, and cash holdings increased to $2.1 billion after reducing debt by $400 million.

CEO Giel Rutten will retire at the end of 2025 as Amkor boosts capital spending to about $950 million, including construction of its $7 billion advanced packaging campus in Arizona. Guidance for Q4 2025 forecasts revenue between $1.67 and $1.77 billion and EPS of $0.20 to $0.30. Shares rose roughly 3 percent in after-hours trading to around $33.73.

If you check my post history you will see a previously written speculation post on q3 earnings. This post will include a lot of the same information, with some extra. But positions have been rearranged to reflect real earnings date of 11/11 instead of 10/31 like I had originally thought.

Company overview

Nebius Group N.V. (NASDAQ: NBIS) is a European AI-infrastructure company based in Amsterdam with R&amp;D hubs across Europe, Israel, and North America. Originally part of Yandex N.V., Nebius became its own pure-play “neo-cloud” infrastructure firm after spinning off all Russian assets in 2024.

Today, Nebius operates data center infrastructure and provides a full-stack AI cloud platform (“Nebius AI Cloud”) serving startups, research labs, and hyperscalers.

Nebius’s “platform as a service” (PaaS) adds another layer and acts as an alternative to the “infrastructure as a service”(IaaS) models that other Neo clouds use, such as IREN, CRWV, etc

Current CEO Arkady Volozh was co-founder of Yandex. Dig a little deeper into their spin off from Russia and you will understand how talented the Nebius crew is today. They have plenty of experience in large scale cloud and AI systems experience. The only difference now is that they are starting with a clean slate, and access to western markets.

Earnings preview

[Q2 earnings](https://assets.nebius.com/assets/a1ea2731-32b4-4b8d-82b4-0557fddadd1a/Nebius%20-%20Financial%20results%20-%20Q2%202025.pdf?cache-buster=2025-08-26T16:52:29.128Z) was incredibly bullish for nebius, with an 2025 ARR guidance being revised upwards from 750m-1b to 900m-1.1b. Not only that, but they saw a 625% increase in revenue YoY. Q2 earnings were released on August 7, 2025.

As you can see from q2 earnings, they were already poised for explosive growth.

[Then, they went and signed a $17.4billion contract with MSFT](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1513845/000110465925088312/tm2525580d1_6k.htm) on September 8, 1 month after their q2 earnings call.

The important thing to remember about the MSFT deal is that this is not instant revenue for NBIS. NBIS must have activated capacity to service the contract prior to receiving revenue from this.

It is extremely unlikely that Nebius’ $900M–$1.1B ARR guidance (which was already revised up from previous) from Q2 earnings included money from the Microsoft deal. That guidance came out in August, while the contract wasn’t announced until september. Companies generally don’t build unfinished or undisclosed deals into official numbers.

Along with that information, please check their 6k (linked above) - “Gpu services will be deployed in several tranches during 2025 and 2026”, meaning that at least part of the revenue from MSFT contract will be baked into 2025 figures. 

Rumor has it that the MSFT contract encompasses 300mW of activated capacity. Nebius guided for 220mW of build out by EOY’25 and 1GW by EOY ‘26. This again indicates that Nebius is ready to start collecting revenue from said contract this year. 

Given that average ARR over the life of the MSFT contract is a little less than 4b/year, if they even capture 1/4 of that in 2025 they will be effectively doubling their previously projected ARR for ‘25

Side note, a deal of this size with one of the biggest hyperscalers shows confidence in Nebius product and Nebius cloud. More companies will likely follow provided they execute MSFT deal well.

——————————————————————————
Other tech earnings 

MSFT, GOOG, AMZN, META will be reporting earnings this week. I expect a lot of chatter regarding increased AI capex spend as well as increased need for more compute from these companies. This will run Nebius price up until they report earnings.

NVDA GTC partnership speculation.

NVDA has equity stake in Nebius. Nebius will be speaking at GTC, right after an NVDA announcement for a [partnership](https://www.nvidia.com/gtc/dc/session-catalog/?search=DC51273&amp;tab.allsessions=1700692987788001F1cG#/ ) regarding AI agents and full stack software offerings (sound familiar?) the whole Nebius executive team will be there and will be the first ones to speak at 9:40am after this announcement.

Nebius also teasing that they will be announcing something at GTC and to stay tuned.

311,NVDA,Qualcomm announces AI chips to compete with AMD and Nvidia,"Qualcomm announced Monday that it will release new artificial intelligence accelerator chips, marking new competition for Nvidia, which has so far dominated the market for AI semiconductors.

The AI chips are a shift from Qualcomm, which has thus far focused on semiconductors for wireless connectivity and mobile devices, not massive data centers.

Qualcomm said that both the AI200, which will go on sale in 2026, and the AI250, planned for 2027, can come in a system that fills up a full, liquid-cooled server rack.

Qualcomm is matching Nvidia and AMD, which offer their graphics processing units, or GPUs, in full-rack systems that allow as many as 72 chips to act as one computer. AI labs need that computing power to run the most advanced models.

Qualcomm’s data center chips are based on the AI parts in Qualcomm’s smartphone chips called Hexagon neural processing units, or NPUs.

“We first wanted to prove ourselves in other domains, and once we built our strength over there, it was pretty easy for us to go up a notch into the data center level,” Durga Malladi, Qualcomm’s general manager for data center and edge, said on a call with reporters last week.

The entry of Qualcomm into the data center world marks new competition in the fastest-growing market in technology: equipment for new AI-focused server farms.

Nearly $6.7 trillion in capital expenditures will be spent on data centers through 2030, with the majority going to systems based around AI chips, according to a McKinsey estimate.

The industry has been dominated by Nvidia, whose GPUs have over 90% of the market so far and sales of which have driven the company to a market cap of over $4.5 trillion. Nvidia’s chips were used to train OpenAI’s GPTs, the large language models used in ChatGPT.

But companies such as OpenAI have been looking for alternatives, and earlier this month the startup announced plans to buy chips from the second-place GPU maker, AMD, and potentially take a stake in the company. Other companies, such as Google, Amazon and Microsoft, are also developing their own AI accelerators for their cloud services.

Qualcomm said its chips are focusing on inference, or running AI models, instead of training, which is how labs such as OpenAI create new AI capabilities by processing terabytes of data.

The chipmaker said that its rack-scale systems would ultimately cost less to operate for customers such as cloud service providers, and that a rack uses 160 kilowatts, which is comparable to the high power draw from some Nvidia GPU racks.

Malladi said Qualcomm would also sell its AI chips and other parts separately, especially for clients such as hyperscalers that prefer to design their own racks. He said other AI chip companies, such as Nvidia or AMD, could even become clients for some of Qualcomm’s data center parts, such as its central processing unit, or CPU.

“What we have tried to do is make sure that our customers are in a position to either take all of it or say, ‘I’m going to mix and match,’” Malladi said.

The company declined to comment, the price of the chips, cards or rack, and how many NPUs could be installed in a single rack. In May, Qualcomm announced a partnership with Saudi Arabia’s Humain to supply data centers in the region with AI inferencing chips, and it will be Qualcomm’s customer, committing to deploy up to as many systems as can use 200 megawatts of power.

Qualcomm said its AI chips have advantages over other accelerators in terms of power consumption, cost of ownership, and a new approach to the way memory is handled. It said its AI cards support 768 gigabytes of memory, which is higher than offerings from Nvidia and AMD.

Here’s one of those: **GPUS (Hyperscale Data Inc)** \- a former miner that’s just completed its **AI pivot** and is building actual infrastructure for AI/HPC hosting. Remember where you heard it first.

GPUS comes from the mining world, which already has exactly what AI customers are fighting over: **cheap power, cooling, and big data halls**. Instead of mining, they’re now using the same infrastructure to **host GPU servers for AI workloads**. This is not “AI on a PowerPoint” - they’ve **already installed NVIDIA GPUs** and built a base for **commercial AI hosting**. And while peers have been **re-rated** on news and contracts, GPUS is still largely overlooked - with the same setup, the same tailwind, and a far smaller valuation.

# Background

The AI market is exploding, and demand for GPU capacity is massive. But the hyperscalers (Google, Amazon, Microsoft) are still **quarters away** from turning on their next waves of campuses. Meanwhile, AI companies need **power, cooling, and ready-made space right now**. That opens a unique window for operators who already have the infrastructure in place.

GPUS originated in mining but has clearly pivoted to **AI/HPC infrastructure**. The company owns a **57,000 m² data center campus in Michigan** (hyperscale-size). They currently run \~**30 MW**, with plans to scale to **340 MW** via the local grid and gas backup. In **March**, GPUS installed its first **NVIDIA GPUs** for a Silicon Valley–based cloud customer; the rollout went well and the engagement **expanded in September**. Bottom line: they can deliver AI hosting **today**, not “in three years when the hyperscalers finish their new builds.”

The entire sector is shifting: **miners are converting into AI infrastructure** because **GPU hosting yields far better margins** than mining. This is not a blip - it’s the start of a multi-year transition where operators sign **5–10 year AI contracts** and become the backbone of the new compute economy.

Next up, GPUS’s subsidiary **Alliance Cloud Services** plans to launch its own **GPU cloud (H100/B200/B300)** in **H1 2026**, unlocking recurring revenue via hourly billing - think a “mini-CoreWeave,” but at a **microcap** valuation.

# Financial position &amp; cash

They’re also building a **digital asset treasury** of roughly **$60M** (held + committed purchases). For a microcap that’s meaningful - giving them **capex flexibility** and financing muscle without immediate dilution. In **October**, GPUS also **regained NYSE American compliance**, meaning the “.BC” flag is removed - important for screens and institutions. This is often where sentiment begins to turn and likely why they’ve been “under the radar” recently.

# Why it’s undervalued

The market is pricing GPUS as if the business barely exists, despite the company:

* Having a **paying customer** and growing capacity
* Owning a **ready campus** with **power + cooling**
* Planning a **commercial GPU cloud**
* **Regaining listing compliance**
* Operating in a **structurally growing AI/HPC market**

In microcaps, it often takes just **one additional customer** to move the needle: **utilization → revenue → multiple** can shift quickly.

# Peers

GPUS is effectively the **same type of story** as **CIFR, WULF, HUT8, IREN, APLD, BTDR** \- former miners rotating into **AI infrastructure**. That’s exactly the pivot the market has already started to **reward aggressively**. Over the past months, these names have **re-rated** as they moved from mining operations to **building and leasing AI data halls**:

* **CIFR \~+600%** (last six months)
* **APLD \~+600%** (same period)
* **HUT8 \~+270%** (same period)
* **WULF \~+350%** (same period), including **+43% in a single day** on a Google-backed AI deal (\~$3.7B over 10 years)
* **IREN \~+900%** (same period)
* **BTDR** got target hikes after its AI pivot and is up **\~130% in six months**

Same pattern every time: **contracts → utilization → multiple expansion**. GPUS hasn’t been re-rated yet - but it’s building into **the same demand**.

Also compare with **Equinix (EQIX)** / **Digital Realty (DLR)** at **$60–80B** market caps - stable giants with low multiple torque. GPUS is a baby in the same ecosystem - **same tailwinds,** far higher upside **per MW/customer.**

# Short-squeeze potential

Estimated **short interest \~24% of float** and rising month-over-month. **Borrow fees** are elevated. If sentiment turns and volume fades, **days-to-cover** can spike. In other words, there’s fuel for a technical squeeze **if** positive news hits (customer, MWs, cloud launch milestones).

# Catalysts

* Public launch of the **GPU cloud (H1 ’26)** with hourly pricing + first named customers
* **Michigan power build-out** (LOAs, timeline, gas track)
* Ongoing guidance consistent with spring signals (**$25M Q1 revenue; $115–125M full-year guidance**)
* Updates on the **DAT treasury** \- financing flexibility into expansion

# Cleanup &amp; compliance

* **Leadership**: CEO is **William B. Horne**. Founder/executive chairman **Milton “Todd” Ault III** has a **history including a 2016–2021 SEC matter**. In **2025**, the company said **Ault intends to step down from officer roles** after a planned divestiture; **Horne remains CEO and becomes Chairman**, with Ault **staying on the board**. Net-net: governance optics **improving**, operational control increasingly consolidated under Horne.
* **Listing**: The company previously fell out of **NYSE American compliance** (e.g., equity thresholds), but as of **October 2025** it **regained full compliance** and the “.BC” tag is being **removed**. That’s exactly the kind of cleanup institutions like to see - it widens the potential buyer base and removes a headline overhang.
* **Preferred shares (D/E)**: Yes, there are **Series D/E preferreds** with **fixed coupons** (senior to common). That’s **normal** in power/datacenter/infra builds. These instruments often help scale **without** hammering common with constant secondaries.

(If anything, the combo of operational progress + compliance regained + rational financing tools is exactly how microcaps graduate into **credible re-rates**.)

# TL;DR

1. Peers (CIFR, WULF, HUT8, IREN, APLD, BTDR) have already re-rated hard on AI contracts - several up triple digits. **GPUS hasn’t re-rated yet.**
2. In a microcap, **one new customer** can move revenue materially - and the multiple even more.
3. The **short setup** means any good news can be **amplified**.

The market is currently pricing in “nothing happens.” But **if** GPUS takes *one more step* \- a new customer, new MWs, or the GPU cloud going live - the **re-pricing writes itself**. If you want to **front-run the microcap AI re-rating**, GPUS is a classic **asymmetric bet**: limited downside, outsized upside.

Currently holding **30,000 shares**, planning to add more.",10,7,1761561942.0,2025-10-27T10:45:42+00:00,t3_1ohb3ov,SmallStreetBets
54,NVDA,My POET gains so far,"POET Technologies builds chips that use light instead of electricity to move data. Their optical chips replace copper wires in AI data centers with tiny laser pathways that carry data almost instantly and stay cool.

Most companies build optical chips piece by piece. POET invented a “photonic interposer”. Think of it like a Lego baseplate for light. It lets lasers, sensors, and electronics snap together easily on one small chip. Cheaper to make, faster to build, and easier to scale for huge AI data centers.

NVIDIA, AMD, and META need faster, lower-latency connections to keep GPUs talking during AI training. POET’s tech can plug into the next generation of optical interconnects that feed those GPUs. Every data center that wants to grow AI capability needs what POET enables: faster, cooler, cheaper light connections.

POET turns data into light and light into profit. It’s the missing piece that helps AI data centers talk faster, run cooler, and grow smarter.

Also POET is paying my gifts for Christmas.",9,0,1761534772.0,2025-10-27T03:12:52+00:00,t3_1oh3wzx,SmallStreetBets

291,NVDA,$PATH is about to rip 20%,"**$PATH** has given a 20% pullback since Trump Tweet on Oct 10th, but has sharply bounced of $15 and has now confirmed a bullish reversal signal with next price target of $20. RSI successfully holding above 50, with mega-cap AI earnings this week, $PATH is about to rip 20%, all in $20c.

This is where $PATH gets sexy.

* **Partnerships Galore**: Fresh ties with NVIDIA (for GPU-accelerated agents), OpenAI (LLM integration), Google Gemini (voice workflows), and Snowflake Cortex (data orchestration). This week alone, they announced deeper AI alliances that could juice enterprise adoption. Imagine: UiPath bots pulling real-time data from Snowflake, reasoning with OpenAI, and deploying on NVIDIA hardware. That's not incremental; that's a moat.
* **Product Momentum**: Agentic platform's getting rave reviews—enterprises are piloting it for complex shit like supply chain orchestration. Motley Fool just dropped ""4 Major Trends Powering UiPath's Next Growth Phase,"" citing AI adoption, vertical expansions (healthcare, finance), and global push.
* **Market Tailwinds**: RPA market's $25B today, projected $65B by 2030 (CAGR 20%+). But agentic AI? That's the $100B+ unlock. UiPath's positioned as the ""Salesforce of automation."" Next earnings in December could be the spark—expect AI pipeline updates to light Twitter on fire.

Sentiment's flipping too. X chatter's buzzing with ""generational run"" calls and $20C options flow. One trader's eyeing the 200-week MA break for ""multiples."" Even with some promo noise, the vibe's bullish.

**Valuation: Undervalued AF Compared to AI Peers**

Analysts are sleeping—consensus PT's a meh $13.71 (Hold rating), high of $17. WTF? Morningstar bumped fair value to $13.71 recently, but that's pre-partnership news. At $8.8B market cap (post-rally), they're trading at 5.8x FY26 sales est. $1.42B. Peers? $SNOW at 12x, $DDOG at 15x, $PLTR at 25x (with less profitability).

My quick DCF (assuming 15% rev CAGR to $3B by 2030, 25% margins, 10% discount): $25+ PT. But conservatively, if ARR hits $2.5B by FY28 (20% CAGR, doable with AI), that's $20 easy on 8x sales. Upside from here? 21% to $20. If catalysts hit, 50%+ to $25.

**Quick Company Primer: RPA's OG Going Full AI Beast Mode**

UiPath ain't new to this—they're *new* to being this jacked. Founded in Romania in 2005, they basically invented robotic process automation (RPA). Think software bots that handle the soul-crushing shit like data entry, invoice processing, or compliance checks so humans don't have to. Went public in '21 at a frothy $56, peaked at $80, then cratered to $10 amid macro BS and AI FOMO.

But here's the glow-up: They're not just bots anymore. UiPath's pivoting hard into ""agentic AI""—smart agents that don't just automate tasks, they *orchestrate* entire workflows with reasoning, voice integration, and self-healing. Their Platform for Agentic Automation just got named one of TIME's Best Inventions of 2025. And at FUSION 2025 (their big conf in September), they dropped bombs like ScreenPlay (no-code AI scripting) and UiPath Labs for enterprise-scale agent building. This isn't hype; it's sticky enterprise software with 1,400+ customers (Fortune 500 heavyweights like NASA, Uber, Verizon) and a net retention rate north of 110%. In a world where AI's eating jobs, UiPath's the shovel seller—helping corps deploy it without the chaos.",391,236,1761503587.0,2025-10-26T18:33:07+00:00,t3_1ogs58b,wallstreetbets

293,NVDA,Quantum Computing Inc $QUBT fraud,"**Reposted with positions. Mods removed it because it had no positions (I replied with my positions to a comment asking for them).**

My background: I'm a graduate student and researcher in quantum complexity theory. I'm not a hardware engineer, but I do follow developments in quantum hardware closely. Based on my analysis, I have serious concerns that QUBT’s claims may amount to fraud.

[Positions](https://i.imgur.com/cxvZaJa.jpeg). I fully believe that the stock of this [beverage-company-turned-quantum-computing](https://i.imgur.com/Ndz0r8p.png) should go to $0 (or close to it) and it is only a matter of time before it does.

I will split this post into a few parts. First, we will review their fundamentals. Then, we will look into their future claims. Finally, we will review any contracts and future prospects.

**1)** **Fundamentals.** The market cap of QUBT is $3.73 billion and for the three-month period ending June 30, 2025, QUBT reported revenues of $61,000 (yes, you read that right), a decrease from the $183,000 generated in the same quarter of the previous year. They do not have a P/E ratio, as they are unprofitable (you could think that their P/E ratio is high and negative). This means that they have an enterprise value of roughly $3.38 billion which comes almost entirely from their market cap and with a revenue of $263k, their EV/revenue ratio is 12.870. To put it into perspective how extreme that is: 


Company | Enterprise Value/Revenue
-------|------------------------
QUBT | 12870
IONQ | 419
GOOGL | 8
RDDT | 20

If you think RDDT is inflated, then QUBT is roughly 643 more inflated.
Equivalently, RDDT's price would be $137,602 with QUBT's ratio.
This isn't just a premium or hopeium, this is complete detachment from any financial logic or reality.

The company's operational model is a financial black hole. While generating almost no income, its operating expenses nearly doubled year-over-year to $10.2 million for the quarter, resulting in a $10.2 million operating loss. That means the company spent over $167 for every single dollar it made in revenue. The bottom line was a net loss of $36.5 million for the quarter.

QUBT's narrative is that it's a pioneer in one of the most capital-intensive R&amp;D races in human history. Yet, its R&amp;D investment totaled $6.0 million. To compare, [Google and IBM are forming partnerships to pour $150 million into university research alone](https://thequantuminsider.com/2023/05/19/ibm-and-google-join-forces-invest-150-million-in-quantum-computing-research-at-us-and-japanese-universities/), with their internal budgets estimated to be in the billions. How can QUBT possibly compete, let alone innovate, when its R&amp;D budget is a rounding error for its serious competitors?

**2)** **Their future plan.** [This is straight from their presentation.](https://i.imgur.com/p0L9RhX.png) For 2025, they claim ""Early revenues primarily from early adopters."" This is their present reality: microscopic revenues. For 2026-2027, they project ""High-margin revenue from first mover advantage"" and ""Strong pipeline conversion."" These are classic, undefined marketing terms. What constitutes ""high-margin""? 20%? 80%? How much revenue? A million dollars? A hundred million? The lack of any figures makes these claims meaningless. There is no way to measure their performance or hold them accountable. They have no viable plan to get an advantage.
In 2028, the goal is ""Sales Growth =&gt; Market Growth."" This is a generic corporate objective, not a financial forecast. It's a promise to perform well in an undefined future market.

They sell something they call the DIRAC-3, which is an analog quantum annealer. It is not a universal quantum computer capable of running a wide range of algorithms. Its sole function is to find approximate solutions in a a narrow category of optimization problems. In practice, its actual use is almost certainly confined to experimental and research settings. The buyers are not businesses looking to solve their core operational issues, but rather academic institutions or corporate R&amp;D labs that are exploring novel computing architectures. For these niche customers, the DIRAC-3 serves as a piece of laboratory equipment to test theories, publish papers, and perhaps make small claims in quantum-adjacent research. The almost non-existent revenue confirms that it is not being deployed for any meaningful commercial or production-level task.

The primary reason a research group might acquire a DIRAC-3 has little to do with solving a pressing business problem better than a classical computer. Its appeal lies in its novelty and convenience. The machine's use of ""qudits"" and its analog architecture makes it a fun object of academic study at the very best. In essence, someone would want the DIRAC-3 not because it provides a superior solution, but because it is a comparatively cheap tool for exploration and playing around, not a tool for production.

The future prospects for the DIRAC-3 appear exceptionally bleak. It is trapped in a brutally competitive field and it has failed to demonstrate a decisive advantage. To be commercially viable, it must solve a specific, high-value optimization problem significantly faster or cheaper than the highly-refined classical software that has been developed over decades. There is zero evidence that it can do this, and it will never be able to do so. Its potential market is being squeezed from both sides: classical optimization algorithms continue to improve, while the slow but steady progress of true universal quantum computers (i.e. by Google and IBM) threaten to make such intermediate devices obsolete. The DIRAC-3's most probable fate is to become a technological footnote. It is an interesting but ultimately unsuccessful architectural experiment that never found a problem it could solve well enough to justify its own existence in the commercial world.

They make some claims of what they ""will develop"":

First is the Photonic Intelligent Unit (PIU), or ""Reservoir Computer,"" which is being marketed as a revolutionary device for ""compute at the edge"" and Artificial Intelligence. This is straight up misleading and the reality is that reservoir computing is a highly obscure, academic niche even amongst researchers. It has zero commercial adoption. The AI market is not asking for this and it never will, not even in 20 years. AI is built around GPUs and specialized AI chips from NVIDIA, Google, and Apple. The notion that QUBT's niche device, based on a fringe computing model, could make even the smallest dent in this market is laughable. It is a solution in search of a problem, a research gadget being passed off as a commercial AI accelerator. Its only potential customers are a handful of academics, not the enterprises driving the AI revolution. I fully believe they only included the word ""AI"" as a buzzword to attract and scam more investors into their sham of a company.

Next is the Quantum Cyber Module (QCM), which promises ""unconditional security at chip scale"" and is supposedly destined for ""cell phones."" This is pure fantasy. At its core, this device is likely just a Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG), a piece of hardware that has been around for years. While useful for specific cryptographic applications, the market is small, and established competitors like ID Quantique have dominated it for over a decade. The claim of putting this technology into a cell phone is absurd. The cost, size, and marginal benefit over existing cryptographic algorithms make it a non-starter for any mass-market device. It is a commodity component being dressed up in a superhero costume of ""unconditional security"" to attract investors who are fearful of cyber threats but ignorant of the actual technology.

Finally, the company claims to have a ""Quantum Intelligent Sensing Module"" (QISM) focused on LiDAR applications, boasting ""unparalleled detection accuracy."" This is, perhaps, the most ridiculous claim of all (and they have made a lot of crazy claims!). Consider heavily-funded companies like Luminar and Velodyne fighting for razor-thin margins and massive automotive and defense contracts. These companies have invested billions in manufacturing scale, supply chains, and industry partnerships. QUBT has none of this. Their supposed technological edge (single-photon detection) is a known technique with its own significant drawbacks, not a magic bullet. They are entering a market with a lab prototype and a marketing slogan. Their sensing platform has no viable path to commercialization and stands zero chance against the alternatives.

In conclusion, these other ""gadgets"" are not serious products. Each one is a lab-level prototype, carefully branded with the buzzwords of a hot industry (AI, cybersecurity, autonomous vehicles) to create the illusion of a diversified, high-tech portfolio. In reality, none of these products have a credible path to generating meaningful revenue or competing in their respective markets.

**3) Lawsuits and future contracts.** QUBT is now facing multiple securities class-action lawsuits that accuse the company and its leadership of securities fraud. The allegation is that QUBT deliberately misled investors through a series of false statements and material omissions designed to artificially inflate its stock price.

A central point in the lawsuits is the systematic misrepresentation of its relationship with NASA. The company presented itself as a key strategic partner, implying its technology was integral to the space agency's operations. The lawsuits allege this was a calculated falsehood. In reality, the company had only received a few minor Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grants. These are common, low-value awards and do not represent a major strategic partnership. The plaintiffs argue that QCi improperly used the NASA brand to create a false impression of credibility and technological validation. In fact, you would be surprised how easy a company can get one of these contracts. The NASA Phase I grants QCi received were for approximately $125,000 to $150,000 each. It's the financial equivalent of a student receiving a $1,000 university grant to work on a science fair project, and then telling investors they have a major strategic partnership with the university to revolutionize the field.

The legal complaints further allege that the company created a false narrative of commercial readiness. While executives claimed to have market-ready products like the DIRAC-3 and a significant sales pipeline, the company's public financial filings reported negligible revenue. This data is presented as direct evidence that the commercial operations described to investors were a fiction. The lawsuits contend that the company was not a viable business but was merely pretending to be one to support its inflated market valuation.

Finally, the lawsuits claim that QCi made unsupported statements about its technological superiority, including achieving ""quantum advantage,"" without providing the necessary scientific proof. The plaintiffs argue that these were not good-faith claims but were technical jargon used to intentionally mislead investors who could not independently verify their accuracy. These legal actions now pose a direct threat to the company's operational stability, demanding millions in legal fees, consuming management's focus, and causing irreversible damage to its reputation.

**4) My personal note.** The field of quantum computing and its adjacent disciplines is still in its embryonic stage. It is a very active research field with a lot of math to discover, but hardware progress is extremely slow and there are no signs that it will speed up any time soon. 
Any prospect of a profitable, commercial quantum computing business remains decades away. A conservative estimate would place the timeline for consistent profitability at 20 years or more, and even then, it will only be achieved by the organization that makes fundamental breakthroughs in research. That level of discovery will not come from an underfunded startup with a negligible R&amp;D budget; it will almost certainly emerge from major research universities and/or Google and IBM. They possess scientific talent required to solve the hardest problems in science, QUBT does not.

Given this context, the valuations attached to companies like Quantum Computing Inc. are fundamentally absurd. They are not based in any recognizable financial or scientific reality. The claims made by the company's leadership are not merely optimistic; they are so far removed from the current state of the art that no credible expert in the field would support them. This disconnect is so severe that it transcends poor business strategy and enters the realm of potential securities fraud. When a company's public statements and valuation are in such stark opposition to the consensus of the scientific community, it raises serious questions that demand investigation by the appropriate financial authorities to determine if investors were willfully deceived.",732,304,1761402116.0,2025-10-25T14:21:56+00:00,t3_1ofsrr8,wallstreetbets

Lately the stock has been lagging, yet with earnings approaching, it is like one of those arrangements that might turn on a dime in case there are even indications of higher AI demand in guidance. No, not that it is a sure-footed racehorse, but it is more of a feeling that comes to pass when the story has succeeded in following behind.

What struck me was the reaction of the market to such an OpenAI headline some time ago - the majority of traders could not trade it until the market opened. The timing gap is actually brought out by traditional brokers. I have recently been following ORCL on the Onchain dashboard in Bitget as it reflects the price of the stock round the clock, and you can literally watch the sentiment shifts when the market is closed.

313,NVDA,The construction company that has quietly beaten NVIDIA over the last 5 years,"Comfort Systems USA ($FIX) has truly defied all odds. A boring HVAC / mechanical, electrical and plumbing consolidator that has outperformed Nvidia over the last 5 years, showing an outrageous share price appreciation from $55 to $980, delivering nearly a 17x return, all while still not appearing on any mainstream media outlet or gaining significant coverage. You still won’t find this stock on the earnings calendar from EW or rarely any mentions on CNBC. While many say that Nvidia has been the “picks and shovels” of AI, I think in a more literal sense, it has been Comfort Systems USA. $FIX seen tremendous EPS growth, revenue growth and margin expansion on the back of the data center buildout boom to cool these structures and has just delivered another record Q3 beat.

They allocate about 75% of their capital to future acquisitions, 15% to buybacks and 10% for dividends. Growth does not appear to be slowing down in the MEP industry. There has been a significant tailwind in recent years for $FIX and revenue growth has averaged 30%, EPS nearly doubling from 2022-2024, and again from 2024 to 2025, with a ROIC of 40%. $FIX maintains a huge backlog of 9.3B and the CEO Brian Lane says that business is so high that they are being selective in their projects and picking only the best work. Management appears highly competent and Brian is clearly steering the ship the right way. 

Initial annualized EPS expectations for 2025 were around $17-18. After delivering a tremendous Q2 beat, that shot up analysts expectations to $22-$24. Now after another whopping Q3 beat, YTD EPS sits at $19.53, over an entire quarter ahead of expectations for the year from initial early estimates. 

I’m now strongly considering Q4 EPS will land between $9.50-$10.50, which would put YTD EPS of about $30. At the current price of about $980, this would basically be a trailing PE of 32. Based on the 10Q just released, management believes this level of strong business will continue through 2026. Now, if this level of growth were to continue through 2026, the shares are still trading at a significant discount, but expectations of doubling each year quickly has its limits. Continuing to hold this name will be highly dependent on your conviction of the AI infrastructure buildout continuing.

294,NVDA,Daily GOOGLE GOON SQUAD: $GOOGL$ is the true AI king and it’s about to print,"Fellow Regards and Degenerates,

I'm here to tell you that $GOOGL / $GOOG is the most criminally undervalued stock in mega-cap tech because it’s the undisputed leader in the technologies that define the next century. Forget the short-term noise. This is a deep dive into the strategic moat that others can't even dream of crossing.

**1. Future of Tech**

**Waymo**

Google's Waymo is WAY MORE than a competitor. It's the only fully scaled, commercialized Level 4 self-driving service available to the public. It operates 24/7 robotaxi services in multiple major US cities like Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin and testing in other cities

In San Francisco, its massive surge in volume has already resulted in its market share surpassing Lyft's, making it the city's second-most popular ride-hailing service. It’s the result of a decade-plus of calm, deep-pocketed investment, allowing it to log over 100 million fully autonomous miles and complete over 10 million paid trips. 

The sheer mileage, the complexity of the scaled deployments—which have demonstrated an 80% reduction in injury-causing crashes compared to human drivers—and the fact that they are now expanding internationally to places like Tokyo and London is a moat that no other company has even come close to building. The heck, there is no second competition in autonomous self-driving.

  
**Quantum Leap for Humanity**

The recent quantum discovery by Google, featuring its Quantum Echoes algorithm, is a major step toward making quantum computers a practical, powerful tool. This breakthrough, which demonstrated verifiable quantum advantage on the Willow quantum chip, is set to accelerate scientific discovery across key industries.

Specifically, the ability to perform verifiable quantum advantage means we can now trust a quantum computer to reliably solve real-world physics problems that are computationally infeasible for classical machines.

What Quantum Echoes Will Do

This breakthrough directly accelerates the original promise of quantum computing:

* Design Better Drugs and Cures: The Quantum Echoes algorithm ran 13,000 times faster on Willow than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This technique—which is already being used in a quantum-enhanced version of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) to study molecular structure—will dramatically cut the time it takes to discover and develop new, more effective medicines by providing unprecedented insights into how potential drug compounds interact with disease targets.
* Create Advanced New Materials: The algorithm's power to reveal previously undetectable details about atomic interactions will unlock the discovery and design of novel materials. This is vital for creating the next generation of:
   * High-Performance Batteries (for electric vehicles and energy storage).
   * More Efficient Solar Cells.
   * Lighter, Stronger Polymers for manufacturing and aerospace.

In short, Google's Quantum Echoes is an engineering milestone that moves quantum computing from a theoretical concept to a practical, verifiable machine for solving humanity's hardest scientific problems.

Think of it this way - The average age of a few generations from now will be approximately 100 years. This is truly remarkable.

  
**AI: The Medical Revolution**

AI, particularly from Google DeepMind, is already achieving breakthroughs that save time, money, and lives. This is AI's immediate, profitable impact.

* AlphaFold &amp; Isomorphic Labs: AlphaFold, an AI model from DeepMind, solved the 50-year-old problem of protein folding. This monumental achievement earned Google DeepMind's Demis Hassabis and John Jumper a share of the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry (along with David Baker). In simple terms, proteins are the body's tiny machines. Knowing their 3D shape is the blueprint for creating drugs. AlphaFold can find that blueprint in minutes, a process that used to take years. Isomorphic Labs is now using this and other advanced AI to design new small-molecule drugs from scratch at ""digital speed,"" accelerating drug discovery from years to months.
* AI and Quantum Synergy: This is where the magic happens. AI (the brain) helps guide the ultra-powerful quantum computer (the brawn) by identifying which molecules to focus on and then analyzing the quantum simulation results. This hybrid approach makes breakthroughs possible that would be computationally impossible otherwise. Google is the only company with a dominant lead in *both* technologies.

  
**2. AI Supremacy: The Foundational Architect**

The current AI boom exists because of Google, and its competitive position is strong due to decades of strategic investment focused on making powerful technology affordable enough to scale effectively. By now, it is widely known that the foundational technology for modern AI—the Transformer architecture—was created by Google.

* Models: Leading Across the Modalities Google has established market-leading or top-tier models across text, image, and video.
   * Text &amp; Multimodal: The Gemini family of models sets the pace in multimodal reasoning, handling text, code, audio, and video inputs.
   * Image (Nano Banana/Imagen): The technology powering Nano Banana (Gemini 2.5 Flash Image) excels at enterprise-critical tasks like advanced editing that preserves character/product consistency across iterations—a crucial capability for marketing and design.
   * Video (Veo): Google's cutting-edge video generation models, like Veo, are rapidly advancing the state-of-the-art in creating high-quality, long-form video content.
* Infrastructure: The TPU Efficiency Moat Google designs its own custom AI chips, the Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), which are engineered for peak AI efficiency and low-cost operation. They have spent years perfecting this hardware because a tech needs to be affordable for it to scale and work. This commitment to efficiency is so superior that competitors, including major AI labs, must increasingly rely on the latest generations of Google's custom hardware by coming to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to train and run their own cutting-edge models. This external validation proves that Google's approach is about making large-scale AI economically sensible.

The Vertical Advantage:

Google is the only major company that is competing fiercely and winning or coming close to the top in every critical layer of the AI stack:

1. Infrastructure (TPUs): Competing directly with NVIDIA on highly efficient, specialized AI silicon.
2. Foundation Models (Gemini, Imagen, Veo): Competing with OpenAI/Microsoft and Anthropic on core intelligence.
3. Applications (Nano Banana, AI Overviews): Integrating AI features into products that serve billions of users globally.

This end-to-end control, from the silicon chip to the final consumer application, provides a powerful strategic and economic advantage that is unmatched in the industry.

  
**3. The ChatGPT Myth and Search Dominance**

The idea that chatgpt will kill Google Search is a false narrative. Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Reddit all were supposed to reduce google search queries. They have only grown. This new technology has made it much easier to ask any type or questions in any language. We were previously limited to what we would or could google. Now there are no limits. The more we know, the more questions we have and the more we search. Google search will be just fine.

I think ChatGPT will become another app on the phone where users will go to. I envision it as a personal assistant and less of search. But only time will tell.

Google was and will remain the gateway to the internet. The new AI business will be a net positive for Google by creating a new revenue stream through Google Cloud (GCP) and gemini features and subscriptions to its user base.

**4. The Financial Powerhouse and PE Hypothesis**

The fundamentals confirm this giant is firing on all cylinders.

* Net Income King: Alphabet's Trailing Twelve Months net income ending June 30, 2025, was $115.573 Billion, making it one of the most profitable companies in the world. This was more than MSFT $101.832 billion and APPL $99.280 billion
* Accelerating Triple-Threat Growth: All core segments - Google Cloud, Youtube and Google Search  are growing at double-digit rates.

The core reason Google's Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio is generally lower than many other tech companies is its revenue mix being heavily dominated by consumer advertising.

  
Simply put, investors are willing to pay a higher multiple (PE) for the more predictable, higher-margin, and rapidly growing recurring revenue streams typical of enterprise software and cloud platforms.

My hypothesis is with AI increasingly driving revenue through Google Cloud Platform (GCP), the enterprise segment will become a bigger component of Google's business mix, and hence, the company will earn a higher blended Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio. This is because Enterprise and Cloud businesses are valued more highly, providing predictable, high-margin, recurring subscription revenue (SaaS), a financial profile superior to advertising. As this higher-multiple segment captures a greater share of Google's overall profit, the market will be forced to re-rate $GOOGL with a higher blended multiple, making the current valuation—which is depressed by the ad-centric multiple look like a significant undervaluation and a compelling investment opportunity.

  
TLDR : GOOGL is a generational buy. You're buying the best-in-class *present* (Search/Maps/YouTube), the scaled *near-future* (Waymo/GCP), and the *long-term future* (Quantum/AI Core Tech) at a discount.

# INTC IS A SLEEPING DRAGON

**TLDR; No tldr, you have to read it and make an educated decision**

# Intro

I've been researching INTC ever since China started taking more interest in supporting the war in Ukraine. With the orange man talking about how he will not aid NATO in EU it got me thinking. Why would he say that? Could they be gearing up for a multi-front war and wouldn't be able to stretch their forces?

I put on my tin foil hat and started digging in. Taiwan is obviously a very important geopolitical player due to their advanced microchip manufacturing. Recall what chaos happened when COVID struck and TSMC fell behind,.. It took several years to recover. So here I am thinking, who is the only microchip manufacturer that can produce a microchip from nothing.

INTC

# 8-10 Months ago - First play, didn't post DD but regret

Before Trumps election I was looking into their fundamentals and I came to a simple conclusion:

* They were **undervalued at &lt; $20**, because book value was approx. $22.5 at the time

I hesitated but eventually bought in when it went up to $20.12. Buying 800 shares. The idea behind the play was simple, INTC is a critical US asset:

* They are a DoD contractor, all the chips in any weapons, computers, gps ... chances are it's Intel.
* They are the only manufacturer that can produce chips from the ground up
* New CEO with a very good track record of turning around dying companies

**Problems INTC faced:**

* A lot of investments into startups, they tried to be like Microsoft but failed miserably
* Very bad middle management and disproportionately big for the company (I even have some insider info from this)
* Innovation was stalling (well except for a few things)

**Advantages of INTC:**

* Servers are still predominantely INTC, although they were losing ground
* TEE dominance, if you need a trusted execution environment - you will use INTCs SGX (and now they're newer one)
* FHE investments - for those who don't know Fully Homomorphic Encryption is the ""holy grail of encryption"", most of FHE schemes are also QUANTUM resistant

# CEO fixed most problems

CEO started doing all the right plays

* Fired a lot of the middle management and made the company lean
* Sold other investments that they had which was good even if it was a loss to generate money
* Started focusing INTC to be engineer-first again

I expected a $60 PT within 3 years on INTC as a very pessimistic/conservative estimate.

# Trump invests, SoftBank invests, NVIDIA

I expected Trump and I did expect some bank funding, what I didn't expect was NVIDIA but it makes sense.

AMD was gaining ground with their GPUs and although NVDA is much better when it comes to:

* Infra, i.e. networking for HPCs
* Software, i.e. cuda
* Results

NVDA knew that it's just a matter of time when AMD catches ground. So how do you fix this issue? You advance your technology or you make sure that you have preferential treatment at the available foundries.

# The new DD, Mystery client unveiling

I was extremely mad, when on one day I forgot to buy my 1 year leaps for $40 CALLS on INTC, because the next day I see that NVDA invests and suddenly the premiums were 3x. But I still bought, and now I'm buying more. This time I plan on writing my DD to explain why.

I've kept on researching and trying to assess if they will gain more ground. Why would NVDA invest? What technology does INTC have that AMD/TSMC does not?

Well as I've investigated I found several exciting pieces of information:

1. The CEO of INTC has invested and is on the board of a Swiss startup that not so long ago demonstrated a new microchip cooling technology this new micro-fluid cooling technology is supplementary to traditional cooling. And here's the kicker... MSFT has interest in this startup as well [https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/innovation/microfluidics-liquid-cooling-ai-chips/](https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/innovation/microfluidics-liquid-cooling-ai-chips/). So why is this impressive? Well for starters it's 3x more effective than traditional cooling (and that's just the start). A lot of datacenters have to waste money not only to power the GPUs themselves, but to also power the cooling. But it has another kicker and I will get to that in the next chapter as it has even BIGGER implications.
2. INTC has technology that sets it apart from TSMC and gives them a year-two head start. This technology is called ""backside power delivery"". To put it briefly, you power it from the back of the wafer instead of the front, where it needs to go through multiple layers of metal -&gt; each layer adds resistance -&gt; voltage drops, heat goes up -&gt; wasted power, more cooling needed -&gt; more wasted power. So again, less power? Less cooling? Two different technologies?
3. Now there are rumors about a potential big client for new AI datacenters and it's rumored that it's MSFT. Well I'm pretty certain it is MSFT -&gt; see the first point. A big client that will manufacture in INTC foundries will mean the foundry will start printing money. Let me clarify for you, NVDA invested and shared tech, but didn't manufacture YET.
4. Why would NVDA share GPU tech with INTC? Well because they figured out that INTC 18A is happening and it's gonna be a bomb with the lower power input needed. Specifically for laptops. Now you're gonna have laptops with Intel and NVDA cramming up the market. People will develop more (think of it as a vendor-lock) for NVDA (CUDA) and the demand for NVDA datacenters will grow. Because it will grow, and TSMC is already filled to the brim with orders, you need to get manufacturing done somewhere else, so why not with INTC CPUs - The tech was already tested for several years anyway and more importantly. It will create a bigger foothold for NVDA GPU datacenters. Remember you have to wait like a year or two before you get a H100.

This means that the NVDA investment was a long term strategic investment.

# Ok so what's the big deal about cooling - why it's so important?

Well one of the main reasons and I'm gonna keep it short here is that if you want to shrink transistors, you need to be able to cool them. The smaller you go, the more they start failing in high heat and the more you have of them the more it heats up. The road to &lt;2nm tech is through improved cooling especially due to things like quantum tunneling. The moment you go to 1nm quantum tunneling is a thing and transistors start leaking energy because electrons behave like waves -&gt; power loss and heat. With advanced cooling you can overcome this.

Here comes a little bit of quantum hype... Have you heard about the Majorana-1 chip? Yes, developed by microsoft. INTC is more than ever setting itself up to become the main goto manufacturer of quantum microchips.

# Foundries are fully operational

Arizona’s Fab 52 is fully operational and set to reach high-volume production using Intel 18A later this year, strengthening U.S. technology and manufacturing leadership. They are already producing 18A chips that they debuted not so long ago and are already being shipped to clients.

# A hidden shark

There was one big client of INTC that was very unhappy with the fact that the chips were overheating, AAPL. There are rumors they are looking into INTC and see how they perform. Additional rumors indicate that they might test them out with ""less flashy"" orders like apple remotes etc.

# Possible manufacturing bottleneck

There is a possibility that INTC will become the new manufacturing bottleneck - such an event would explode INTC's price up.

# PT

These are my estimates and will cause me to reconsider my long term strategy depending on how it goes:

Overly Optimistic: $80+ within a 1 year  
Optimistic: $100+ within 2-3 years.  
Realistic/Pessimistic: $80 in 2 years.

# So why invest now?

Company is back on track, has secured a lot of funding/investments, has strong govermental support and rising tensions with China play into INTCs cards. The company is completely restructured and set to be innovative, they have a strong base and good book value to be ""start-up like"" but with actual ground to stand on.

# Catalysts and what to look out for

Possibly positive catalysts:

* Earning Calls are expected to be very positive. Might also include the reveal of the client, but doubt it. Depending on what they share the price might skyrocket
* Jan26, we will have news about the Arizona FAB 52 and how well it's performing
* Q4 2025, Q2, Q3 2026 earning calls -&gt; These will have the most impact in the upcoming year with Q4 being the biggest.
* Higher tensions in Russian-Ukranian war. China has funded Russia and in return requested paratrooper training. The longer the RU/UA war goes the higher the chance China will decide to go for Taiwan.
* Autumn / April of each year going onwards. This is the window if I'm not mistaken when there aren't high seas in the taiwan strait, making it possible to perform an amphibious landing.

Negative catalysts:

* Jan26, failing production
* Q2-Q3, failing interest in 18A - undelivered promises, overheats etc.
* TSMC moves advance tech on US soil (unlikely, will incentives US to abandon Taiwan)

# What am I doing?

Increasing my position with leaps **before and after earning calls**. As the current earning calls can have the opposite effect given what's been happening lately.

**DISCLAIMER: This is not financial advice, invest only at your own risk and after doing some additional research into the company.

Well one of the main reasons and I'm gonna keep it short here is that if you want to shrink transistors, you need to be able to cool them. The smaller you go, the more they start failing in high heat and the more you have of them the more it heats up. The road to &lt;2nm tech is through improved cooling especially due to things like quantum tunneling. The moment you go to 1nm quantum tunneling is a thing and transistors start leaking energy because electrons behave like waves -&gt; power loss and heat. With advanced cooling you can overcome this.

Here comes a little bit of quantum hype... Have you heard about the Majorana-1 chip? Yes, developed by microsoft. INTC is more than ever setting itself up to become the main goto manufacturer of quantum microchips.

# Foundries are fully operational

Arizona’s Fab 52 is fully operational and set to reach high-volume production using Intel 18A later this year, strengthening U.S. technology and manufacturing leadership. They are already producing 18A chips that they debuted not so long ago and are already being shipped to clients.

# A hidden shark

There was one big client of INTC that was very unhappy with the fact that the chips were overheating, AAPL. There are rumors they are looking into INTC and see how they perform. Additional rumors indicate that they might test them out with ""less flashy"" orders like apple remotes etc.

# Possible manufacturing bottleneck

There is a possibility that INTC will become the new manufacturing bottleneck - such an event would explode INTC's price up.

# PT

These are my estimates and will cause me to reconsider my long term strategy depending on how it goes:

Overly Optimistic: $80+ within a 1 year  
Optimistic: $100+ within 2-3 years.  
Realistic/Pessimistic: $80 in 2 years.

# So why invest now?

Company is back on track, has secured a lot of funding/investments, has strong govermental support and rising tensions with China play into INTCs cards. The company is completely restructured and set to be innovative, they have a strong base and good book value to be ""start-up like"" but with actual ground to stand on.

# Catalysts and what to look out for

Possibly positive catalysts:

* Earning Calls are expected to be very positive. Might also include the reveal of the client, but doubt it. Depending on what they share the price might skyrocket
* Jan26, we will have news about the Arizona FAB 52 and how well it's performing
* Q4 2025, Q2, Q3 2026 earning calls -&gt; These will have the most impact in the upcoming year with Q4 being the biggest.
* Higher tensions in Russian-Ukranian war. China has funded Russia and in return requested paratrooper training. The longer the RU/UA war goes the higher the chance China will decide to go for Taiwan.
* Autumn / April of each year going onwards. This is the window if I'm not mistaken when there aren't high seas in the taiwan strait, making it possible to perform an amphibious landing.

Negative catalysts:

* Jan26, failing production
* Q2-Q3, failing interest in 18A - undelivered promises, overheats etc.
* TSMC moves advance tech on US soil (unlikely, will incentives US to abandon Taiwan)

# What am I doing?

Increasing my position with leaps **before and after earning calls**. As the current earning calls can have the opposite effect given what's been happening lately.

**EDIT 28.10. pre-market:** I have a reasonable suspicion to believe that AMD might also be the AI client. If that's the case it won't be because of the actual main chip manufacturing but possibly microcontrollers etc.  
I consider this more of a tinfoil conspiracy, given the latest news regarding AMD AI Datacenter, financed by DoE.

65,NVDA,"INTC DEGEN DILIGENCE PT 3 (1/5 PORT, ~60k scalped ALL TIME)","If you look at the space Intel competes in... ok, AMD and Nvidia, Qualcomm etc. These are all American companies that are not state-backed. So it feels unfair that Intel is USG backed... It feels wrong to bet on a stock that so many have been burned on before. 

Just stop. TSMC is state backed. TSMC = Taiwan. And Samsung = Korea, who is also state backed. SMIC = China, who is also state backed... every major Asian foundry is state backed. So it's arguably MORE free market for Intel to be state backed, and REALLY annoying that analysts and retail investors alike cannot wrap their heads around this. 

It would be like running a race but everyone else is cheating, and then when you decide to cheat, everyone complains!

Then by extension, if TSMC is state backed, and Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm etc. rely on TSMC, by extension, the Taiwanese government is backing Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm etc. Since you can't make a chip without a fab, TSMC is the missing half of many of these companies. So overall, the ""free market"" isn't and wasn't ever free once TSMC and Samsung started to dominate. If anything, it is unamerican. 

If you want to be a high end fab and compete in the world stage... you must be state backed. This step has already been completed, and INTC has been moving faster than ever before.

In fact, Intel never had a chance before this administration. 

But now? Saudi investments, NVDA, rumors of more, (potential) OpenAI involvement that they missed out on beforehand, Lip Bu-Tan’s success rate, US Foundry + Taiwanese conflicts, Rare Earth company collaborations, etc etc etc. Also, the USG planning on spending $20T into investments? They are as degen as us and might as well DCA / use their influence to force companies into Intel Foundry use.

Earnings guidance will be good, and the pump will continue till end of year if Trump so pleases. Expect more from Intel for the years to come, as it truly is too big to fail.

296,NVDA,Meta – DD From a Senior Finance Manager,"My favorite earnings play this quarter is one of the bigger companies, Meta (Q3 earnings 10/29/25 after market closes). I strongly believe Meta will beat earnings this upcoming quarter due to the following:

1. EPS Historical trends – Meta has **beat** the last 8 earnings cycles. From a management perspective, compensation is almost always tied to beating earnings and it’s up to senior management to push back on sand bagged forecasts. When a company beats earnings for 8 cycles in a row, it’s likely upper management are not pushing back too hard on goal setting forecasts, which makes it more likely that they will also beat earnings this cycle.

https://preview.redd.it/4carlwaqthwf1.png?width=784&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=610b5c9521adcf4c8d4f8734a61d90336b26023e

2. CapEx Spend – **Meta is planning on increasing capex spend from $39.2b in 2024 to $66b+ in 2025 to targeting $100b in 2026**. In the first half of 2025 alone, capex spend was already $30.7b, largely around investment in AI infrastructure. From a Corporate Finance perspective, there are usually capex reviews on a monthly-quarterly basis. By October 2025, I’d expect the 2026 plan to be completed and possibly the plan up to 2030 to be completed. Capex approval is usually closely related to future revenue. If the team is projecting that revenue will be flat, capex will usually also need to be flat. Given that there is an approval for significant increase in capex spend, revenue projections should be out the roof. Whether or not actual revenue comes in at those projections will be next years problem as the stock bump will come in when they announce the upward revised rev projections.

3. AI Industry Bullish – In the past year, the AI industry has been extremely bullish. Bigger players like Nvidia and AMD have gone up 30 – 90% while smaller players around the AI industry, like quantum computing companies IONQ (46% YTD) and RGTI (132% YTD) or nuclear energy companies like UUUU (270%) and OKLO (648%) have gone up in greater magnitudes. It seems like whenever a big deal gets done involving AI, the company involved sees a big stock bump. Each of these AI companies are up well over 50% since June. Meanwhile, **Meta has been flat since June** and up 20% on the year. This indicates that Meta still has a lot of potential to run up as an AI play.

For those that argue that Meta isn’t an AI play, Meta has just announced in October a $1.5b investment to build AI-focused datacenters in Texas, $14b agreement with AI cloud provider CoreWeave, and financing a $30b datacenter complex in Louisiana. **Given these recent Q3 investments, I believe a large focus of the Q3 earnings to be around how Meta will be a massive AI play (through providing AI-focused datacenters/infrastructure).**

 

**Potential Issues**

With any play, there will be concerns for the play moving in the opposite direction. These are what I see to be the biggest areas of concern for Wallstreet.

1. Large Capex spend – Wallstreet usually doesn’t like significant increases in spending. Note that this is actually also my second point for beating earnings. I believe it’ll be unlikely that Meta simply just says they are doubling capex without any support. In my mind, management will either show significant revenue increases or some other way to justify the increase in capex.

2. Ad Market Concerns – If Meta indicates weak ad demand for the upcoming quarter/year, then that can cause the stock to go down. However, I read recently that AI-powered recommendation models boosted conversions by upwards of 3-5%. Management could definitely use this justification as to why they are supporting AI. Given the magnitude of the capex increase from 2024-2026 though, I just don’t really see them communicating weak ad market demand. It just doesn’t really make sense to communicate a weakening market while simultaneously communicating massive spending increases.

3. User engagement risk – As a social media platform, investors look at Meta’s daily active users as an indication of Meta’s earning potential. Just last month, Zuckerberg announced a record high over 3b daily active users. There has been no real indication that user engagement is at risk.

**The Play**

**My play here is to hold a mix of Meta stocks and call options**. I have calls expiring 10/31 and 11/07 around the current price simply to capture my expected earnings boost, while my shares are there for long-term holding. One note: my personal opinion is that we are in an AI-bubble and at some point the bubble will likely burst. If that happens before Meta earnings comes out, our portfolios are probably already cooked anyways. Below are my positions:

333,NVDA,The Cycle of Market Mania from Euphoria to Collapse,"1. Lifecycle of a Bubble: Financial bubbles typically unfold through four distinct stages — the *Stealth Phase*, *Awareness Phase*, *Mania Phase*, and *Blow-off Phase* — each marked by different investor behaviors and emotional dynamics.
2. Shifting Market Drivers: Early stages are often fueled by “smart money” and institutional investors. As the mania builds, mass participation takes over, driven by media hype and collective greed.
3. Risks and Strategy: Investors should remain cautious during the mania phase, where “new paradigm” narratives and valuations detached from fundamentals dominate. Ultimately, every bubble bursts — markets revert to the mean, and those who stay rational avoid panic selling in the collapse phase.

67,NVDA,Will the next correction will be due to contracting AI spending?,"I'm not talking about AI spending going away, but rather the ability of companies to continue to grow their spending on AI each year. 

If you look at a company like Google, their trailing free cash flow seems strong at 66.7B. but that figure doesn't take into account the money spent on share repurchases, 59.5B, and dividend payments, 9.8B. When you factor these items into FCF it becomes negative. 

I see a lot of analysts talking about free cash flow in the AI age, but they never mention this. They claim that because FcF is so strong these companies will grow spending on AI. But At the end of the day, a company like Google isn't going to cut its dividends or its share repurchases, but I do think they will reduce AI spending growth. I don't mean they will cut AI spending, but rather the rate at which everyone expects them to continue to spend YoY will be lower when they need to choose between spending on AI and buying shares and paying dividends.

I think this could be a really important catalyst that causes people to freak out. Note, I am not saying AI companies are going to zero. I am not saying AI spending will go down. What I am saying is that this AI trade is based largely on an INCREASE of AI spending YoY. If the spending YoY stays the same then we don't get that increase. And if we don't get that increase then the multiples must adjust down. Even companies that are profitable like NVDA and PLTR (I own pltr shares and have for years) run the risk of getting halved. 

And if you think I'm crazy, Berkshire got halved 3 times over the decades and that company is managed by boomers who hate risk. 

Anyway, i would be paying attention to all large company filings from now on to see if their AI spending is meeting projections or tapering. 

Edit:
Someone mentioned BRK not having 50% drops. I remember watching a video where Buffett said BRK was cut in half at least three times, but I can't find the clip. If you look on the chart, BRK had two 50%+ drops. 1998-2000, 51% drop. 2007-2009, 53% drop. And a few other 30%+ drops mixed in. My point is that even the really safe companies can get hammered, so AI stocks (which are being propped up on spending that hasn't happened yet) are particularly at risk.",99,118,1760885209.0,2025-10-19T14:46:49+00:00,t3_1oarh39,wallstreetbets

316,NVDA,Google can build AI infrastructure at 1/3rd the cost of Nvidia. Implications?,"Google is going to build the first AI data center in India, a one gigawatt facility, for $15 billion. There are local partners too. 

Meanwhile the OpenAI-Nvidia deal showed it costs $40 - $50 billion to build the same using Nvidia technology.

Now, looking ahead, say five years, it is impossible for Nvidia to sustain growth if it costs 3X to use the technology. 

What are the implications for Nvidia?

Edit Add - At Gemini Enterprise 2.5 webcast few days ago CEO Sundar Pichai stated that Google's AI infrastructure processes 1.3 quadrillion tokens monthly.

There is no comparable data from OpenAI but has to be a lot less. OpenAI's total processed tokens are just over 1 trillion. So **per month** Google processes 1300 times more than OpenAI **in three years since 2022 end**. That is huge. 

(hopefully I gave all the right facts). 

Obviously Google feels it is by far ahead and thus the flurry of circular deals in rest of the industry.

317,NVDA,Best hedge against the AI bubble,"**Disclaimer**: I apologize in advance for the redundancy of this post. I see threads about the AI bubble in every community related to the stock market and many people seem annoyed by them. I guess it's because they mostly focus on trying to time the crash or even announcing it's happening right as they post, without really exploring what the best hedge against a potential bubble burst might be. 

So today we all know there is an AI bubble: every mainstream media outlet, platform and social network is filled with posts about the circular investment of Open-AI, Oracle and Nvidia as well as the massive capex of every company in the AI sector. I am not saying the bubble *will* burst, maybe one of the companies doing AI research will create an AGI or make a major breakthrough in the coming months or years that could justify the capital invested in them. But what if not, or not quickly enough ?   
  
Like most people who invest on the stock market I own shares of companies with significant exposure to the AI boom. With the current instability in the US economy and politics, gold skyrocketing and the US dollar declining I'm looking for a hedge against a potential crash. I'm considering taking a small long-term put position against a company in the AI sector.   
  
So here's the big question :

69,NVDA,Last Chance NVTS Lottery Tickets,"TLDR: Navitas is a US-based semiconductor company that uses better power conversion than competitors while demand grows. New designs, major contracts, and upcoming earnings make it a great buy right now unless you’re scared of the casino.

The AI bull run is still showing no signs of stopping. Major names like NVDA and ORCL have largely fulfilled their opportunities to moon at this time, leaving smaller, more speculative companies on the betting table. AI has raised several accompanying sectors in its rally, including companies that feed into its need for power, data centers, and semiconductors.

This is where Navitas Semiconductor (NVTS) comes in. Robinhood leads its description as, “engag[ing] in the development of ultra-efficient gallium nitride (GaN) semiconductors.” GaN semiconductors are the technological successor to silicon power conversion which is quickly becoming antiquated among systems that demand cool, compact, power-efficient semiconductors. 

They are not the first to use GaN technology; however, they do produce the only GaN, fully integrated circuits under their trademark GaNFast™ monolithic integrated chips. This differs from competitors (e.g. IFNNY) because NVTS produces a fully GaN product as opposed to GaN components bottlenecked by silicon parts in the final product.

Another pro is that they work directly with companies to integrate themselves into final products as opposed to being limited by distributors or as components. Essentially, their existing partnerships with big names like Lenovo, Dell, and SolarEdge are designed to work around them—a system design that secures a long-term destiny for the company considering no one can switch away from them on a whim as it would mean completely redesigning their products.

Obviously, their most important deal with Nvidia is the recent milestone that may have put them on some of your radars with them commissioned to provide the semiconductors for their new data centers set to be built in late 2026 or early 2027. The first samples are expected to be shipped sometime this quarter.

With semiconductors being used in just about everything technologically relevant nowadays—computers, phones, EVs—it’s not far-fetched to believe they will be securing additional deals from other big names. They have the most power-efficient system available to date at a time whn every major growth sector is looking for power solutions. 

As for other catalysts, earnings are fast approaching (AH, 11/3) when their revenue has trended up each quarter. Growing geopolitical tensions and administration’s desire to limit offshore dependence may see the power shift from dominant foreign entities like TSM to domestic. The climate is poised to return NVTS to their ATH of $20.16 or well past.

In terms of risk, they are still currently unprofitable entailing some dilution risk. Competition among larger names like Infineon and Texas Instruments is still possible, although my thesis regarding the growing reliance on and demand for GaN suggests the odds are on Navitas’ side.

My recommended position: Jan 16 calls ATM. NVTS more than has the potential to exceed ATH before the end of this year.

Account was dormant for years. Come liberation day and that massive drop in April I bet the 800 or so left in my account on LEAPS assuming there’s no way this admin is going to let the market go to shit hyping up the “golden age”, plus devaluation of the dollar forcing money to continually go to equities. I chose GOOGL and NVDA mainly at first, NVDA was way less far out (expiry in July) because the premium was still expensive for my little account, the GOOGL contracts were Jun 2026 expiry. NVDA rebounded pretty quick and I used the proceeds from that to divest into a bunch of other random stuff (see screenshots) that I saw getting hyped in random threads, basically gambling and got lucky it worked out. GOOGL I held for a while but at one point it was such a massive gain that I sold and replaced with a smaller footprint, that is still the largest gain I’ve had to date from any trade ($555 to $4700). Lots of SPY trades for not a lot of gain mostly because I was hedging volatile times along the way with weekly calls/puts (especially over weekends and FOMC meetings where things felt dicey).

I’ve since converted more than half of my portfolio to shares but still have some random LEAPS where I found DD interesting and the risk/reward was appetizing, mainly for LAES as of late.

73,NVDA,AHOY! We set sail on the Digital Ocean - DOCN $20k YOLO,"Ahoy Mateys,

Last week I introduced you guys to the [P A T H](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o18pxg/30k_yolo_on_uipath_the_path_to_generational_wealth/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button), which was up 30% until the Trump Tariff Tape Bomb on Friday. I'm still holding a large January position there (see updates in post). Thesis intact!

But now, it be time to set sail on the DIGITAL OCEAN $DOCN as well!

I noticed a lot of you discussing “FuNdAmEnTaLs” and “PrIcE tO EaRnInGs RaTiOs.” Maybe some of you need to switch over to r/investing or r/dividends. Since when is this place full of a bunch of value investors? Anyways, here’s an AI play with fundamentals so strong that your mom, dad, grandma and grandpa can buy. Maybe they’ll love you if you can make them some money. I present: DOCN. 

Below, check out the chart. Notice anything? Almost the exact same set up as P A T H, which took off explosively last week after breaking mult-year accumulation range. Here we have a smaller market cap, and much lower P/E at 31.

End of September it JUST completed a Golden Cross.

https://preview.redd.it/4spb82g0n9vf1.png?width=1822&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51e8f47a51d85453a5a6da8deed7e2eafc04dd53

Trendline going back to August 2023 indicates a breakout here would be huge, and at a meager market cap of 3.6B, this can easily double from here through the end of the year. Once eyes are on this and it finally gets the attention it deserves, it’s going to absolutely fly in this frothy market that is salivating for any AI play it can sink its teeth into.

Now lets look at fUnDamENtalS

**What the fuck does DOCN do?** Digital Ocean is a cloud computing company that owns and operates the equipment to run data centers globally. That's right, THEY RUN DATA CENTERS. Oh, just the little old things that are required by **every single AI developer and crypto miner** to do… fucking everything. THINK MARK, THINK. 

**They’re selling SHOVELS IN A GOLD RUSH**

Now, as if just being a data center isn’t enough to send a stock flying in this market… \**cough cough\**… APLD, GLXY, CRWV, NBIS, INOD… \**cough cough*\* DOCN has something that few emerging AI/data/cloud companies bring to the table…**EARNINGS. This company actually makes money. They have a 31 p/e and reported an adjusted EPS of $.92 on September 4, 2025.** 

**DOCN IS ALSO A DIRECT VENDOR OF AMD CLOUD COMPUTING GPUS.** 

**The numbers:** Go ahead, take a look. Find me another data/AI company with a $3b market cap boasting numbers like this:

https://preview.redd.it/jlywjt63n9vf1.png?width=898&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bed35a8ce47fd7ee30ddb33f5c79e97f87ed2a45

These guys are printing money for their size. **They BIGLY beat earnings expectations eight times in a row. Last earnings they pumped 30%.** For comparison, APLD has a market cap 3x larger with only \~60m in quarterly revenue. (thats like one third of the quarterly revenue DOCN makes.) Jensen Huangs speech last week emphasized the importance of data centers. And that’s not where the NVDA connection stops…

**New Partnerships:** ever heard of NVDA? Ever heard of AMD? Ever heard of openAI? Well… DOCN has deals with **ALL THREE**. The openAI deal is brand new as of October 2025. AS IF this company isn’t a powerhouse on its own… they stand to be a DIRECT BENEFICIARY to the AMD/openAI deal… You know, the one that caused AMD to pump almost 50% last week???

 Why? I’ll repeat it again you dense motherfucker. **DOCN IS A DIRECT VENDOR FOR AMD GPUS.** **NAMELY, THE MI300X CHIP.** openAI is driving the implementation of AMD’s chips to supplement the heavy chip demand. 

As i was preparing this, an additional AMD deal was announced with Oracle for deployment of 50,000 AMD cloud GPUs… data/cloud/ai is the place to be in this market. 

***Now of course this is WSB and who cares about fundamentals when the market runs on crushing those “not long” and exploiting gamma ramps, and this is where things start to get really spicy…***

**IV / TA** 

Let me be clear. This is a 31x p/e company with excellent cash flow. The thesis of this play is NOT a S I play, but a realization of value… That said, bears have painted themselves into a corner. DOCN went public in 2021 and pumped to an ATH of $133 within months… then, stock suffered a large drawdown in the 2021/2022 bear market but stabilized around 30 to 40, where it’s been sideways for three years despite growing their revenue and EPS. 

Per fintel, the stock has 15.57% S I… That’s not all… check out the insane gamma ramp for the November option expiration. 

https://preview.redd.it/aa979si9n9vf1.png?width=941&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=35413ba0b91d84cc4994fb261e6c85214cef0e75

This can gamma ramp in a hurry with a breakout over $40-45, and IV is still very very low, sitting around 80% across most contracts. 

And because there’s no weekly options, market makers cannot easily hedge upwards momentum, so there’s absolutely nothing to stand in the way of this gamma ramp a month out if things pick up speed. Monthly options carry much greater gamma risk for market makers. You want in on this before it gets stacked with weeklies!

**Analysts upgrades:** turns out, I'm not the only idiot who has found this company… 

* Canaccord raised their price target from 49 to 55 10/10/2025
* UBS raised price target to 40 from 32
* Market Edge rates it as “Long” (their maximum rating)
* LSEG rates this stock as “out-perform” 

**Position:** Currently holding these calls post dating earnings.

40 x Jan '26 $55c

30x December '25 $55c

55x November $50c

TLDR; ***DOCN is*** ***SELLING SHOVELS IN A GOLD RUSH***, they’re a cloud/data center company that makes a lot of fucking money. They have a 30x p/e, a $3.6b market cap, established partnerships with AMD, NVDA, and a brand new October 2025 deal with OPENAI. They also stand to be a direct beneficiary of the AMD/openAI, and AMD/ORCL deal. Other data centers such as APLD, GLXY, CRWV, NBIS, INOD have pumped to the moon, while DOCN has been sleeping despite the fact that it has incredibly strong numbers. The stock is breaking out of a 3 year consolidation. Previous ATH was 133.

320,NVDA,"$SSYS: Certified to Print Drones, Aerospace parts, and Great Returns On Investment","I’m long SSYS as I believe it is a massive sleeper play when it comes to drone/aircraft development and American military industrialization/ expansion.

**Executive Summary:** 

Stratasys ( $SSYS) is a leading additive manufacturing company with a strong installed base and differentiated position in polymer 3D printing for industrial applications. A particularly compelling growth driver for this company lies in its aerospace and defense vertical, where Stratasys is one of the few players with qualified thermoplastics (e.g., ULTEM 9085/1010) and certified processes for flight-ready parts. This position benefits from the aerospace sector’s record backlog and from the defense departments demand for lightweight, durable components in contemporary aircraft and drones where additive manufacturing enables on-demand part replacement, weight reduction, and customization. Military adoption is accelerating due to the need for distributed logistics and digital warehousing, with Stratasys printers already being deployed for tooling, brackets, housings, and spare parts in aging aircraft fleets. Looking ahead, further integration of automation and AI for generative design could transform Stratasys from a hardware vendor into a critical software-enabled platform for mission-critical manufacturing, creating sticky revenue streams and strategic relevance in defense supply chains. 

**Stratasys Strategic Positioning in Aerospace/Defense Supply Chains**

Aerospace and defense primes (Boeing, Lockheed, Northrop, Airbus, etc.) have extremely stringent certification standards for parts. Stratasys’ Fused Deposition Modeling and ULTEM 9085/1010 thermoplastics are among the few already qualified for flight-ready parts. This creates a high barrier to entry for competitors. Once qualified, these parts become part of multi-year aircraft programs, locking Stratasys into recurring revenue streams (THINK -&gt; strong qualification &amp; certification moat for Stratasys).

Furthermore, 3D printing close to the point of need reduces dependence on fragile global supply chains. Stratasys is positioning its printers as tools for distributed manufacturing, especially in forward-deployed military operations (THINK -&gt; DoD &amp; NATO supply chain security).

**Revenue Acceleration Levers**

Defense contractors don’t just buy one 3D printer, they often roll them out across multiple facilities once qualification is achieved. Each printer also locks in recurring high-margin consumables like filaments and resins. Furthermore, Stratasys direct manufacturing could see DoD contracts for on-demand spare part printing, turning the company into a “digital warehouse” for legacy aircraft parts. For example, the Air Force has thousands of aging aircraft (C-130, KC-135, F-16) where traditional parts are obsolete. Additive manufacturing is one of the only viable solutions. (THINK -&gt; Pseudo razor and blades business model when it comes to a 3D printer install base and subsequent high-margin consumables and on-demand part production services).

To further expand on this “digital warehousing” concept… The DoD has an initiative for a military digital thread that focuses on creating a comprehensive, secure, and interconnected system of digital assets and data across the entire lifecycle of a defense system, from conceptualization to sustainment. This includes the idea of storing qualified part files in secure databases with the subsequent goal of manufacturing or printing them on demand at needed locations. The technology/product that Stratasys provides directly aligns with the Pentagon’s logistics resilience goal. And this military digital thread initiative will only further expand as defense budgets increase globally (esp. in NATO, Indo-Pacific and South America) where additive manufacturing helps with distributed logistics.

**Technology Roadmap &amp; Differentiation**

Stratasys is moving into carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastics and high-temp polymers (PEKK, PEI blends) that can replace aluminum in aerospace parts. There are multiple defense applications for this:

* Lightweight ducting, housings, brackets in aircraft.
* Drone structural parts (where low weight and quick customization are critical).
* Tooling &amp; jigs for production lines, an overlooked but large revenue stream.

Furthermore, Stratasys isn’t just about hardware, it’s about locking customers into a digital ecosystem (GrabCAD Print, software certification layers, material traceability). Much like NVIDIA uses its CUDA software stack to create switching costs and capture value well beyond the GPU itself, Stratasys is building a certification and compliance-driven ecosystem that embeds its technology deep into aerospace and defense supply chains, making it difficult and costly for customers to move elsewhere.

Overall, all of this positions Stratasys as not just a printer maker but a platform company in the defense supply chain… recurring SaaS/service revenues layered on hardware + consumables.

**Strategic Positioning in Drones**

Stratasys technology amplifies drone manufacturing/development through rapid prototyping, lightweight, topology-optimized structures, and high-performance polymer materials like carbon fiber and nylon, driving weight reduction critical to drone endurance and performance. Their additive tech enables custom, mission-specific components such as payload mounts, brackets, and battery compartments enabling faster product iterations and on-demand production.

Furthermore, the U.S. Army is leaning hard into 3D printing for drones to cut costs, boost training realism, and reduce reliance on foreign supply chains. Units like the 101st Airborne, Hawaii’s 25th Infantry Division and the Oregon National Guard are already utilizing 3D printing for low-cost UAS at scale.

[Link 3](https://imgur.com/a/veBKaEC) 

As additive manufacturing builds on and moves from prototypes/experiments to repeated utilization and eventually military doctrine, the financial opportunity clearly turns into recurring demand for printers + materials across the defense ecosystem as I have mentioned above, Stratasys' aerospace/drones verticle is set to take off just watch. Stratasys is set up to be a quiet but critical enabler, a drones picks and shovels play that almost no investors have yet to identify... YET.  

**AI in print process optimization**

Traditional 3D printing is trial-and-error intensive. Aerospace/defense requires near-zero defect tolerance. Stratasys incorporates generative AI principles, such as generative design, within its additive manufacturing solutions by collaborating with software partners like Autodesk to create optimized, lightweight parts. This improves yield rates (fewer failed builds), lowers scrap, and makes additive competitive for higher-volume aerospace parts. Stratasys benefits when engineers use AI to create lighter, more complex, organic structures that only additive can manufacture. This increases margin leverage; less waste, higher throughput, accelerates qualification for critical parts and further establishes a moat with their software + hardware.

**TLDR Bulleted summary of most important points:**

* Sticky Vertical - Aerospace/defense is highly regulated, which favors Stratasys once certified.
* Recurring Revenue Growth – Every installed printer drives materials + service revenue, often more valuable than hardware.
* Software complements hardware – Stratasys has a certification and compliance driven ecosystem that makes it difficult and costly for customers to move elsewhere for additive manufacturing (parallels to how NVIDIA utilizes CUDA).
* Macro Tailwinds – Pentagon pushing for resilient supply chains. Increasing defense budgets globally      (esp. in NATO, Indo-Pacific and South America) will likely require additive manufacturing as it support distributed logistics. Commercial aerospace backlogs are at record highs, large aerospace companies will likely need additive manufacturing to scale production.
* Drones - Stratasys technology can greatly amplify drone development and manufacturing
* AI Optimization – Stratasys is poised to benefit from AI more than most other military defense and manufacturing companies based on their unique technology and moat

As you know, the stock market trends heavily based on vibes. Sure, a companies fundies plays a part, but at the end of the day sentiment rules the market. 

In the United States, people are very fearful about AI. The investors, they say that its a [giant circlejerk of tech companies promising themselves different things, a bicycle wheel with $NVDA at the center. ](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5552965-ai-bubble-concerns-grow/) Despite this, AI stocks seem to be doing pretty damn well. 

Recently, Tencent Research Institute surveyed over 3,500 Chinese adults (the vast majority of which held a college degree or higher). Note that only [10% of the Chinese labor force](https://chinai.substack.com/p/chinai-331-chinese-public-perceptions) holds a bachelors, so this is a particularly educated set of individuals. 

To me, the most interesting bullet from the survey results is the following: 

&gt;The public's emotions regarding the role of AI in society are mixed, with both excitement and concern. While half of the public (50.2%) are ""very excited"" about the widespread application of AI, nearly as many respondents (46.3%) express both excitement and concern. A relatively small number (3.5%) only feel concerns.

96% of respondents, who are educated people, fit into the general excited category. There's NO way we're seeing that type of sentiment here in the USA. Here's what [Pew has found in surveys](https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2025/09/17/how-americans-view-ai-and-its-impact-on-people-and-society/): 

* 50% say they’re more concerned than excited about the increased use of AI in daily life, up from 37% in 2021.
* 10% are more excited than concerned.
* 38% say they’re equally excited and concerned.

That's a big difference. 

So what does that have to do with the market.

298,NVDA,"$SSYS: Certified to Print Drones, Aerospace parts, and Tendies","I’m long SSYS as I believe it is a massive sleeper play when it comes to drone/aircraft development and American military industrialization/ expansion.

**Executive Summary:** 

Stratasys ( $SSYS) is a leading additive manufacturing company with a strong installed base and differentiated position in polymer 3D printing for industrial applications. A particularly compelling growth driver for this company lies in its aerospace and defense vertical, where Stratasys is one of the few players with qualified thermoplastics (e.g., ULTEM 9085/1010) and certified processes for flight-ready parts. This position benefits from the aerospace sector’s record backlog and from the defense departments demand for lightweight, durable components in contemporary aircraft and drones where additive manufacturing enables on-demand part replacement, weight reduction, and customization. Military adoption is accelerating due to the need for distributed logistics and digital warehousing, with Stratasys printers already being deployed for tooling, brackets, housings, and spare parts in aging aircraft fleets. Looking ahead, further integration of automation and AI for generative design could transform Stratasys from a hardware vendor into a critical software-enabled platform for mission-critical manufacturing, creating sticky revenue streams and strategic relevance in defense supply chains. 

**Stratasys Strategic Positioning in Aerospace/Defense Supply Chains**

Aerospace and defense primes (Boeing, Lockheed, Northrop, Airbus, etc.) have extremely stringent certification standards for parts. Stratasys’ Fused Deposition Modeling and ULTEM 9085/1010 thermoplastics are among the few already qualified for flight-ready parts. This creates a high barrier to entry for competitors. Once qualified, these parts become part of multi-year aircraft programs, locking Stratasys into recurring revenue streams (THINK -&gt; strong qualification &amp; certification moat for Stratasys).

Furthermore, 3D printing close to the point of need reduces dependence on fragile global supply chains. Stratasys is positioning its printers as tools for distributed manufacturing, especially in forward-deployed military operations (THINK -&gt; DoD &amp; NATO supply chain security).

**Revenue Acceleration Levers**

Defense contractors don’t just buy one 3D printer, they often roll them out across multiple facilities once qualification is achieved. Each printer also locks in recurring high-margin consumables like filaments and resins. Furthermore, Stratasys direct manufacturing could see DoD contracts for on-demand spare part printing, turning the company into a “digital warehouse” for legacy aircraft parts. For example, the Air Force has thousands of aging aircraft (C-130, KC-135, F-16) where traditional parts are obsolete. Additive manufacturing is one of the only viable solutions. (THINK -&gt; Pseudo razor and blades business model when it comes to a 3D printer install base and subsequent high-margin consumables and on-demand part production services).

To further expand on this “digital warehousing” concept… The DoD has an initiative for a military digital thread that focuses on creating a comprehensive, secure, and interconnected system of digital assets and data across the entire lifecycle of a defense system, from conceptualization to sustainment. This includes the idea of storing qualified part files in secure databases with the subsequent goal of manufacturing or printing them on demand at needed locations. The technology/product that Stratasys provides directly aligns with the Pentagon’s logistics resilience goal. And this military digital thread initiative will only further expand as defense budgets increase globally (esp. in NATO, Indo-Pacific and South America) where additive manufacturing helps with distributed logistics.

**Technology Roadmap &amp; Differentiation**

Stratasys is moving into carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastics and high-temp polymers (PEKK, PEI blends) that can replace aluminum in aerospace parts. There are multiple defense applications for this:

* Lightweight ducting, housings, brackets in aircraft.
* Drone/UAV structural parts (where low weight and quick customization are critical).
* Tooling &amp; jigs for production lines, an overlooked but large revenue stream.

Furthermore, Stratasys isn’t just about hardware, it’s about locking customers into a digital ecosystem (GrabCAD Print, software certification layers, material traceability). Much like NVIDIA uses its CUDA software stack to create switching costs and capture value well beyond the GPU itself, Stratasys is building a certification and compliance-driven ecosystem that embeds its technology deep into aerospace and defense supply chains, making it difficult and costly for customers to move elsewhere.

Overall, all of this positions Stratasys as not just a printer maker but a platform company in the defense supply chain… recurring SaaS/service revenues layered on hardware + consumables.

**Strategic Positioning in Drones/UAVs**

Stratasys technology amplifies drone manufacturing/development through rapid prototyping, lightweight, topology-optimized structures, and high-performance polymer materials like carbon fiber and nylon, driving weight reduction critical to UAV endurance and performance. Their additive tech enables custom, mission-specific components such as payload mounts, brackets, and battery compartments enabling faster product iterations and on-demand production.

42,NVDA,Nvidia’s Strength in the AI Market,"Nvidia remains a central player in the AI space, holding strong investor confidence even as talk of an AI bubble continues. The company’s leadership, including CEO Jen Hsun Huang, has recently made insider sales, yet this hasn’t shaken the positive market sentiment. Analysts continue to see Nvidia as a key growth driver in the ongoing AI expansion, backed by its strong fundamentals and global reach.

Revenue growth has begun to normalize after an explosive run, slowing from 86.17% in Q1 FY2026 to 71.55% in Q2. This adjustment reflects a maturing growth phase rather than weakness, as Nvidia consolidates its gains in the high-performance computing and AI sectors. Valuation metrics, however, tell a story of sustained optimism as its P/E ratio climbed to 48.89x in Q2 from 35.28x in Q1, while EV/EBITDA rose to 41.39x, showing that investors remain willing to pay a premium for exposure to Nvidia’s earnings potential. Even the stock futures rush event for traders trading major stocks on bitget for the $300,000 tokenized NVDA shares is adding more liquidity.

Strategically, the company continues to expand its footprint through key partnerships like its collaboration with CoreWeave, strengthening its position in AI cloud computing. Margins remain healthy, with gross margin at 69.85% and operating margin steady at 58.09%, pointing to disciplined cost control. Despite regulatory scrutiny and rising competition, analysts maintain a bullish outlook, believing Nvidia’s technological leadership and strategic execution will sustain its dominance in the evolving AI landscape.",0,5,1760470375.0,2025-10-14T19:32:55+00:00,t3_1o6pa3g,stocks
321,NVDA,Circular Deals Amongst AI Companies Means an Even Bigger Disaster Waiting to Happen,"Putting the unsustainable hype around these companies aside, I feel that how companies like Oracle, OpenAi, NVIDIA, and AMD are operating juices the numbers way beyond what’s really going on in reality. 

NVIDIA as an example says they’ll invest billions of dollars in Open AI. Oracle commits to billions of dollars worth of NVIDIA chips and then you guessed it, OpenAI signs a hundred billion dollar deal with Oracle to store data and so on. Not to mention OpenAI doesn’t even have that type of cash. In reality, most of the money is just being passed around in a circle. It makes your reports look nicer but are you really growing your sales or just juicing each others numbers? 

Unless they’re explicitly saying in an email they’re making these deals to inflate numbers it’s not illegal for them to do this. But as you can see it clouds the reality of what’s really going on and what the demand is for their services.

High PEs and the ridiculous hype aside, I think these types of circular dealings have been less talked about but I think it will add a lot more fuel to what’s shaping up to be an already massive bubble. What are your thoughts?

59,NVDA,"This time, it is really different!","

Congrats to Redditors who have successfully negotiated the latest Tweet-tantrum last Friday and again, over the weekend, and benefited from your courage and nimbleness!

A couple of interesting things stand out over POTUS’s tantrum on Friday and subsequent back-pedaling:

(1) Firstly, notice how quickly POTUS walked back on his hysterics?  Less than 48 hours after throwing a fit, he started spouting lovey-dovey words:  “It will all be fine”

“Don’t worry about China,” Trump said on his social media platform Sunday. He also said that China’s leader, Xi Jinping, “doesn’t want Depression for his country, and neither do I. The U.S.A. wants to help China, not hurt it!!!”

The quick-turnaround is the fastest ever, and it’s *not* a good sign.  Appears the Trump administration just realised they can’t afford to piss China now, and this can’t be good for the US, American corporates and consumers.

(2) The US-China trade war can be (over-simplified and) summarised into two key products:  US chips vs China rare earths.  Now that China has decided they do not want Nvidia’s chips and prefer to develop their own, they have come out guns blazing with their rare earth *export controls*, which are targetted at the US (on surface, the whole world is subject to these RE export controls, but China has absolute discretion, and you can bet they will be flexible with countries which are *friendly* towards China).  

RE is critical for the production of many products: consumer electronics (mobile phones, tablets, laptops, TVs, digital cameras, computer HDD etc), EVs, rechargeable batteries, catalytic converters, defence and aerospace applications (jet engines, missile systems, radars, lasers, optical fibres), various high-tech medical equipment, industrial applications etc.  

Just imagine if Xi decided to play hardball, and ban practically all exports of processed RE materials to US and US corporates?  What’s going to happen?

The US economy is going to freeze if Xi decides to *ban* or even *go-slow* with export of RE materials to the US.

The Trump administration has recently realised they have lost leverage of the trade war to China.  Xi now hold Tronald Dump’s testicles in his hands, and has almost absolute discretion as to what he wants to do. Dump needs to be more humble now, but will he?

Am not predicting the market will collapse almost immediately, since there are still pockets of liquidity to prop up the markets / provide exit liquidity to those who prefer to lighten their positions.  Expect more volatility ahead, instead of markets continually rising in almost a straight line

Don’t want to be the bearer of bad news, but just to make retail investors to be aware: that **this time, it is *really* different.**",216,125,1760449232.0,2025-10-14T13:40:32+00:00,t3_1o6ftci,StockMarket

323,NVDA,$RERE might actually be a better long-term investment than $TSLA… and nobody wants to admit it.,"Yeah, I know. Sacrilege. But hear me out.

Tesla gets worshipped because it sounds like the future robots, AI, Mars, cyberpunk trucks. But when you actually look at the numbers, reality hits different. FSD still isn’t truly autonomous, margins keep shrinking, growth is slowing, and the stock is priced like it’s going to reinvent physics next quarter. It’s become more of a belief system than an investment.

Now look at $RERE. Completely different vibe. No memes. No cult fanbase. No Elon tweets. Just a company quietly executing and making money in a space that almost every tech company needs but nobody talks about: the circular economy.

They’re literally handling trade-ins and recycling for Apple, Huawei, JD, Xiaomi… the entire backend of the device lifecycle. And unlike half the “future tech” companies out there, they’re actually profitable. Revenue up 32% year over year. Operating income flipped from a loss to a solid gain. EPS turned positive. And instead of diluting shareholders, they’re buying back stock. When was the last time Tesla did that?

Here’s the crazy part: Tesla is still promising autonomy. RERE is already using AI (Matrix) to grade and process up to 100k devices a day. Tesla is selling the dream. RERE is shipping results.

But the market doesn’t reward quiet execution. It rewards loud narratives. If RERE were a U.S. company doing this, it would already be a $10B stock. But because it’s Chinese, most investors won’t even open the 10-K.

So the real question is this:
Are people avoiding RERE because the fundamentals are weak?
Or because they’re addicted to hype and can’t see value unless it comes with a flashy story and a billionaire mascot?

To me, this looks like one of those boring compounders that 10x while everyone’s busy arguing about Tesla vs. Nvidia.",0,12,1760414945.0,2025-10-14T04:09:05+00:00,t3_1o65niu,stocks

I truly believed EVs and disruptive tech were the future and instead I watched those positions crash 70–90%. I lost a painful amount of money and still scarred by it.

Now I’m seeing the same type of excitement around AI. Nvidia, Palantir, super high valuations, everyone calling it a “once in a generation opportunity.” But I can’t shake the fear that I’m about to relive the same trauma.

How do you differentiate a true secular shift from a hype cycle that ends with retail bagholders? What red flags should I be looking for this time?

345,NVDA,Reasonable day,"Friday at 10am I had $200.91. Went up to about $1,000 (thanks Trump for the NVDA drop + high VIX for scalping!), bought 662 and 664 calls WAY too early Friday so dropped all the way to just over $300, but diamondhanded them so started today up to around $700-$800, unwound the calls butterflies masterfully in the morning to get to about $1,285 cash, then mistimed a bunch of plays BUT the beauty of not yoloing plays initially is I can basically DCA to make them work more easily.

Despite the crazy gain, just one timing difference on Friday (the calls) and two today (also calls - got in early, then as it started going my way, sold early) would've probably meant being at $10k if I did things similarly otherwise. Hell, the Friday mistiming basically meant I had 6 calls instead of a potential 20 or so I could've had coming into today so that alone would've been huge.",2,0,1760398891.0,2025-10-13T23:41:31+00:00,t3_1o601ez,SmallStreetBets
60,NVDA,'Very troubling': AI's self-investment spree sets off bubble alarms on Wall Street,"The companies at the center of the artificial intelligence boom are investing billions of dollars in each other — and analysts say that the increasing entanglement is adding to risk of an AI bubble.

Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA)) in late September said it would [invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-jumps-on-100-billion-openai-investment-as-huang-touts-biggest-ai-infrastructure-project-in-history-171740509.html) ([OPAI.PVT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/OPAI.PVT)) as part of a partnership for the ChatGPT maker to use Nvidia’s chips to train and run its next generation of models.

This is just one of a flurry of deals among a tight web of Big Tech players that have been made public in the last few months. There's also Nvidia's [$6.3 billion deal with AI data center firm CoreWeave](https://www.reuters.com/business/coreweave-nvidia-sign-63-billion-cloud-computing-capacity-order-2025-09-15/) ([CRWV](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CRWV)), a customer of the chipmaker in which it holds a 7% equity stake. There's [Nvidia's reported $2 billion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-07/musk-s-xai-nears-20-billion-capital-raise-tied-to-nvidia-chips) investment linked to its customer xAI ([XAAI.PVT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/XAAI.PVT)). And then there's OpenAI's own deals with [Oracle](https://www.wsj.com/business/openai-oracle-sign-300-billion-computing-deal-among-biggest-in-history-ff27c8fe?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAi0N-tG2YIkk9TfG4XlqyZMi5QQy4hAXzuYdDYVDhpdx23tAy81vM-Ic-cJizQ%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68e9026a&amp;gaa_sig=3AEj7IfJ4oTZWVP_B6xSI5xye0waShpyKoNR_a3osU_cO8OHb5QbGpwL8XWub6kVfaxJVaMYKJsuEOuvfrx7UQ%3D%3D) ([ORCL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ORCL)), [CoreWeave](https://investors.coreweave.com/news/news-details/2025/CoreWeave-Announces-Agreement-with-OpenAI-to-Deliver-AI-Infrastructure/default.aspx) ([CRWV](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CRWV)), and chipmaker [Advanced Micro Devices](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amd-stock-rockets-higher-on-multibillion-dollar-openai-deal-125503782.html) ([AMD](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMD)).

Wall Street analysts say the agreements highlight a growing trend: AI infrastructure providers, led by Nvidia, are investing in their customers, who then turn around and buy more of the infrastructure providers’ products. In other cases, customers of infrastructure like OpenAI are investing in their suppliers.

Analysts interviewed by Yahoo Finance said there are [two major concerns with the circular dynamic](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/very-troubling-ais-self-investment-spree-sets-off-bubble-alarms-on-wall-street-160524518.html) seen in the recent spree of AI investments. ",520,72,1760390485.0,2025-10-13T21:21:25+00:00,t3_1o5wo4g,StockMarket

75,NVDA,Finally green on a year!,"Been an options degenerate since 2019 thanks to this subreddit. Have blown multiple accounts, even lost  a hard earned 40k in a couple days in 2024, made most of it back, then lost it again on regarded options trading that next week. I had tried switching to shares multiple times the last couple years but as soon as i make a little side play on options that nets me enough to get my confidence back it would snowball into blowing half my account in a day, then hating myself for not having discipline. I started out this year strong holding my ASTS shares but my fear and greed chopped up my account into dust (options again ofc), having to restart from 0 early in the year. I told myself i would buy ABAT (around 10k shares at $1.5) due to it trading for dirt cheap and having some positive news catalysts coming out for their lithium recycling business, combined with a trump administration that would probably prioritize american companies especially rare earths. At many points i would relapse into options, catching myself selling some abat here and there to gamble with a thousand or two, watching my losses pile up again. I even broke the PDT rule on purpose to stop myself from being able to trade, while still holding my then 6350 abat shares. Couple months later and here we are, abat touched 10 dollars today and while i did sell too much at 3,4,5,6 etc, i can't complain about how much i've netted on this stock (about 22k so far). I have diversified much of my abat gains into other hot sectors but i do recognize that this rally will not last forever, and am always willing to take profit and reposition. I still do some option plays on the side but i make it a point to not put on a position that would bother me at all, maybe a couple % of my account max. I still have some ways to go before finally being in the green overall, but for me this milestone is huge and made me realize how quickly capital can build up when you're not actively trying to destroy it.

58,NVDA,🚀 BTQ - The Quantum Cybersecurity Unicorn You May Have Missed 🚀,"**🚀 BTQ – The Quantum Cybersecurity Unicorn You Missed 🚀**

*Reference my last DD on $CCCX – up* *significantly since I dropped that post and still climbing.*

[*https://www.reddit.com/r/smallstreetbets/comments/1o29puf/cccx\_the\_spac\_that\_gets\_you\_nvidias\_quantum/*](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallstreetbets/comments/1o29puf/cccx_the_spac_that_gets_you_nvidias_quantum/)

*Now let’s talk about the next* ***MOONSHOT***: $BTQ.

**Why BTQ and Not the Hype Machines**  
Forget the vaporware “quantum computing” meme stocks with no revenue or roll-up acquisitions they've made to acquire revenue for a premium. BTQ Technologies is already shipping real-world **post-quantum cryptography** solutions to Fortune 500s, governments, and critical infrastructure players.

**1. Already Generating Cash**

* **$12 million**\+ in revenue this year – not just a demo in a lab.
* **Live deployments** with a Tier 1 global bank and two defense agencies.
* **$150 million** pipeline of signed contracts.

**2. Founders Back in the Driver’s Seat**  
Sean Hackett &amp; Zach Belateche - engineers behind Radical Semiconductors, are now *full-time* at BTQ after their last startup sold for $1.2 billion. When founders bet on their own cap table, you know the boardroom is getting real.

**3. Cambridge Partnership = R&amp;D Moat**  
BTQ is underwriting **University of Cambridge** quantum photonics research. That means exclusive IP access and next-gen performance improvements locked in for years.

**4. Government Tailwinds**

* White House PQC mandate rolling out next quarter. Federal agencies must migrate to quantum-safe encryption or face compliance penalties.
* Canadian National Quantum Strategy allocates $500 million over 3 years. BTQ is first in line for Canadian gov’t contracts.

**5. Option Listings Coming**  
New BTQ options go live next week. Volatility for the brave, and a path to leveraged upside without margin calls.

**TL;DR:**

* BTQ = real revenue, real clients, real government mandates
* Founders w/ proven exit track record locked in
* Cambridge research partnership for next-level IP
* PQC executive orders guarantee a massive addressable market
* Options listing uncorks serious leverage

Opportunity exist to enter now before market makers start before institutional FOMO kicks in. This isn’t a pump, it’s a strategy. Don’t be the only regard left watching the rocket take off.

59,NVDA,"ALMU deep dive, deep opportunity- POET comps","ALMU vs POET — Deep Dive: Two Tiny Photonics Stocks with Massive Potential (and Massive Risk)

Both Aeluma (ALMU) and POET Technologies (POET) are micro-cap plays in the photonics/semiconductor space — each developing tech that could power next-gen AI computing, sensors, and communication systems. But their paths, risk levels, and commercialization timelines are very different.

⸻

POET Technologies (POET)
	•	Market Cap: ~$750M
	•	Revenue: ~$0.46M TTM (essentially pre-revenue)
	•	Cash: ~$70–75M (after a $75M private placement in Oct 2025)
	•	Focus: Integrated optical engines for AI data centers and cloud networking.
	•	Tech: Their “Optical Interposer™” combines lasers, modulators, and photonic components on a single chip, replacing the expensive and slow optical assembly process used in today’s transceivers.

Why It Matters:
AI data centers are hitting a wall with copper interconnects. As AI models get bigger, they need exponentially faster and more efficient ways to move data between chips and servers. Optical interconnects solve that — and POET’s solution aims to make them cheaper, smaller, and lower-power than legacy designs.

Commercial Traction:
POET’s not just in the lab anymore. They’ve landed partnerships with Foxconn (FIT), Luxshare, Celestial AI, and Adtran — all of whom are incorporating POET’s optical engines into 800G and 1.6T modules.
	•	Foxconn has already placed orders for production samples and wants to accelerate rollout.
	•	Celestial AI is integrating POET’s “Starlight” engine into its photonic computing chips.
	•	Adtran has launched pluggable modules using POET components.

POET expects meaningful revenue to start ramping in late 2025, as these customer projects move from pilot to production. If that happens, it would be the company’s first real commercial revenue since inception.

TAM (Total Addressable Market):
The 800G–1600G optical transceiver market is expected to grow from ~$2.5B in 2023 to $10B+ by 2029, driven by AI infrastructure. POET’s tech directly targets this segment — every AI data center build-out from Nvidia, Amazon, or Microsoft could be a customer via Foxconn and others.

Upside:
If even one of these partners ramps to production scale, POET could quickly go from &lt;$1M to $50M+ revenue, which would re-rate the stock massively. The company’s tech solves a clear pain point — cost, power, and scale — in a market with exponential demand growth.

Risks:
	•	Execution: POET has to deliver at scale; any manufacturing or yield issue could delay everything.
	•	Competition: Giants like Broadcom, Marvell, and Intel are developing their own silicon photonics.
	•	Valuation: The stock already prices in high expectations — at ~$750M market cap and near-zero revenue, it’s a “priced-for-perfection” story.
	•	Timing: Even a small delay in AI capex cycles could impact demand short term.

⸻

Aeluma Inc (ALMU)
	•	Market Cap: ~$290M
	•	Revenue: ~$4.7M TTM (up &gt;5x YoY)
	•	Cash: ~$39M (after Sept 2025 raise)
	•	Focus: Photodetectors and optoelectronic sensors using compound semiconductors (like InGaAs) grown directly on large silicon wafers.
	•	Tech: Their integration method combines the performance of exotic materials (used in military-grade optics) with the scale and cost advantages of silicon — allowing high-performance, mass-producible sensors.

Why It Matters:
This tech enables shortwave infrared (SWIR) and other advanced sensors used in LiDAR, defense imaging, AR/VR, and quantum photonics. These are areas where existing tech is either too expensive or underperforms — Aeluma’s process could unlock these for larger-scale markets.

Commercial Traction:
Aeluma is further along than most realize.
	•	Secured U.S. Navy and Department of Energy contracts for high-speed photodetectors and SWIR imaging.
	•	Sampling products with a Tier-1 automotive LiDAR supplier, hinting at potential auto-industry adoption.
	•	Partnered with Thorlabs on large-diameter wafer development for quantum and optical systems.
	•	Recently achieved positive EBITDA and record quarterly revenue in FY2025.

They’re still early — no mass-market commercial products yet — but they’re moving from R&amp;D into real-world validation and small-volume production.

TAM:
Aeluma’s opportunity spans multiple markets:
	•	SWIR sensors: projected to hit $4–6B by 2030
	•	Automotive LiDAR: multi-billion-dollar market by late 2020s
	•	Quantum and defense imaging: growing government spending
	•	Optical interconnects (longer term): another multi-billion-dollar angle

Upside:
Aeluma’s strength is diversification. They’re not tied to a single market or customer — revenue is starting to flow from both government and commercial sources. With strong IP, low burn rate, and $39M cash, they have a long runway to scale. If even one vertical (like LiDAR or defense imaging) hits, this could justify much higher valuations.

Risks:
	•	Early-stage commercialization — contracts and prototypes, not yet high-volume orders.
	•	Market timing — LiDAR and AR/VR adoption has been slower than forecasted.
	•	Competition from bigger semiconductor players.
	•	Still a speculative stock despite better fundamentals than POET.",9,1,1760373550.0,2025-10-13T16:39:10+00:00,t3_1o5otnf,SmallStreetBets

44,NVDA,Yahoo Finance says no AI Bubble,"This is from Brian Sozzi, Executive Editor at Yahoo Finance:

Can we stop with all this AI bubble talk, please?

I get it.

Those hunting for a dot-com style stock market explosion want to make names for themselves by predicting a bubble. Who doesn't want the fame and fortune associated with being right in a big way?

Who doesn't want to spend a month reporting on stocks going down 75% because of a freak warning out of Nvidia (NVDA) and OpenAI (OPAI.PVT)?

Entire years could be made for content platforms in a week if the stock market were to get blown up because of a Lehman-like meltdown in tech valuations. If you are over the age of 40, you remember the trading screens during the height of the great financial crisis. Massive declines, a full-on sea of red. Every. Single. Day.

But I'm here to say we have to give these AI bubble predictions a rest. Ditto the predictions that we are in a tech bubble. It's just not what's happening out there yet.

First of all, AI is a real technology being deployed in real ways inside of Corporate America.

Second, this technology is requiring more physical assets in the ground, which are being built to support AI's real-world application. What Zach Dell (son of Michael Dell) is working on at startup Base Power (which just raised $1 billion) impressed me this week. It's addressing a key issue: power availability and costs in part because of rising stress on the grid due to AI development.

Next, the spending on AI infrastructure doesn't strike me as reckless.

I talk to CFOs and they walk me through their thinking, which seems logical. They aren't foaming at the mouth with wild-eyed predictions of grandeur similar to the late '90s.

Plus, the tech giants making the biggest AI investments are fueling their ambitions with cash on hand; not loading up balance sheets with debt. The upstarts in AI are well funded, not being 100% stupid in their organizational build-outs. They're working on tangible technology that has actual orders behind it.

""I would say that's probably thinking too small,"" AMD (AMD) CEO Lisa Su told me about concerns of AI overspending this week. ""You have to really look at what the power of this technology can do for the world.""

AMD is ""investing at the right pace because we want to accelerate ... this is a place where [and] when companies and partners make bold moves, it will be rewarded.""

Who am I to argue with Su, who may go down as one of the best tech CEOs of all time? What she has done at AMD since joining in 2012 is mind-blowing.

Lastly, let's talk about AI worrywarts' warning calls about valuations.

According to new research out of Goldman Sachs this week, the median forward P/E ratio across the ""Magnificent Seven"" is 27 times, or 26 times if excluding Tesla (TSLA), which has a much higher multiple than the other companies. This is roughly half the equivalent valuation of the biggest seven companies in the late 1990s, and the dominant companies in Japan (mostly banks) traded at higher valuations still.

What's more, the current enterprise-to-sales ratios are also much lower than those of the dominant companies in the late 1990s.

""So it is true that valuations are high but, in our view, generally not at levels that are as high as are typically seen at the height of a financial bubble,"" said Goldman Sachs strategist Peter Oppenheimer.

I couldn't agree more, Peter.",181,182,1760288524.0,2025-10-12T17:02:04+00:00,t3_1o4ufmv,stocks

🔸 Friday: Fed Governor Waller sees more rate cuts but central bank needs to be ""cautious about it"". Gold and Silver rebounded after Thursday’s loses. The stock market opened higher. Michigan 1-Year Inflation Expectations preliminary came at 4.6% that slightly lower than last month's 4.7%, but it wasn't the focus for today because Trump warned of new ""massive"" tariffs on China. Oil felt more than 4%. The stock market closed under heavy selling pressure. The S&amp;P 500 felt more than 2.5% and Nasdaq dropped more than 3.5%. 🔴

The stock market continued to rise slowly while the government remaining closed. We did not see any labor market data, so the stock market could not get information from reports. The S&amp;P 500 dropped more than 2.5% in a single day, but volume was only slightly above 20-day moving average. The stock market had made all-time high after another.

61,NVDA,Trump will surrender face to China again ...,"Hi everyone,

  
China got a big monopoly on rare earth, they got 70% of the world reserve, and some exist only in China. Moreover, the piece of the process (refining) is under control of China at 90% of rare metal. Indeed, Western countries decided in 80's to abandon the sector and relocate it to China, because it's expensive and very polluting. So, China decide to develop this activity thank to their advantaged place. Everyone was happy because that was cheap and the western land were not polluted by this activity.

But, now, China is tired to see Western Countries spend some effort to ruin them. Today, they don't want to see US bulding the army with their own REE against them. The fact is US can't say ""we gonna f:ck China"" and ""ok we gonna make a deal"". China wants a real deal, that means the end of tech ban, and the end of offensive policy of US against them. In may/june, Trump was very kind after the deal, ""yes we fight China but friendly"". In the fact, US gov took some decision against Chine, pushing them to ban ree export : Nvidia H20 with killswitch to control their IT infrastructure, tax on chinese ship ... US didn't respect the deal and the process of negociating.

Trump threat with tariff. It's not ""no effect"", but China is a country with a mission. They live to be the first, not to get an iphone and 10000 followers on instagram or of. So they don't care about the rest if that save the interest of the state. Some companies lost millions every months cause of the ban, and CCP doesn't care ... 

Trump knows 100% of tariff on China is : laptop, tv, consummer hight tech with a double price. Are you ready to buy your Hp laptop for 2000 dollars instead 1000 dollars ?

But the big danger is REE. Today, US can't get them. They can but all the money they got to build fab and mines, it's impossible to meet the demand without chinese ree. In 2030, some REE demand will rise up to x6 cause of data center, defense, green energy and EV.

No REE = No data center, no Tesla, No Nvidia, no Apple, No amazon, no Microsoft ... Everything will stop.

327,NVDA,Why SEALSQ might age better than Rigetti,"$LAES → SEALSQ’s multiple sits at the lower fringe of the speculative continuum: anchored in practical domains like quantum security &amp; IoT hardware, rather than floating in the zero-gravity of science-fiction valuation narratives. It’s a speculative play, yes, but one that still remembers to manufacture actual silicone. By contrast, Rigetti’s reported revenue multiples hover between \~1,500× &amp; 1,800× a monument to the market’s enduring absurdity. It’s an irony of market psychology: the company producing semiconductors trades at a fraction of the valuation of one still prototyping superconducting circuits in a lab. That dynamic may invert soon, as capital begins to migrate toward companies offering deployable, quantum-secure technology instead of distant, theoretical compute power &amp; a Wix website. 

SEALSQ exhibits the full suite of credibility: a glossy website, a name calibrated for seriousness &amp; a Swiss headquarters that project discretion, precision, &amp; branding as proof of concept. The company’s narrative leans on the vocabulary of inevitability: “semiconductor” “quantum-resistant,” “trusted,” “sovereign,” &amp; “national security.” SEALSQ reported a 41% YoY revenue increase through Q3 2025 &amp; reaffirmed its full-year revenue forecast, projecting a 59% to 82% increase over 2024. The growth, predictably, came from “strong demand” for its core products &amp; the acquisition of IC’ALPS. The momentum is set to culminate at the Quantum + AI Conference in New York later this month &amp; carry through 2026, sustained by quantum-safe security systems aligned with U.S. government standards &amp; a rotation of partnerships &amp; acquisitions.  
  
When the hype cycle finally fades, SEALSQ’s realism might look less elevated. Rigetti’s website is an aesthetic tragedy that looks as if it were cobbled together on Wix by a particularly optimistic intern unable to achieve basic design coherence. Quantum computing demands a level of obsessive attention to detail: fractions of a Kelvin, picosecond timing, noise isolation at the edge of physics. When the front end looks half-finished, it’s hard not to question whether that discipline extends behind the lab door. Something doesn’t add up. Have you seen SEALSQ’s website? If corporate websites are any proxy for DNA, SEALSQ looks like it’s building things that actually work.   
  
Expect a fresh wave of press releases &amp; conveniently timed analyst upgrades in the near term. The Quantum + AI Conference: alternately marketed as Quantum + AI 2.0 or IQT Quantum + AI, depending on who’s paying for the banner, will occur October 19–21, 2025, in New York City. The agenda promises deep inquiry into the intersection of quantum computing, artificial intelligence, &amp; cryptographic security. Attendees can expect the full liturgy: keynotes, panels, mentoring sessions, &amp; exhibitions. Organized in part by Inside Quantum Technology (IQT), the event serves as yet another congregation of researchers, investors, &amp; professional futurists between funding rounds. $LAES SEALSQ headlines with the highest tier of logo placement. Amazon AWS, Nvidia, IonQ, Rigetti, Salesforce, Amgen, CNN, &amp; Cantor Fitzgerald will also attend. ",0,31,1760166411.0,2025-10-11T07:06:51+00:00,t3_1o3p120,stocks
47,NVDA,NVDA to the moon,"A lot of people have been talking about how NVDA is going to hit a wall and decline with respect to revenue from new installs but I'm here to say why that argument is wrong.

They're saying its like the fiber companies of the dot com era.

But for two reasons it's not. 1. not ""dark fibre"" comparison. The chips are fully utilized. 2. The difference in useful life. A GPU rack is 4-6 years, fibre optic cable is 25-40 years.

This idea started when I was listening to this podcast today [https://open.spotify.com/episode/6hnnZDCH68aR1UpNW5jX1U?si=25be1aa6fa7c4626](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6hnnZDCH68aR1UpNW5jX1U?si=25be1aa6fa7c4626) where at about the 1hr mark they're talking about the CAPEX/OPEX of data centres.

Someone points out and Chamath agrees that the chip failure rate is between 9%-20% in these GPU racks which is insanely high! I also think I remember Dylan Patel saying something similar on a a16z episode.

From those two data points alone [I](https://pocket-quant.com/dashboard?share=0199d1fe-157a-7383-b4bd-45b8fba4e38d) extrapolated that NVDA might be sitting on somewhere between $27B per year and $60B/year in basically recurring revenues from the need to replace failed racks

Once you add in a 4-6 year replacement cadence for the rest of the chips you're looking at anywhere from $90 BILLION to $140 BILLION a year in recurring revenue from scheduled replacements and failures. This is not including future buildout.

  
This isn't just going to act as a floor to their revenues for years if not decades to come. It is their ENTIRE current revenue. They're looking at a massive and durable business just like INTC, hopefully they don't drop the bag like INTC once they're in pole position.

Also according to this deep research report the average chip cycle is 10 years long and we're in year 3ish [https://g.co/gemini/share/436be1c0c143](https://g.co/gemini/share/436be1c0c143)

My personal investment strategy is somewhat of a mix of buy and hold, and swing trading on the weeks/months time scale. My buy and hold investments like $NVDA, $NBIS etc are going with me to the grave.

However, for some tickers in my portfolio that are lower conviction, I have stop losses set. Many nearly got tripped today, and are right on the edge for whatever happens next week. For example I have some $INTC with a stop loss set at $35.11, just below a support level (~$36.40) that has stood intact for the past week.

Using $INTC as an example, would one remove a stop loss all together? Drop it to a lower S/R level (perhaps $24.5 before the big gap up on Sept 18)? Perhaps change nothing and let these events thin out the heard, and eat the losses.

79,NVDA,"[DD] RDDT $2.3M Full Family Port Yolo - BTFD, Betting The Family Dynasty","**TL;DR:** This selloff wasn't based on reduced ChatGPT citations. It was linked to political news (**Charlie Kirk** **RIP** → **Revenge of the 🌈 Bears** → **""Antifun""** (I don't want to end up on the FBI watchlist) **Terrorist Executive Order** → **Congressional hearing postponed** → **🌈 Bears cover before earnings** → **2x Fed rate cuts** → **December S&amp;P 500 inclusion** → **Dynasty**).

As a redditor of 16 years, I decided to cash in my years of redditing by full porting not only my account but my parents' as well into RDDT after having completely missed the 2024 rally. From the peak at $282, I expected a ""moderate"" pullback of 15% but was kicked in the balls with a 30% drawdown, wiping out $1mil in profits. Dad calls me asking me, should we should sell? I tell him, no, we buy more, and so we did.

Despite all the price target raises to $300, PT reiterates at $300, talks of negotiating a new AI deal with Google, high likelihood of settling with Anthropic in mediation, massive earnings beat, and guidance raise far beyond what the Street was expecting, RDDT continued to sell off far beyond a normal range when the rest of the market was continuing to rip to new ATHs day after day. The reduced ChatGPT citation news then came out of nowhere and dropped RDDT another 15% despite having already corrected 15% from the peak. And over the past few days, RDDT continued on the struggle bus with the market ripping.

Something felt off. And so, I decided to add some *wrinkles* to my smoothe brain.



# 🧠 What My Smoothe Brain Thought Was the 🌈 Bear Case

* **“RDDT was overbought.”** *Sure, the stock had run up a lot (relative strength was high). A cooldown was expected. This might explain a* ***normal*** *correction, but not a 30% crash on high volume. Even the 0 revenue quantum stocks hasn't corrected this much in this rate cutting cycle environment.*
* **Decrease in DAU** on sites like Semrush:
   * *Google eliminated the num=100 parameter which broke search result tracking sites and resulted in web traffic drops across all sites.* [Citizens](https://markets.financialcontent.com/stocks/article/marketminute-2025-10-3-reddit-rebounds-analysts-dismiss-ai-fears-as-data-licensing-and-ad-growth-drive-optimism) *even pointed this out in their report, but still no sustainable bounce.*
* **ChatGPT reduction in citations**:
   * [Sam Altman directly/indirectly owns 8.7% of RDDT](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/29/sam-altmans-reddit-stake-now-worth-over-1-billion-after-earnings-pop.html)*, so a complete reversal of his opinion on reddit seemed unlikely to me, unlike what several headlines and analysts suggested.*
   * *ChatGPT citations alone don't bring that much traffic to reddit and only account for 5% of RDDT's revenue, so another 15% drop seemed too much especially in the context of a* [new deal being negotiated with Google](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/reddit-stock-ai-deal-google-openai/)*. OpenAI doesn't want Google to have a monopoly relationship over reddit like it does with* [Apple](https://www.barrons.com/articles/apple-stock-price-google-search-trial-774f4774?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAi2Aepz4YfkUzHlyW43XKFw5jYgLonf0RqC-XMCO1XblHovzKcMOxODMv7rkOY%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68e8ec3f&amp;gaa_sig=aoxKHEAywLIAKYAhJQLXOxevRchLEJ2gA5pO3e7p5VMHy7uJWtgMMSjRJ6U0IHEz5ppiUJPdvwSLlSbFSJdOUQ%3D%3D)*.*
   * *We all learned in high school not to cite Wikipedia, but we still use it because it's useful. Imagine our teachers' faces when reddit comments were being cited by ChatGPT as primary sources. Just because reddit isn't cited, doesn't mean it's not being used at all.*

This entire selloff just seemed too much for RDDT to drop after such stellar earnings and even stronger guidance in this environment where the [MEME ETF ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meme-stock-resurgence-prompts-return-184355645.html)returned from the grave and ARKK is up 61% YTD. It just didn't make sense.

This was when my smoothe brain formed its first wrinkle. I then remembered there was a non-sense hearing scheduled for 10:00am on Oct. 8 which I ignored the first time around. It sounded like it'd be a meme hearing when I imagined u/spez, Gaben, Discord, and Twitch testifying in front of Congress. I also figured out it wasn't going to happen due to the government shutdown as this was the most non-essential government hearing that I've ever heard of.

Despite all this, RDDT continued to dump 5% and on Oct. 8 right at 10:00am on the day of the originally scheduled hearing when it was clear the hearing was postponed, RDDT bounced. I thought to myself, did we actually bounce because the hearing was canceled. **Then it clicked. My second wrinkle** popped into existence. I downed my Red Bulls and put together this timeline.

# 🤯From Smoothe Brain to Wrinkley Brain

After putting together this timeline and matching it up against the way RDDT has been moving over the past 3 weeks, everything made so much more sense. There were enough examples of global radicalism linked to social media, to the point it spooked bulls.

The smart money took profits and the **🌈** Bears shorted RDDT bigly, betting that u/spez would be crucified at the hearing. At the hearing, **Spez would be in a lose/lose situation** where his only option would be to confirm that reddit does not allow doxxing, bans users who threaten violence, etc. and **agree to do whatever the Congressional circus** demands him to do, otherwise, **they would threaten to remove reddit's** [**Section 230 immunity**](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R46751) which would **result in reddit being liable** as a publisher for what redditors post. **A death sentence ☠️ for reddit and all social media companies**.

This would of course be perceived by redditors as a capitulating on free speech, and I'm sure many redditors would threaten to leave. Spez also can't pull a Zuck and donate to Trump as this would piss off most redditors even more.

The concession I speculate Spez made was by proactively sunsetting of public chats. While I find this feature is helpful at times for subreddits like r/redditstock, I don't use it much personally but I know other redditors love it. What I can see happening is bad actors using it for nefarious purposes. It wouldn't surprise me if there may have been a few ""Antifun"" individuals who abused this community function which resulted in getting this feature disabled for everyone.

In the context of these outbreaks of violence with social media being used by bad actors, I speculate that Sam Altman, an 8.7% shareholder of RDDT and former reddit CEO of 4 days, may have expedited an update to reduce reddit citations given that only a month prior, reddit was frequently cited making up 41% of LLM citations. Or this was pure coincidence but the timing just seemed a bit sus. Either way, Altman wouldn't want to risk being on Trump's shitlist and risk Trump accusing ChatGPT of being woke due to a high citation percentage of reddit. That would risk development of Star Gate.

What I completely disagree with is commentary from some analysts who argued that reddit data and OpenAI's relationship with reddit is any less valuable after this change. Reddit is incredibly valuable for sentiment analysis and for verifying if a product with thousands of 5 star reviews is actually legitimate. Like random ass Chinese bluetooth headphones from Xyrbx with a 4.95 rating and over 3,000 reviews. Reddit sentiment analysis would easily flag that as being fake af.



# 🔬Testing My Theory

If my interpretation of the timeline holds true, I thought that one way to test this is to see how META moved during this time, even though they weren't invited for the hearing. And look, META and RDDT's movement look quite similar. The major risk to all social media companies is if Trump were to threaten the removal of Section 230 immunity . But with the ""Antifun"" terrorist designation, well, that causes an even bigger problem for all social media companies.

AMZN (Twitch/Hassan Piker) and NFLX (streaming service of Money Heist which popularized the song Bella Ciao which was declared to be the anthem of ""Antifun"") also moved similarly to RDDT and META since September. All 4 stocks started to recover yesterday as I believe ""Antifun"" short covering started.

And if there was a lot of fear with civil uprisings, I thought, why not look into opening up a trade in guns and gold if you have govenment topplings happen. Gun stocks are up 30% from September, and GLD is at the moon. So yes, there was a clear systematic trade that bet on all this and those trades are reversing.



# 💎💰🚀The Trade Thesis

The **🌈** Bears positioned for an Oct 8 hearing without realizing that the hearing was postponed due to the government shutdown. After seeing that the ""Antifun"" roundtable didn't trigger a full on collapse below yesterday's support, this signaled that the ""Antifun"" trade bottomed out and the covering started. Options flow yesterday showed a lot of puts being sold and the return of 🐂🐳Bull whales with **$7.5M** in **210 and 220 strike June 2027 calls** which sparked a lot more call buying and confirmation of the bull flag breakout.

There are still a lot more **🌈** Bears who haven't made this ""Antifun"" short connection and still think all of this is related to RDDT being a meme, is no longer useful to AI, and will miss on earnings. They're about to get blown out as **Polymarket puts the shutdown ending after 10/15 at 85% odds**. RDDT earnings is on Oct 30, so there is only a limited window for the hearing to be scheduled before earnings. I actually see **RDDT as a hedge for a prolonged shutdown** as this just delays the upcoming hearing.

With \~16-18% short interest, RDDT's tiny float, and an earnings blackout period coming up, the time is now to give the **🌈** Bears a new gap. With an expected earnings blow out and the hearing having already been priced in, I think we'll break to new ATHs post earnings. I do expect a moderate pullback once the hearing is officially rescheduled but view the hearing as a buy the news event.

After a new ATH and 2 back-to-back rate cuts, this would make RDDT a top contender for S&amp;P 500 inclusion in the December S&amp;P 500 balancing. RDDT was skipped in September despite the 4 consecutive quarters of profit. Just look at how APP and HOOD ripped after the inclusion. Except this would be during the Santa Claus rally and complete index rebalancing in the last trading day of December. 🚀🚀🚀

3️⃣ Earnings growth remains the key driver: Adjusted EPS for the S&amp;P 500 is expected to grow from $246 in 2024 to $262 in 2025 and $280 in 2026. This steady earnings expansion underpins the rally, though EPS growth may lag behind index gains — suggesting potential valuation expansion.

63,NVDA,🚀🚀 $CCCX – The SPAC That Gets You NVIDIA’s QUANTUM PARTNER on the Cheap 🚀🚀,"Alright, you degens, listen up. I’ve been digging through the garbage pile of SPACs and found a goddamn diamond. Forget your money-burning penny stonks and quantum meme stocks with no revenue. I’m talking about Churchill Capital Corp X ($CCCX), and it’s our ticket to the quantum tendie-verse.

**The DD (strap in, this is the good part):**

So, what is this thing? $CCCX is a SPAC that’s merging with a company called Infleqtion. Who the hell is Infleqtion? Only the most legit neutral atom quantum computing company on the block. And here’s the kicker: they are a direct partner with our lord and savior, NVIDIA ($NVDA).

The Deal: CCCX is taking Infleqtion public at a $1.8 billion valuation. They are on track to be listed under the ticker ""INFQ"".

This isn't some pre-revenue garbage fire. While other ""quantum"" stocks are trading at insane fantasy valuations, Infleqtion is the real deal.

* $IONQ: 133x Price/Sales
* $RGTI: 897x Price/Sales
* $QUBT: 10,250x Price/Sales (not a typo, check for yourself)

Meanwhile, $CCCX/Infleqtion is coming in at a sane 34.5x P/S. You're getting a 1,000%+ discount to its moron peers.

**The NVIDIA Connection &amp; Real Business**

This is the alpha. Infleqtion isn't just using Nvidia's stuff; they are a highlighted strategic partner. Nvidia has showcased them at GTC events and in their own developer blogs for their CUDA-Q platform. When Jensen Huang's company is giving you the nod, you pay attention. They even ran the first-ever logical qubit experiment using Nvidia's platform. This is DEEP integration.

Unlike 99% of the SPAC trash, Infleqtion has **ACTUAL REVENUE**:

* $29 million in real, hard cash revenue (not promises).
* 3 quantum computers SOLD and delivered.
* Hundreds of sensors already deployed in the field.
* $300 million customer pipeline.
* Clients? Oh, just some small names like the U.S. Department of Defense, NASA, the U.K. Government, and... NVIDIA ITSELF.

Even the notorious short-sellers at Citron Research are bullish on this one. They literally said, ""Infleqtion has customers, revenue, and NVIDIA validation."" They see the massive opportunity the rest of the market is sleeping on.

**The Government Catalyst (Here's the real juice)**

Now, get this. The White House is about to pour jet fuel on this fire. They're drafting executive orders to fast-track quantum tech adoption across the ENTIRE U.S. government, focused on national security and post-quantum cryptography (PQC). They're not just funding university research, they're mandating that federal agencies upgrade their systems ASAP to defend against quantum attacks. [thequantuminsider+2](https://thequantuminsider.com/2025/09/20/reports-white-house-prepares-executive-actions-on-quantum-tech-and-post-quantum-cybersecurity/)

Who benefits? Not the pre-revenue demo quantum shit-stonk companies. The government needs proven, deployable tech, not science projects. They need companies that can deliver yesterday. [spinquanta](https://www.spinquanta.com/news-detail/quantum-computer-companies-to-invest-in-why-spinq-technology-leads-the-future-of-quantum-computing)

That’s Infleqtion. They are already selling to the DoD and NASA. They have the hardware and the security focus the government is demanding. While $IONQ and $RGTI are busy trying to convince investors they have a product while insiders dump like crazy, Infleqtion is already embedded with the exact agencies that will be getting billions in mandates to buy this tech. The EOs are a direct pipeline of government cash to companies that can execute, and Infleqtion is at the front of the line. [cyberscoop+1](https://cyberscoop.com/trump-administration-quantum-computing-executive-action/)

**Why This Is Going to Print**

Look, every regard on this sub is chasing AI. But what’s next? Quantum-powered AI. Barron's is already calling the current quantum market a ""bubble,"" with stocks like $QUBT dropping 10% on dilutive offerings and $RGTI missing targets after a 5,000% run-up.

Smart money is about to rotate from the overpriced, no-revenue garbage into the ONE name with a proven business model and a firehose of government money pointed right at it.

You're not buying a story here. You're buying into a real company with real tech, real revenue, and partnerships with both the most important tech company on the planet and the most powerful government. This is your chance to get in on the ground floor before the institutional FOMO kicks in and this thing goes parabolic.

**TL;DR:** $CCCX is merging with Nvidia's quantum partner, Infleqtion. They have real revenue, top-tier clients (DoD, NASA), and a stamp of approval from Nvidia. Impending government executive orders will funnel cash directly to them, not their speculative peers. Get in before the rockets leave without you.

**🚀 $CCCX MOONSHOT DD: CIA’s Quantum Ace + NVIDIA’s Secret Sauce 🚀**  
(Friday, October 10, 2025)

Good morning degens,

As I alluded to yesterday, this is the DD that’ll rewrite your portfolio - and The Street still hasn’t caught on. $CCCX isn’t just another SPAC - it’s the quantum unicorn handpicked by the CIA’s own venture arm (In-Q-Tel) and turbocharged by NVIDIA. Here’s why this is basically a 10-bagger in the making:

1. **CIA’S Midas Touch (Background of In-Q-Tel):** In-Q-Tel is the nonprofit VC arm of the U.S. CIA, founded to scout and fund breakthrough tech for national security. They’ve backed 800+ companies over 25 years, creating market legends like: – Palantir (PLTR): $2M seed → $430B market cap = 200,000x return – Keyhole → Google Earth: CIA-funded startup acquired by Google → multibillion-dollar product – Anduril: Early-stage backing → $30.5B valuation in 2025 – Databricks: Strategic partner → $43B unicorn

In-Q-Tel’s quantum winners average 1000x+ returns. This is literally how fortunes are made.

1. **WHY THEY BACKED INFLEQTION – Quantum = National Security:** Biden’s whole-of-government memo &amp; CIA nominee call quantum “pivotal to our future.” Governments pay top dollar for stealth detection &amp; code-breaking tech. Trump will further back this race with quantum-related executive orders. Infleqtion’s quantum sensors are already fielded by DoD, NASA, and UK gov - real revenue, not vaporware. CIA investment ensures U.S. and her allies stay top dog in the quantum arms race.
2. **NVIDIA SUPERCHARGE – First Logical Qubit Demo:** Infleqtion + NVIDIA CUDA-Q nailed the first-ever materials-science experiment on logical qubits. Joint demos with top universities proved massive performance gains. NVIDIA showcases Infleqtion at GTC events and in dev blogs - only their top-tier partners get that flex. (Easter egg: NVIDIA’s Group Product Manager for Quantum Computing is leading a talk on “Accelerating Quantum Computing Breakthroughs” on Oct 28.) NVIDIA isn’t just demo-ing - they’re buying Infleqtion’s quantum sensors.  [https://www.nvidia.com/gtc/dc/sessions/quantum-computing-and-hpc/](https://www.nvidia.com/gtc/dc/sessions/quantum-computing-and-hpc/)
3. **THE PERFECT STORM – Dual Validation:** CIA says “this tech is mission-critical,” NVIDIA says “we’ll power it.” Unlike IONQ/RGTI burning cash, Infleqtion has real gov revenue, a $200M+ pipeline, and a $540M+ war chest from the SPAC. The CEO plans to deploy this cash for strategic quantum acquisitions and talent expansion. $INFQ shares can swallow private quantum rivals who can’t get CIA or NVIDIA backing.
4. **WHY YOU DON’T NEED TO USE YOUR AMYGDALA, FOCUS ON PATTERN RECOGNITION:** In-Q-Tel quantum winners gave birth to Palantir, Anduril, Google Earth, Databricks - all 1000x+ cases. This Isn’t speculation or emotional, it’s pattern recognition. CIA doesn’t back losers. NVIDIA doesn’t partner with losers. Infleqtion is the quantum unicorn they both trust.

Degens, strap in and hold tight, because this quantum rocket is fueled by the CIA’s playbook and NVIDIA’s firepower, and there’s no turning back once ignition hits. 🌕🚀💎

328,NVDA,"Intel gives first look at next-gen chips, says Arizona fab is fully operational","Intel on Thursday announced its new PC chips slated to debut in laptops next year as the chipmaker battles to turn around its struggling business.

The company said the new Panther Lake processor is made with its 18A technology and is the most advanced node made on U.S. soil.

The new generation of chips will be made at Intel’s Fab 52 facility in Arizona, which the company said is now fully operational and set to ramp production.

“The United States has always been home to Intel’s most advanced R&amp;D, product design and manufacturing – and we are proud to build on this legacy as we expand our domestic operations and bring new innovations to the market,” CEO Lip-Bu Tan said in a release announcing the news.

Intel’s latest reveal comes during a critical stretch for the beleaguered chipmaker that has lagged in recent years and struggled to keep up with cutting-edge chip demands spurred by the artificial intelligence revolution.

In August, the U.S. government took a 10% stake in the company in an effort to beef up U.S. manufacturing capabilities. Intel has also received investments from SoftBank and AI chipmaking giant Nvidia.

Since taking the helm of Intel in March, Tan has faced massive pressure to deliver.

This summer, President Donald Trump called Tan “highly CONFLICTED” and demanded his resignation, but later changed his tone.

Intel shares have bounced 87% this year.

68,NVDA,"Nvidia can rally nearly 60% as AI infrastructure market swells, says Cantor Fitzgerald","There are still big gains to be had in [Nvidia](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/), according to Cantor Fitzgerald.

The investment firm raised its price target on the graphics processing unit maker to $300 from $240, implying that shares could surge 59%. Cantor also kept its overweight rating on the stock.

While renewed interest in the AI trade has driven Nvidia to new highs recently, analyst C.J. Muse asserted that the stock’s long-term prospects still look solid. Supporting this point is the fact that AI token demand has “exploded” in the past 12 to 16 weeks.

“We are still in the early innings of a multi-trillion AI Infrastructure build-out with just the Hyperscalers providing significant line-of-sight into hundreds of billions of demand for the next handful of years, never mind other drivers such as Neo-Clouds, Enterprise, and Physical AI,” he wrote. “Thus, this is not a bubble, and we are still in the early innings of this investment cycle.”

Muse believes that token generation could drive the AI infrastructure market to between $3 to $4 trillion in 2030.

The analyst also pointed to Nvidia’s [new partnership with OpenAI](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/22/nvidia-openai-data-center.html) as a catalyst. In this partnership, Nvidia will invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI as the ChatGPT maker plans to build and deploy Nvidia systems that require 10 gigawatts of power.

“What is unique to the “new” relationship is to help OpenAI stand up as its own self-hosted hyperscaler … truly a win-win for both, with the option to invest in OpenAI an added benefit to NVDA,” Muse wrote.

303,NVDA,US Approves Nvidia GPU Sales to UAE Worth Up to $20 Billion a Year,"The U.S. government has approved Nvidia to export advanced AI GPUs such as the H100 and newer Blackwell models to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and potentially other Middle Eastern buyers.  
The approval reportedly stems from a broader U.S.–UAE AI partnership, allowing Nvidia to sell high-end chips to companies like G42, which has deep ties to AI research and regional infrastructure projects.

# 💰 Estimated Financial Impact

* Annual export cap: up to 500,000 GPUs
* Estimated unit price: up to $40,000 per GPU
* Annual max revenue: $20 billion
* 3-year potential (2025–2027): $60 billion
* 6-year extended potential (through 2030): $120 billion

While official reports (Reuters, Bloomberg) only describe “several-billion-dollar” exports, the maximum potential value based on full annual allocation and high-end chip pricing could reach $120 billion over a six-year term.

I've held it for a couple years, added some, sold some, mostly just held steady.

Often I was disappointed with their lack of ability to capitalize on the AI GPU demand. I know, from what people say, that NVDAs software and existing partnerships were rock solid bud god damn did it seem like AMD was dropping the ball.

Now it seems like NVDA is so incredibly capacity constrained AND that customers want to diversify their supply chain so badly that we're finally seeing the sales start to shift over.

352,NVDA,🚀 C3.AI — THE AI STOCK EVERYONE GAVE UP ON... RIGHT BEFORE IT GOES NUCLEAR? 💥💥💥,"Alright degenerates, gather ‘round.  
While everyone’s drooling over NVDA, there’s a forgotten AI stock sitting in the dumpster — $AI (C3.AI).  
Missed earnings? Yup. Clown management? Definitely.  
But now the setup looks juicier than your ex’s DMs at 2 AM.

**Why this could send shorts to the ER:**

🧠 **New CEO — Stephen Ehikian.**  
Built and sold AI companies to **Salesforce**, then worked in the **Trump administration**. Translation: this man knows how to play both *Silicon Valley and Washington*. Imagine if AI contracts start flying around again in election season…

🤝 **Big-boy partners** — **Amazon, Microsoft, Google.**  
Their enterprise suite actually *reduces inventory waste and predicts demand*. (AKA the opposite of my trading account.)

📈 **Short interest = juiced.**  
Call OI stacked at $20–$23. Options flow is looking like someone’s loading the nuke.  
Even a small catalyst could spark a **gamma squeeze** that melts faces.

💬 **Market narrative:** AI hype cooled off, but that’s when the next rerating wave starts. If $AI prints one solid quarter or lands a federal/enterprise deal, bears get obliterated.

🧨 TL;DR

* Beaten down AI stock ✔️
* New politically connected CEO ✔️
* High short interest + call flow ✔️
* Partners with AMZN/MSFT ✔️
* Election-season AI narrative ✔️

Risk: high.  
Reward: **WSB-poster-boy status** if this thing pops. 💎🤲

84,NVDA,30K YOLO on uiPATH - The $PATH to generational wealth,"Greetings fellow crayon eaters, if you’ve been missing this AI bubble that is just getting started, then you’re a pathetic loser. *BUT you’re in luck*, because i’m here to present you with a play that is ready to run 1000%, and is actually… dare i say, UNDERVALUED in this market environment. Only up 18% YTD? Pathetic. This has the potential for upwards of **$40-50** ***THIS YEAR***

The ticker? $PATH

And it's your PATH to finally getting a  taste of the big gains this market has to offer.

**What the fuck does PATH do?**

In short, PATH builds Robotic Process Automations (RPAs) to automate repetitive tasks. Meaning, path will probably build the AI that runs the robot that replaces you, so hopefully your wife’s boyfriend can support you both. For more details, search the fucking internet, idiot. I gotta keep it short enough for your attention span. 

**Why is PATH so beaten up?**

It came too early… *just like you*, loser. 

PATH went public in 2021 at $65.50 per share. It was seen as a next generation darling by Aunt Cathie Wood, and pumped to an all time high of 90. BUTTT…  the overall market and economy was not ready for what PATH had to offer: Robotics and AI. If you’re not brainrotted too much to remember 2021, the hype was EVs and green energy. Nobody gave a shit about AI or robotics. Then the 2022 bear market came and wiped the speculative stocks. PATH was a victim of that.

The nail in the coffin was May 29, 2024, when the company announced a CEO change and lowered their yearly guidance. The stock dropped 30% that day and still has a gap there. Aunt Cathie ended up selling for a loss… (you know what that means!) 

Since then it found a floor of $10 a share which it has tested multiple times.

https://preview.redd.it/rmbrdz23ovtf1.png?width=938&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f59af1605fcf421a3264968abe2ef0eef65d4ecd

**Today is a completely different story**.

PATH has stumbled into a fucking golden opportunity…. AI, robotics, and automation. They have weathered the storm of CEO change, and have established reliable income streams.

**2025 Partnerships:**

**As of October 2025, PATH has established new partnerships with:**

**Nvidia, OpenAI, Salesforce, and Snowflake. Yeah thats right, the motherfucking work horses of the modern market, NVDA and OPENAI**

This is IN ADDITION to their existing partnerships and clients: Microsoft, Google Cloud, SAP, and Amazon. 

**Earnings trends:** *PATH has beat revenue expectations 8 times in a row… and beat EPS expectations 7 of the last 8 earnings.* 

https://preview.redd.it/d8x0jx17ovtf1.png?width=917&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e38c9aa90ea87072a1fe66d38c756b2a98dbe32

**What’s next?**

PATH has projected both EPS and revenue growth. The best part? Projections have not been raised since the new partnerships, meaning PATH is poised to surprise to the upside for earnings in December, and the market is *just now beginning to price that in.*

**TA / Options pricing - THIS IS BIG**

Bullish all time macD reversal with a gap to fill at $19. Resistance at 15, but setup to break through it after four tests by bulls in the past year, and recently with incredible volume not seen since the gap down from the CEO leaving, indicating big money is poised to capture the upside. 

***IV is considerably low at for at the money options when compared to the IV of other AI stocks, it’s currently sitting at 60-75%. This is HUGE. Options are currently critically undervalued for a stock that is poised to break to the upside and be major AI play for the year.*** 

In comparison, other market AI darlings like RZLV iv 141% for at the money, APLD 137%, SOUN 110%, RR 190%

*For you smooth brains, this means call option prices have room to absolutely skyrocket once this breaks out.* 

Current short interest per fintel is 12%. Short interest can help drive the upside breakout as shorts look to exit near 5 year lows as Bulls once again take charge.

Since dropping to $10 a share, we can see from the volume profile that there has been significant accumulation of shares in the $10-14 range, and we are just beginning to break away from that into a volume gap that will eventually take the stock into the $20's

It's just broken over the 200D MA and backtested it, bouncing hard following a small dip from profit taking after the NVDA partnership announcement.

53,NVDA,Saw this Goldman report comparing today’s market to past bubbles,"People have been arguing about whether Big Tech and AI stocks are in a bubble or not.

And recently I came across a [Goldman Sachs note](https://www.goldmansachs.com/pdfs/insights/goldman-sachs-research/25-years-on-lessons-from-the-bursting-of-the-tech-bubble/redaction.pdf) from back in Apr 2025 that compared this market to earlier “bubble” periods to the dot-com era, Japan in the late 80s, and the old Nifty 50 names.

One table (Exhibits 7) shows the current “Magnificent 7” (AAPL, NVDA, MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL, META, TSLA) trading around **23× forward P/E**, while the 2000 tech leaders were at **52×**. 

Another table (Exhibits 8) points out they’re way more profitable and have cleaner balance sheets (ROE about 44% vs 28% back then, and most of them sit on net cash).

Not saying I fully agree, but it’s an interesting comparison.

&gt;Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence startup xAI is raising more financing than initially planned, tapping backers including Nvidia Corp. to lift its ongoing funding round to $20 billion, according to people with knowledge of the matter.

&gt;The financing includes equity and debt in a special purpose vehicle that will buy Nvidia processors and rent them to xAI for use in its Colossus 2 project, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. That’s the name of its largest data center site, which is located in Memphis.

&gt;Nvidia is investing as much as $2 billion in the equity portion of the transaction, the people said, a strategy by the chipmaker that helps accelerate its customers’ AI investments.

54,NVDA,AMD and OpenAI - A raw deal for AMD,"So, we've had a little time to digest this deal, what's it all about? 

Lisa Su, in her infinite wisdom, [has granted OpenAI warrants](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0000002488/000119312525230895/d28189d8k.htm) to purchase up to 10% of AMD stock. The purchase price? One penny per share. Can you buy AMD stock at that price? I don't think you can. So why exactly is Sam Altman, hereafter referred to as Sammy, allowed to buy at this price? Read on.

Sammy is granted tranches of warrants to purchase AMD stock for one penny, subject to vesting standards. According to what has been disclosed so far, the first tranche vests after delivery of one gigawatt of GPUs. So Sammy has to buy this first batch before it gets any stock. But don't worry, Lisa has confidence Sammy will have the money to buy them (courtesy of Jensen et al.). Vesting of the remaining tranches of warrants are ""further subject to achievement of specified Company stock price targets that escalate to $600 per share for the final tranche and stock performance thresholds"". 

So what's going on here? This looks like a vendor financing arrangement, not unlike NVDA's recently announced gift of cash to Sammy. Except instead of funding the gift to Sammy with cash, which Lisa doesn't have, she's funding it with stock, i.e. dilution of AMD shareholders. For the uninitiated, you are paying for this. So, Sammy gets free stock, which he's free to sell at any time. He doesn't make any money and he needs enormous amounts of cash to fund his chip purchases, so what would he do with this stock? Probably sell it yeah? And what on earth would he do with the money from the stock sales? I dunno, buy the AMD chips he promised to buy maybe? Who then paid for these chips that Sammy now has in his possession? If you're an AMD shareholder, you did, and you probably didn't benefit because you got diluted for it. Okay well how much money are we talking here? Sammy has warrants for 160 million of AMD stock, the final tranche vests at $600. Why that number, what's the significance? Hmmmm... let me see..... carry the two... square root of four.... does Pi get involved here? No, I don't think Pi is needed.... oh yeah, it's about $100 billion, the same number Jensen just gave Sammy.

Why is Lisa doing this? Why is Lisa telling her shareholders they should be giving their money to Sammy? I suppose the (not very) plausible explanation is that it gives AMD street cred. If Sammy can run his workloads on AMD chips then that's great right? Other companies will surely see that AMD is competitive with NVDA and buy AMD chips without special, zero cost, financing arrangements. To the moon! Maybe. The more retail investors bid up AMD stock, the more tranches of warrants will vest and the more they themselves will fund Sammy's chips. And I'll remind you, you've already done that, yesterday and today. Sammy basically loses nothing here. You, as a shareholder, are buying his chips and you don't even get an equity stake for it. 

Now, Jensen did something very similar, and he has cash so he has a bit more bargaining power. He at least gets an equity stake for that $100 billion of your money. And maybe you're fine with that, who knows. And what's that stake worth? Whatever you can dream up. Maybe zero, maybe 6 quadrillion, or anywhere in between.

So, that's the deal. All of these circular financing deals get confusing don't they? Who ends up footing the bill for Lisa and Jensen's exploits? Could it possibly be... you as a shareholder? Certainly looks that way.",73,58,1759882508.0,2025-10-08T00:15:08+00:00,t3_1o0vuae,stocks

306,NVDA,$POET - Someone Just Dropped $75M In and Won't Say Who (We Find Out Oct 17),"Alright so I've been digging into this POET Technologies thing because of that dumb fuck who keeps posting shit about them in the DDs so I said what the hell I'll take a look.

POET makes optical chips that connect GPUs in AI data centers. Not the GPUs themselves, the networking shit between them. Everyone's throwing money at NVIDIA for the chips but nobody's paying attention to the fact that when you have thousands of these things clustered together they need to talk to each other at insane speeds. That's what POET does, optical interconnects for 800G, 1.6T speeds and up.

So on October 7th (to-fucking-day) they announced they raised $75M. Biggest investment in their history. But here's the thing... they won't say who gave them the money. Just says ""a single institutional investor"" in the press release. No broker, no finder's fee, straight direct placement.

When I saw that I was like wait what? Companies don't usually hide this shit unless there's a reason. And when you do a direct placement with no intermediaries that usually means you already know each other, like this isn't some random fund that saw your pitch deck.

The timing is what really got my attention though. OpenAI announces that massive AMD deal on October 6th, literally the day before. POET just launched their 1.6T optical receivers with Semtech on Sept 30. They got their first real production order in September for over $500K, yeah I know that's fucking peanuts. Their Malaysia manufacturing facility just came online. Everything is happening right now and then they get a mystery $75M investment.

I started thinking about who needs optical interconnects right now. OpenAI is building out 6 gigawatts with AMD and 10 gigawatts with NVIDIA, they absolutely need this shit. NVIDIA has been throwing billions at AI infrastructure companies but they don't have any optical interconnect plays in their portfolio. Microsoft needs to secure OpenAI's supply chain. Amazon and Google are behind and trying to catch up. Every major player in AI needs what POET makes.

And it's not vaporware, Foxconn selected them for their 800G and 1.6T modules. Semtech co-developed products with them and did a joint announcement. They're shipping samples to three major tech companies right now. Semtech wouldn't put their name on it if it was bullshit.

If someone bought 15% of the company, which is about what $75M gets you at $5.50 per share, they legally have to file with the SEC within 10 days. It's called a 13D or 13G filing. The deadline is October 17th. That filing has to show who they are, how much they bought, whether it's passive or strategic, all of it.

So in 10 days we're going to know if this was NVIDIA, OpenAI, Microsoft, Amazon, whoever. If it's one of them this stock is going to fucking moon because it validates everything. If it's just some random growth fund then whatever. I'm here for the fucking casino.

Now look I'm not an idiot, there's a bear case here. Company has been around since 1972 and they're basically still pre-revenue, they did like $268K last quarter. They've lost $214M over their lifetime. They've raised $227M in the last 2 years alone, constant dilution.

But someone just put $75M directly into this company right as everything is coming together. No intermediaries. Right as production is scaling. Right as OpenAI is making major chip diversification moves. The structure looks exactly like the OpenAI-AMD deal with the warrants out to 2030. Either this is the luckiest timing ever or something's going on.

Position: I like to gamble so I picked up 1,000 $10C 10/31. I'm betting it all on a big partnership.

65,NVDA,To Roll Or Not To Roll?! 🎲📈🚀❓,"...THAT IS THE QUESTION!! 👋 What's good, degenerates?! I need a sanity check before I YOLO myself into another “learning experience.”  I actually don't think  I'm wrecked here,  but I think I could be positioned better.

Play #1: SOFI $26C 10/10 .. grabbed it before realizing earnings are end of month.. . Thinking about rolling to 11/7 or 11/14 now that I know.. Been studying options for like 3 years now.. . dabbled in LEAPS and sell covered calls on my long SOUN position.. Had a couple good ones.. and a few that slapped me back to reality. Fast forward to now.. this one's IV looks hella juicy.. I get to see how a short-term call moves.. I can afford to lose max loss.. and I’m confident SOFI’s gonna climb.. . This option stood out as my quick-gain play.. not too much risk but a little thrill. I'm just wondering if there’s more upside holding till right before earnings on the 28th or if it’s smarter to take profit and reset before the run-up.. So it’s not “will these print?” it’s “will I print more if I roll past earnings and is it worth the cost?”  Should I snag a call expiring November 7th or 14th in the AM? Or would it even be smarter to just turn this into a whole ass LEAP and go Jan 2026? If anybody could teach me the mechanics behind choosing the most profitable expiration for your strategy and situation? And if there is any useful wisdom or rules of thumb to be told about expirations or the Greeks—please... I'm listening!!! 

Play #2: RR (Richtech Robotics) $6C 10/31 .. yeah, I bought high.. yes, it’s red.. . but I’m betting on a pop going into the NVIDIA conference on the 27th.. . Rumor is they’re showing off a new humanoid robot.. . If I plan to exit a few days before, is it better to keep the close expiry or roll out for less decay?

Appreciate any wisdom from the cult of the green line.. Let’s print,  homies! 🚀",5,25,1759804521.0,2025-10-07T02:35:21+00:00,t3_1o02zdj,SmallStreetBets

72,NVDA,AMD flying - OpenAI and chipmaker AMD sign chip supply partnership for AI infrastructure,"In case you missed this today in the pre-market action. 



Under the terms of the deal, OpenAI will buy the latest version of the company's high performance graphics chips, the Instinct MI450, which is expected to debut next year.

The agreement calls for supplying 6 gigawatts of computing power for OpenAI’s “next generation” AI infrastructure, with the first batch of chips worth 1 gigawatt to be deployed in the second half of 2026.

AMD also issued OpenAI with a warrant allowing the AI company to buy up to 160 million shares of AMD’s common stock. That amounts to about 10% of company based on AMD's 1.6 billion outstanding shares. The warrant will vest based on two milestones tied to the amount of computing power deployed, as well as unspecified “share-price targets.""

Shares of AMD spiked 25% before the opening bell Monday. Shares of Nvidia, which have repeatedly set new record-highs this year, fell slightly.

“This partnership is a major step in building the compute capacity needed to realize AI’s full potential,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, said in a news release. “AMD’s leadership in high-performance chips will enable us to accelerate progress and bring the benefits of advanced AI to everyone faster.”

The deal is a boost for Santa Clara, Calif.-based AMD, which has been left behind by rival [Nvidia](https://apnews.com/article/openai-nvidia-investment-partnership-chatgpt-610d894d93f9be23c46762950997a67f). But it also hints at OpenAI's desire to diversify its supply chain away from Nvidia's dominance. The AI boom has fuelled demand for Nvidia's graphics processing chips, sending its shares soaring and making it the world's most valuable company.

Last month, OpenAI and [Nvidia](https://apnews.com/article/nvidia-artificial-intelligence-boom-bubble-42657a49554bf35fb12fdf48c02287d2) announced a $100 billion partnership that will add at least 10 gigawatts of data center computing power.

# Market Impact

Shares jumped from Friday's close of **$164.67** to over **$205** in pre-market trading. This partnership validates AMD's AI infrastructure investments and positions the company as a core strategic partner to one of the world's leading AI companies, breaking Nvidia's market dominance.

335,NVDA,OpenAI targets 10% AMD stake via multibillion-dollar chip deal,"OpenAI targets 10% AMD stake via multibillion-dollar chip deal - https://on.ft.com/3VR0B9G via @FT

OpenAI has agreed to buy tens of billions of dollars’ worth of chips from AMD as part of a deal that could also see the ChatGPT maker take a roughly 10 per cent stake in the $270bn chipmaker over time.

The San Francisco-based artificial intelligence start-up said on Monday it had agreed to purchase processors with a total power consumption of 6 gigawatts, roughly equivalent to Singapore’s average demand.

The companies did not put a total dollar figure on the transaction, but OpenAI executives estimate that 1GW of capacity costs about $50bn to bring online, with two-thirds of that spent on chips and the infrastructure to support them.

The deal comes just a fortnight after AMD’s rival Nvidia announced it planned to invest $100bn in OpenAI, with the two companies pledging to deploy 10GW of new data centre capacity.

AMD has also issued OpenAI a warrant to purchase as many as 160mn shares at an exercise price of $0.01 over time based on AMD “achieving certain share price targets” and OpenAI deploying its chips. That would equate to roughly 10 per cent of the company.

The transaction is the latest intended to accelerate OpenAI’s development of new data centres to train and power its AI models, and to ensure the group’s central position in the race to build the cutting-edge technology.

“This partnership is a major step in building the compute capacity needed to realise AI’s full potential,” OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman said.",726,288,1759748458.0,2025-10-06T11:00:58+00:00,t3_1nzfx09,stocks

Here is how I interpret the situation.

IONQ company:

* Current market cap: 20 billion 
* Has negative net income: -331m in 2024, -176m in Q2 2025
* Miserable gross revenue: 43m in 2024, 20m in Q2 2025
* The dilution is going crazy: Q1 2025 - 25m shares printed. Q2 2025 - 49m (almost $3billion from market cap in one quater) 

What I see in CEO actions:

* Appointed as CEO in 2025
* In Q1-Q2 of 2025 was awarded almost the same amount of $$$ in shares as the whole gross revenue of IONQ in 2024
* The dude goes public and says: “We are the next Nvidia”, “We will make billions in the future”.  
* Stock makes an insane 600%
* The new CEO sells most of his holdings from before 2025, yet in 2025, he gets a massive amount of new shares

What I think:

It is true, he did not sell any of his CEO stock. In fact, in 2025, while being CEO, he got more than a million new shares. I guess that he will get even more in 2025-2026. In this way, his number of shares and stake would remain the same as before 2025, but he managed to print more than 100 million $ in cash on quantum hype. 

This is more than the projected revenue of IONQ for 2025, which is between $82 million and $100 million (and remember, net is still negative) 

Quite a good deal.

338,NVDA,How do you see the whole AI bubble playing out?,"OpenAI, Anthropic, etc. are entrenched in Google Cloud, AWS, Azure, Oracle, Dell, whatever. They are significantly driving up the cloud revenue of these companies, which in turn buy from Nvidia. Investors keep pouring billions into the AI companies, which keep engaging in price wars with each other and spend whatever little they have left on R&amp;D and paying absurdly high salaries in the name of superintelligence.

When, not if,  this bubble bursts and investor funding dries up for the unprofitable companies, what the hell happens? Call me naive but I just don't see a world where chatgpt doesn't exist anymore or one where people use less AI in the future. Even though the LLM companies are not ideal investments, their products are ridiculously good and it is no secret that all the corporations in the world, say in 10 years, will have significantly higher automation than it does today.

My guess is that these big ones (example OpenAI) are almost too big to fail. If there are concerns about liquidity Sundar or Satya or Zuck would probably swoop in to strike a deal with them. Given this assessment and the idea that the world tomorrow would use more AI than it does today, probably a good idea to invest in something like Dell I think, which is currently at a P/OCF of 13 and pouring large amounts into making data centers. In the alternative that some of these big ones fail, I still think there would be someone else to fill the gap and data center companies would stay afloat.

339,NVDA,IBM : the Nvidia of Quantum computing ?,"Hi everyone,

For a while now, I've been seeing a lot of people betting on quantum computers. I've noticed small companies whose stocks have gone up 10x in just a few months. Some are hoping to find the next gem that will lead this new world, which could be the next technological revolution.

Personally, I don't really understand this sector. I've been hearing about quantum computers for years, but it's true that the Nvidia wave, a simple graphics card company that became the world's largest market capitalization, to the point where a few thousand euros invested seven years ago would make you a millionaire today, has made people eager to bet on the next revolution.

I've done my own research on quantum computing, and when I listen to experts, it feels like it's still very far off, even though there's some ""experimental"" commercialization starting. These computers still make too many errors and don't meet the expected needs.

But in my research, one company keeps coming up when it comes to significant advancements in the sector: IBM. Yet, when I look at IBM's stock price, it's nowhere near the small-cap companies that have seen their stocks multiply by 10.

Today, I'm wondering if IBM, with its experience, technological advancements, and especially its financial resources, isn't the best-positioned company in this space.

However, I never see IBM mentioned in this sector. Worse, IBM is even excluded from sector-specific ETFs.

359,NVDA,Silver could be poised for a strong upswing after gold’s breakout,"The chart shows that after gold reaches a new all-time high, silver has often followed with strong rallies, with historical examples in 1972, 1978, 2007, and 2009.

The 1978 cycle was the strongest, with silver prices surging nearly eightfold within two years.

After the 2009 financial crisis, silver also outperformed its historical average significantly.

Since 2024, silver’s trend has tracked closely with the historical mean. If past patterns repeat, 2025–2026 could see a notable upward cycle.

**EDIT:** $190 break 🚀 +127% YTD.  
If you were looking for the second NVDA coming… I’ll just leave this here:  
2026E -&gt; P/E 25x, EPS $16.56 = **$414**.  
  
Little update on $MU:  
Since June I started being active online about stocks - before that I didn’t really care. But $MU was so undervalued and painfully overlooked that I had to start spreading the word ;P  
I even reported obvious “max pain pinning” to the SEC... a week later the stock moved. Some of my DD got reprinted, and now I even see people using terms I coined 😅  
I knew the wind of change was coming - that WS would finally see what I’ve been seeing for quite a while: the AI backbone, surging demand, and the death of the old “commodity cycle” mindset.  
Got banned on WSB for hyping a “boring” stock ;P (and I get it - in YOLO land, hyping something stable with actual pop potential isn’t exactly porn-loss-karma material).  
Since then $MU is up +71% (still undervalued imo), +112% YTD… and still freaking growing 🚀

This isn’t just a rebound story — it’s a full-blown supercycle. Government subsidies are cushioning fab buildouts, analysts are raising price targets, and institutions are piling into calls. Micron is trading way cheaper than Nvidia, but its growth is riding the exact same AI wave. As hyperscalers, data centers, and AI labs hoover up every bit of DRAM Micron can print, margins expand and profits rip higher. Bears are stuck clinging to “memory is cyclical” while they watch an AI-driven secular boom melt their short positions.

340,NVDA,PATH to Orchestration,"This morning, ahead of their Fusion conference in Las Vegas, UiPath released some massive press releases. The common theme across all of them - UiPath is partnering with the biggest tech companies to ensure that UiPath's workflow orchestration system, called Maestro, is at the top of its game and able to connect with the best agents and data tools.

They announced partnerships with Snowflake so that Snowflake's Cortex AI agent can integrate into Maestro. This is crucial as many of UiPath's customers have their data stored in Snowflake and will be leveraging their agents for data insights. They also announced huge partnerships with Google Gemini, OpenAI, and NVIDIA. I encourage you to read the press releases for yourself. 

Why is this so important? UiPath is not trying to create every AI agent from scratch - instead, they are building the platform that orchestrates all of the agents and robots at the top...like a Maestro does with a full string orchestra. This will allow UiPath to stay extremely nimble and allow their customers to have access to the best agents in the world - some of which will be built by other companies (CortexAI, NVIDIA) and others that will be in-house (UiPath's PeakAI).

I'm not suprised by these announcements - in my prior post with some detailed DD on PATH, I mentioned that they were already partnered with LangChain and Microsoft Copilot to break down any concerns of developing walled gardens. It's still early days in UiPath's second act; however, the path there is clear. If you are a believer that corporations will be building agentic automation into their workforce at scale, then you are bullish PATH. The company is carving out its spot as the agnostic platform (a.k.a. the Switzerland of automation) that will span across their customers' entire enterprises.",4,0,1759295938.0,2025-10-01T05:18:58+00:00,t3_1nuzqe0,stocks
341,NVDA,Nvidia Stock Manipulation,"
Edit: if you ever wanted to know when to buy a stock or sell, just look to see if the comments are greedy or fearful.
Sentiment changes fast from my post not too long ago where I was also mocked for saying 230 in an AI bubble is unrealistic 

Recently I made a bold post,I claimed Nvidia would hit 230 by year end….

It’s possible but after today I’m disgusted by the price manipulation.

112,000,000 combined volume before a random thrust up? 

112,000,000/171,000,000 came from two huge bursts of volume. 

This changed my outlook and perception on Nvidia to the downside. If the company is mismanaging and manipulating the stock price to this degree I can’t say I want any part of this.

I looked into the so deal… OpenAI only generates 12B in revenue yet received 100billion? This just seems insane considering OpenAI burned 8billion this year and they’re not profitable but competing against google,tesla,meta that are very profitable especially in free cash flow. At least pets.com didn’t lose insane amounts of money each year.

So Nvidia, why did you invest 100billion in them? Where did these 112,000,000 volumes come from. Now that some random company with 224billion suddenly bought….super interesting 

I’m out of this stock, it’s too risky if it
‘s the case they need outside deals from ‘investors’ to keep a stock moving the way they’d like it to move 

Nvidia is the Enron of today and if you know that history it’s not good. 

One single miss on earnings in this stock that’s priced for perfection is insanely risky 

We usually also get 2 pullbacks in a year, I wonder what the excuse to rug pull will be from wall street

312,NVDA,DD: why i am all in BITF,"Bitcoin Mining to Gov-Grade AI Cloud?

1. Board Appointment Signals a Pivot

On Aug 18, 2025, Bitfarms appointed Wayne Duso (ex-AWS &amp; Dell) to its Board.

Why this matters: Duso helped scale AWS GovCloud and Dell’s $B+ businesses. His expertise is hyperscale cloud + government compliance (FedRAMP, FISMA, DoD IL5/IL6).

Speculation: Bitfarms may be lining up federal certifications for its Panther Creek (PA) site. These are must-have for handling sensitive workloads like defense AI model training.

Quick primer:

FedRAMP High → secure federal cloud for sensitive but unclassified data.

FISMA High → compliance for “severe consequence” data breaches.

DoD IL5/IL6 → Controlled Unclassified Info (IL5) and Secret (IL6) – critical for DoD AI workloads.

Add Duso’s background → very plausible Bitfarms is positioning Panther Creek for Gov/DoD AI contracts (think AWS-style premium pricing).

2. Revenue Potential – AI Cloud vs. Mining

Industry benchmarks (2025):

AI Data Centers: ~$12.5M/MW gross → ~$5–7M/MW net in PA.

Colocation: ~$1.3–1.5M/MW (TeraWulf).

CoreWeave (PA): ~$6M/MW.

Texas &amp; NY AI Cloud: $4–6M/MW (more volatility + higher energy costs).

Panther Creek specifics:

1 GW potential → scale to 500+ MW.

Nuclear + hydro power at $0.02–0.03/kWh via PJM grid (super cheap).

80% NOI margins if certified + locked with a hyperscaler (Amazon, etc.).

At $5–7M/MW, Panther Creek could generate $2.5–3.5B/year net if 500 MW is deployed.

3. Quebec Pilot – AMD MI300X Advantage

Early 2025, Bitfarms repurposed part of its Saint-Hyacinthe (QC) site (~50 MW) for AMD MI300X racks:

Memory Edge: 192 GB HBM3 vs. H100’s 80 GB → fewer GPUs needed for large models.

Cost: $15–20K vs. $30K+ H100 → ~20–30% lower TCO.

Efficiency: 750W TDP; Quebec pilot hit 85% GPU utilization on vLLM inference.

Software: ROCm 6.0+ now supports PyTorch + Hugging Face.

If scaled at Panther Creek:

Revenue boost → $6–8M/MW (thanks to AMD’s pricing + cheap power).

Quebec tests already yield 2–3x mining margins.

4. Talent &amp; Partners Lining Up

James Bond (yes, real name) hired as SVP of HPC on Mar 26, 2025 → likely behind the Quebec AI pilot.

T5 Data Centers provides lifecycle ops, certifications, and multi-year contracts → exactly the type of partner hyperscalers demand.

Locations = edge:

Pennsylvania: Cheap/stable nuclear, undersea fiber routes to EU/Africa, political support for data centers.

Washington: Hydro &lt; $0.03/kWh, West Coast hub with fiber routes to Asia.

5. The Big Picture

Bitfarms is quietly building an AWS-style AI/GovCloud pivot → with nuclear-backed capacity, AMD MI300X pilots, and GovCloud talent.

If certifications + hyperscaler deal land (Amazon is the obvious candidate), Panther Creek could turn into one of the highest-margin AI data centers in North America.

Bitcoin mining may become the “side hustle”; AI cloud could be the real money printer.


TLDR:

Wayne Duso (ex-AWS GovCloud) joins Bitfarms → signaling FedRAMP/DoD ambitions.

Panther Creek (PA) could net $5–7M/MW/year, scaling to multi-B revenue.

62,NVDA,WeRide (WRD) - Bet on Robotaxis - DD,"If you are looking to invest in a pure-play robotaxi/autonomous driving tech stock with blockbuster revenue growth and major global partnerships, you should seriously consider going all in on WRD. The recent quarter’s results and newsflow have been very positive: 

WRD tripled its Abu Dhabi robotaxi fleet, launched Saudi’s first service, secured permits in Dubai, Singapore, Belgium, and even made Fortune’s Change-the-World list. Some key facts:

# Let's see the recent Analyst sentiments:

* Citigroup (Sep 29, 2025): Initiated WRD coverage with a **Buy** rating and $15.50 price target.
* UBS (Aug 4, 2025): Initiated coverage with a **Buy** and $12.00 target.
* JPM: Initiated coverage orginally at \~$23 earlier this year but move it down to about 13 (still 30% upside from today
* s price)
* Consensus: Average 12-month price target \~$16.32, implying \~88% upside over current levels.

# Recent Earnings &amp; Growth (Q2 2025)

* Revenue: RMB127.2M (US$17.8M) in Q2’25, **+60.8% YoY**.
* Robotaxi revenue: RMB45.9M (US$6.4M), **+837% YoY**, now **36.1% of total revenue**.
* Gross Profit: RMB35.7M (US$5.0M), **+40.6% YoY**, with gross margin **28.1%**.
* R&amp;D/OpEx: Rapidly expanding (Q2 op-exp +42.5% to RMB487.8M) as WeRide scales globally.
* Net loss: RMB406.4M; management views spend as investment in future profitability.
* CEO/CFO: Emphasized robotaxi growth is now *core* to revenues; operations scaling globally is “at an inflection point” toward profitability.

# Robotaxi &amp; AV Partnerships (Tech Exposure)

WeRide’s whole thesis is scaling Level-4 autonomous taxis/shuttles worldwide, with major partnerships and pilots on 4 continents:

* **Middle East (Abu Dhabi, Riyadh, Dubai)**: Largest public AV fleets outside the US/China. Tripled Abu Dhabi fleet, first Saudi L4 taxi permit, rides linked with Uber. Middle East fleet aims for 1,000 vehicles by 2030.
* **China (Shanghai)**: Launched L4 robotaxis with Chery Group and Jinjiang taxi firm; co-developed new EV “CER” model.
* **Southeast Asia (Singapore)**: Grab invested in WeRide; first fully driverless robotaxi service planned with thousands of AVs in SEA.
* **Europe (France, Belgium)**: Partnered with Renault for L4 robo-shuttles, pilot programs in Belgium and France.
* **Tech**: HPC 3.0 computing unit cuts AV compute cost \~50%, giving WeRide an edge.
* **Permits**: Holds L4 AV licenses in 7 markets (China, UAE, Singapore, France, Saudi, Belgium, US), more than any peer.

# Key Metrics &amp; Valuation

* Market Cap: \~$2.9B.
* FY2024 Revenue: \~$50.2M; 2Q’25 alone $17.8M.
* Ownership: Founders hold \~4.8% each; corporate backers include SoftBank/Alliance Ventures and Zhengzhou Yutong. Top 25 holders own \~44%.
* Profitability: Unprofitable (2Q’25 net loss \~RMB406M), EPS deeply negative. Cash burn focused on R&amp;D and expansion.
* Guidance: Ambition to scale to “thousands” of robo-vehicles by 2026.
* Analyst Outlook: Average 12-month price target \~$16.3, reflecting strong confidence in growth.

# Recent News &amp; Catalysts

* **Belgium L4 Permit**: First-ever Belgian Level-4 test license for EZ10 Robobus in Leuven.
* **Dubai License**: Robotaxi trial permit; initial 50 GXR robotaxis, scaling to \~1,000 vehicles.
* **Grab Investment**: Strategic equity investment; L4 robotaxis to deploy across Southeast Asia.
* **Index &amp; PR Wins**: Added to Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index; featured on Fortune’s 2025 Change the World list.
* **Saudi Launch**: First public robotaxi pilot in Riyadh with Uber.

**What to watch next:**

* Revenue growth in Robotaxi business.
* New regulatory permits
* Partnerships with the big guys (Uber, NVDA)
* Buybacks

**Bottom line:** While there are valuation concerns due to high multiples, WeRide is unprofitable **but** growing explosively. The Q2 beat, positive analyst coverage, and pipeline of high-profile deployments make a bullish thesis. With a \~$2.9B market cap and small revenue base, the unique global footprint – 30+ cities, dozens of AV permits, and strong industry backing, I see massive growth potential. Catalysts like EU/ME rollouts, index inclusion, and continued robotaxi scaling could drive the stock if execution stays on track.",18,7,1759161917.0,2025-09-29T16:05:17+00:00,t3_1ntm28y,stocks

313,NVDA,YOLOing 50k into The $HI Acquisition Play,"Alright you fellow degenerates and gamblers, gather round. Forget Nvidia AI GPUs for a sec, I found the ultimate boomer stock with the most WSB energy imaginable: **Hillenbrand ($HI)**. Yeah, I know, sounds like a law firm or a casket company. Spoiler: it *was* a casket company. Now it makes boring plastic machines for Nestle and General Mills. Yup, exciting stuff.

So why should you care? Because some **private equity giga-chads (Apollo, Lone Star, Stellex)** are sniffing around like wolves at a nursing home buffet.

Here’s the kicker:

* EBITDA = \~$418M
* Normal boring industrial buyouts go for \~9–10× EBITDA
* Do the math: that’s a buyout price of \~$3.7–$4.0B EV → translates to about **$33–$36 per share**.
* Stock is sitting at $26.6. Bruh.

Now the fun part. Some **smart money lad yeeted $1.5M+ into $HI $30 calls expiring in November** right before close on Friday.

So we’ve got:

* Real buyers (Apollo don’t mess around).
* Real EBITDA math saying $33–36/share is the sweet spot.
* A PE bidding war.
* A random whale throwing $1.5M into illiquid calls like it’s a DraftKings parlay.

My dumb brain translation: either this dies in a ditch and we all lose money, or we get the juiciest $7–10/share tendie pop when a deal hits. My guess? **70% chance this goes through, 30% chance we’re bagholders crying into our Costco caskets**

So obivously, I YOLO'ed 50k into it. If you want exposure to *actual* smart money degeneracy instead of lotto scratchers on SPY weeklies, $HI might be the boomer rocket you never expected.

Based on my analysis target price: **$33–36**.  
Expiration date: **hopefully before our (at least mine) contracts do.**

TL;DR This company was killing it before tariff, still making a lot of things, all in the US of A. There's a bidding war and company will be acquired, I expect 7-8x EBITDA, so based on some sophisticated advanced complicated math, I think stocks will be at least $33 once it's announced or goes through.

63,NVDA,Wash Sales are Confusing,"Wash sales are a conundrum.
Wash sales are an oxymoron.
Wash sales are a black hole.
Wash sales are damnable. 

Let me explain. I’m considered the pattern day trader by my broker, interactive brokers. I am not one of those day traders that has five screens constantly trading five stocks at a time. I am a day trader that quite often just trade off my cell phone and I usually concentrate on one stock. Most recently it has been NVDA. I can assure you I’m not getting rich, there is no yacht in my future. I have no problem selling the stock for a total of five dollars profit. My goal is not to get rich,  just to give me something to do since I’ve retired. I recently ran across something that I have never seen nor did I know it was occurring. And that is an aspect of wash sales that I did not know was happening. Believe me when I tell you I understand wash sales since Scott trade shut down my trading for three days one time.

I have recently started trading a new stock and in seven days and over 50 trades I only had one loss- that  of a single  dollar. I have made a little  money off this stock. So I was surprised when interactive brokers raised my average price per share on a subsequent purchase  since I have incurred so little losses (a total of -$1 over 50 trades).

For those of you, like me who thought wash sale (or losses) were based on the total trade and not each individual trade you are wrong. It is enlightening. Let’s look at an example. 

The ABC corporation pays a good dividend and the stock price is pretty much range bound at $90 a share. But a rumor has surfaced that the ABC corporation will win a big contract and the share price goes up to $100 a share, you thinking if it’s true it will go higher so you buy one share at $100. Turns out the rumor is false and the share price drops to $80 a share. You knowing it is a $90 share company buy one share at $80. You now hold two shares with an average price of $90 a share. You sell your two shares at $91 per share and pocket two dollars. The price then drops to $70 a share. You realize this is just an over reaction to the loss of a potential contract and you buy one share at $70. But interactive brokers will reflect your average price per that one share at not $70 but at $79.  Because what I didn’t know was when I sold it at $91, I incurred a wash sale from where I purchased it from $100 and sold it at $91. I always thought the wash sale was based on the total sale and not each individual purchase. So when I sell my one share at $90 that I purchased at $70 interactive brokers will reflect a profit of $11 ($90-$79). But this is a mirage.  It is an illusion. If you go check your realized gains interactive brokers will reflect a profit of $11. YOUR COMPUTER SCREEN WILL ALSO REFLECT A PROFIT OF $11. This is for tax purposes only. If you go look at your cash report, according to interactive brokers, it will reflect a gain of $20. So those of you who are basing their profits off of a realized gain report it is not a true reflection of your actual trading.",0,18,1759065420.0,2025-09-28T13:17:00+00:00,t3_1nso3q8,stocks
365,NVDA,"U.S. equity valuations hit record highs, a risk signal?","As of August 2025, U.S. stock market valuation metrics (P/E ratio, CAPE, P/B ratio, P/S ratio, market cap-to-GDP, etc.) have reached their highest historical percentile. Historically, peaks in 1929, 1965, 1999, and 2021 were all followed by significant market volatility or corrections.

While the S&amp;P 500 has maintained a long-term upward trend, extremely high valuations often imply a risk of lower future returns.

Investors should be cautious of heightened volatility in an overvalued environment and diversify portfolios appropriately to hedge against potential downside risks.

77,NVDA,Should We Keep Accumulating Nvidia or Start Diversifying?,"Nvidia has been one of the most talked about stocks of the decade, riding the explosive growth of artificial intelligence and data-center demand. 

Over the past few years, the company has transformed itself from a gaming GPU maker into the global leader of AI infrastructure. But with the stock already up several hundred percent and the global semiconductor environment becoming more complicated, investors are starting to wonder whether it still makes sense to keep buying or if it’s time to spread bets across other AI-related names.

On the bearish side, there are a few major concerns that are hard to ignore.
First, critics continue to warn that artificial intelligence could turn out to be another speculative bubble. where expectations for world-changing technology ran ahead of real economic returns. 

If AI spending slows, or if the expected “AI revolution” takes longer to translate into broad profits, Nvidia’s rich valuation could quickly look stretched. Though markets and news folks are saying that AI is the new industrial revolution and riding on the AI bet is the new oil in the current market.

Second, geopolitics are creating real headwinds. China, one of the largest markets for high-performance computing, has begun restricting its companies from buying certain Nvidia chips in response to U.S. export controls. At the same time, the U.S. government is tightening its own rules and taking a 15% fee on certain advanced chips sold to China. These restrictions limit Nvidia’s ability to sell its most profitable products in a massive growth market and could cap near-term revenue growth. Any escalation in U.S. China tensions would only increase this risk.

Despite these challenges, the bullish case remains compelling.
Nvidia recently committed an eye-popping $100 billion investment in OpenAI, deepening its partnership with one of the key drivers of generative AI. Its GPUs remain in extraordinary demand, with hyperscale cloud providers, research labs, and AI start-ups scrambling to secure every unit they can get. Industry checks continue to show severe shortages of the latest H100 and upcoming Blackwell chips, allowing Nvidia to command premium pricing and maintain very high margins.

Management has also guided for another record quarter, with Q3 2024 forecasts ex China that is  expected to exceed Wall Street estimates, indicating that the AI spending still so much alive and we will see that it is still accelerating. On the other side we see that, Nvidia has been strategically investing in other technology players including a stake in Intel showing that the company is not resting on its current GPU dominance but is thinking ahead about future opportunities in compute, networking, and manufacturing.

Given these mixed signals, I feel quiet confused on making tough decision and I am sure most of you are as well.

Should you keep accumulating Nvidia on dips and ride the AI trend, Or does it make sense to diversify within the AI ecosystem, spreading capital across other chipmakers and software beneficiaries?

Potential alternatives include AMD, which is closing the gap with its MI300 accelerators; Broadcom, a key supplier of networking chips used in AI data centers; Oracle, which is leveraging AI to drive cloud adoption; Qualcomm, bringing AI capabilities to edge devices; and ASML, the critical lithography equipment provider that benefits no matter which chip designer wins.

Obviously the decision depends on our risk tolerance factor and time horizon. Nvidia remains the purest play on AI infrastructure and could continue to dominate for years if the AI boom lives up to expectations. But its success is now well known and well priced, but I feel relying on a single company is a kind of risk.

What’s your view keep buying Nvidia, hold what you have, or start spreading the bets before we miss any other growth stocks....??",0,13,1759037860.0,2025-09-28T05:37:40+00:00,t3_1nsgea2,StockMarket

Why It Matters
	•	Nvidia tapped NVTS for 800V AI power infrastructure
	•	Xiaomi chose NVTS GaN for its latest fast chargers
	•	Scaling to 200 mm GaN wafers with PSMC = lower cost + higher output

Numbers (Q1 2025)
	•	Revenue: $14M
	•	Cash: $75M to fund growth
	•	$25M losses now (cost of scaling)

The Bull Thesis
	•	TAM for GaN + SiC = tens of billions in AI, EVs, and clean energy
	•	Nvidia partnership could be the start of massive data center adoption
	•	EV makers are moving to SiC at scale — NVTS is positioned to ride that wave
	•	Institutions are quietly adding, betting on long-term upside

NVTS is not just another chip stock — it’s a category leader in the making. If they keep executing, this could be one of the biggest power semiconductor growth stories of the decade.

315,NVDA,Single Cell Analyst couldn't be more wrong about INTEL and AI,"# Single Cell Analysts and Investors are fucking wrong, and NVIDIA interest in INTEL proves it

AI runs on GPUs, right? RIGHT?

The answer is it depends. And most people (including developers) don't know that, but they will know, eventually

Let's begin with memory bandwidth from now on BW

Each token generation requires accessing ALL model weights, that means for each output token you need to load the entire model so how fast you load that model in memory, for that bw was the major limitation of CPUs ultill the next gen

The current top xeon has 0.614TB/s which is a ton, and could be working on dual configuration with 6TB RAM at 1,7TB/s but Top GPUs like A100 have 2TB/s and H100 has 3TB/s, the next generation of Intel Xeon 18A is expected to have \~2TB/s. Positioning near A100.

BW tl;dr: \*\*Usually doubling bandwidth roughly doubles token generation speed  
BW deepdive:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1brcnps/is\_inferencing\_memory\_bandwidth\_limited/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1brcnps/is_inferencing_memory_bandwidth_limited/)



Let's keep going, usually big chunk papa models cannot and will not work on a CPU period, but advances in quantization(from now on Q\_) made possible to run big papa models like gpt-oss 120b run on a CPU with a loss in accuracy near to 2%

Usually models are based on 16B and Q\_ down to 8 or 4, each time you half the number of bits, it halves the model size. For example GPT-OSS could run Q\_8 with only 60GB what makes possible to run at any modern workstation CPU RAM. You have 2 modules of 32GB DDR5? Boom you can run Q\_ big papa models

Q\_ tl;dr: CPUs can run big models on RAM now

Q\_ deepdive: [https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/optimizing-llms-for-performance-and-accuracy-with-post-training-quantization/](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/optimizing-llms-for-performance-and-accuracy-with-post-training-quantization/)

Let's talk about money, while a GPU is the king and surpasses the CPU in every metric possible, CPUs are crazy energy efficient and versatile, but what does it mean? It means that server providers are more prone to buy a CPU because they have a wider set of applications, and not only inference so they can have less idle time and more money back from their chips, since we discussed earlier, not everyone needs the biggest model available and token generation speed in new Xeon processors with CPU tokens per second sucks vs GPU they are not even close, but! Look at performance:

[https:\/\/www.nscale.com\/blog\/cpu-inferencing-why-not](https://preview.redd.it/8h79t8kqjcrf1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e3f3f23a5491adf4064be81e5af3be9a53dd86c)

Oh boy, you can bet small to mid-sized businesses are going to notice this, since this graph is not suitable for large environments where inference is handled by a cluster using vLLM or other software that allows load distribution and pipeline parallelism.

And they are not only crazy efficient but Intel is positioning at the most competitive chips for LLM inference per dollar:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1jxwk05/intel\_6944p\_the\_most\_cost\_effective\_cpu\_solution/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1jxwk05/intel_6944p_the_most_cost_effective_cpu_solution/)

Lastly, the necessity of private LLM execution for small and mid-sized businesses is a niche that perfectly meets CPU inference.

[https://openmetal.io/resources/blog/private-ai-cpu-vs-gpu-inference/](https://openmetal.io/resources/blog/private-ai-cpu-vs-gpu-inference/)

On top of all of this, Intel and NVIDIA reached an agreement which announcement literally says: ""For data centers, Intel will build NVIDIA-custom x86 CPUs that NVIDIA will integrate into its AI infrastructure platforms and offer to the market.""  
[https://newsroom.intel.com/artificial-intelligence/intel-and-nvidia-to-jointly-develop-ai-infrastructure-and-personal-computing-products](https://newsroom.intel.com/artificial-intelligence/intel-and-nvidia-to-jointly-develop-ai-infrastructure-and-personal-computing-products)  
So you can bet every board in a data center that works with Nvidia will have an Intel-manufactured CPU, which means that NVIDIA could be one of the first clients of the new Foundries that could be followed by other manufacturers and fabless chip designers.

tl;dr: buy intel

1. **New partnership initiatives** aimed at integrating their platform into broader financial/data networks.
2. **ADIO product** is tapping into the growing audio/data management market.
3. **AI tailwinds** — DVLT’s narrative is directly aligned with the hottest investing theme today.

# 📊 Market Cap Potential

* If DVLT hits $50M revenue by 2026 and gets even a 5× sales multiple → $250M valuation.
* A 10× multiple would imply $500M+.
* From today’s sub-$100M cap, that’s a potential **3–6× move** if execution lands.

# ⚠️ Risks

* Early-stage company — execution risk is huge.
* Financing/dilution could be needed to fund growth.
* Competition in AI/data is fierce — must carve a niche.

# ✅ Why I’m Positive

* **Asymmetry**: Don’t need perfection — just one or two wins.
* **Narrative strength**: AI + data monetization is an easy story for investors to grab onto.
* **Undervalued size**: Sub-$100M market cap gives plenty of room for rerating if traction builds.

# 🎯 My Call

DVLT is a classic microcap moonshot:

* Risky? Sure.
* Potential for multiple expansion? Absolutely.
* Positioned in two megatrends (AI + data management)? Yes.

If they keep building partnerships and hitting their targets, the upside from here could be significant.",9,5,1758775877.0,2025-09-25T04:51:17+00:00,t3_1npxvoz,SmallStreetBets
345,NVDA,"Nvidia Stock, poised to surpass 230 by year end","Nvidia stock is very misunderstood. Many have been shorting at 180’s and buying at 170’s. It’s been doing this since July 28th. Consolidating for nearly two months.

Nvidia’s key points 

1. They’re not lying about demand. I haven’t heard anyone comment about China not being relevant to their success…the reason Nvidia isn’t concerned is simply because demand surpasses supply even without China.

2. Nvidia has been talking with intel behind the scenes for about a year confirmed by Jensen. If we read in between the lines it means they’ve likely already sucessfully merged a product with intel. Nvidia should never be underestimated with the resources they have at their disposal. Another market Nvidia will dominate and quickly take shares of.

3. Nvidia is an early investor in many of the upcoming giants of tomorrow like NBIS and CoreWeave. All those gains are net positives for Nvidia and only contribute to continued growth. NBIS for example has the most significant growth rates I’ve ever seen a company produce. 820percent revenue before Microsoft deal? That’s execution.

4. OpenAI isn’t a public company,Nvidia is now getting a slice of the most desired AI  company that’s still operating privately. People don’t understand that now Nvidia will have access to all the data OpenAI has…

I could just go on for paragraphs about all the deals Nvidia is doing, about the acceleration of new products but one thing we forgot to mention is Nvidia Hasn’t Moved in Stock price despite having a forward PE of 31…..while the s@p average is currently 27. Why is that you ask? Because currently the market couldn’t give a sht about value.The needle won’t explode with a stock valued at 4.35trillion like oracle or Crypto. 

Nvidia is an exceptional company that’s constantly preformed,evolved and is without a doubt the centre of AI and even still insane growth potential. 

Stocks spend months in consolidation period Nvidia has definitely been doing that, simply a no brainer buy. 

It’s an Undervalued stock considering it’s crop dusting any other of the mag 7. 

I am an Nvidia Investor and I’ve added more today at 176.20 as I believe we’ll see a big rotation in Nvidia and several other chip stocks, I’ve averaged up from 91 to a current of 120 because I see this as a great opportunity for solid gains.

The moment 185 breaks is the moment I could see this hitting 210.

102,NVDA,NVTS Navitas Semiconductor Run Incoming (NVDA Blackwell),"I’m picking NVTS for AI and Data Center Expansion. Basically this is a company specializing in next-generation power semiconductors, including gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC) technologies. These are used in high-growth areas like AI data centers, electric vehicles (EVs), mobile charging, and renewable energy.

•  NVTS eyeing revival through NVIDIA AI synergies—volume’s solid, but P/E flags caution. Buybacks could turbocharge if fundamentals align; divested $100M+ last year signals pivot potential.

•  Risk-reward tightening.. Upside from scale-ups and partnerships; downside on costs/delays.

•  Pre-market buzz tied to EV/AI tailwinds—partnership expansions and earnings guidance in focus.

•  Shares breaking 50-day MA on volume—technical setup for extension if momentum holds.

•  Despite revenue dip, EV/semi growth narrative intact—optimism hinges on delivery.

Not financial advice, DYOR, but if AI infrastructure bottlenecks persist (hello, NVIDIA Blackwell), NVTS could be the under-the-radar winner. At the current price, I’d say the room to run is to $16 after $9 breaks. We saw this on APLD. This narrative is the play.

Q3 earnings Nov 3 could spotlight AI progress; ECCE and WiPDA conferences in Oct/Nov for tech showcases; CES 2026 prep might drop EV bombshells via VREMT.

\[FINAL UPDATE: Sold out for \~5% profit after 8 days\]

Options were kinda expensive on this one so I didn't think they were underpriced. Being said - lots of shit / potential catalysts around this one that I am unsure if market has priced in yet. Look at all NVDA's recent partnerships (OpenAI in particular - I'm looking at you). I believe micron provides the memory for nvidia GPU's and it may have potential to go brr. Dunno - it's an ER play. I actually don't really know what these guys do to be honest, just lots of chatter &amp; I blindly trusted chat. I'm likely rotating out of micron within a week. These were bought this morning as I rotated out of $SNAP calls. I didn't like how options were priced on this one so monkeyed into shares instead.

It's already ran 40% last month, so high risk. I love buying the top.

Goodluck to all in the cino

\[Update\] Literally flat. Boring. My call about options being overpriced was correct, these are up \~0.5% if AH holds tomorrow. Glad I bought shares &amp; didn't play options here. Theta gang printing tho. I'm up like 5-10k on the AH movement. Theta gang &amp; shares won this one.

\[Update 2\] Might make like 1.5-2% on these tomorrow. Seems to be trending upwards. Lots of people bullish in the other threads - suggesting a hold is an alright bet. My read about overpriced vol seems to be correct tho - options are not the play on this one. I'll update chat when I exit. Goodluck to all.

82,NVDA,Nvidia investment in a Big Red Flag,"Hi everyone, 

  
Everyone knows Nvidia invested in Open AI with 100 billions dollars. So, Open AI will get 100 billions dollars to buy Nvidia chipset for their data centers.  

If you got some knowledge about stockmarket history, this investment is typical what Cisco did with some client like ICG Communications.  
  
In the fact, Open AI is losing money and are not expecting to get money before 2028. So, Nvidia make an investment of 100 billion to allow them to buy the chipset. Yes, Nvidia makes a ""loan"" to his client because they don't have money. Cisco did the same

In AI business, lot of people make a big investment in data center because they've got money like Microsoft, Apple, Google, Amazon ... but Open AI doesn't have the money. 

And what happen to ""cisco capital"" ? lot of companies declared bankrupcy during the .com crisis because the expected yield had never come. And Cisco will never get back the money.

Nvidia is doing the same with Open AI. And maybe with Intel ...",593,116,1758643656.0,2025-09-23T16:07:36+00:00,t3_1noliog,StockMarket

I think $APLD deserves a proper DD. Stock has gone absolutely nuts this year and rightfully so.

# Price Action:

Back in April this thing was around $3.  
Fast forward to now and it’s sitting near $20. That’s not just meme momentum it’s tied to monster contracts and a legit buildout story.

Notable mention:

Q4 2025 earnings call the CEO Wes Cummins confirmed that the company is in ""advanced negotiations"" with a major North American hyperscaler. (So we can assume other big contracts will be announced soon?)

# The Big Contracts:

CoreWeave (which is also backed by NVIDIA just like APLD), one of the hottest AI infra names, signed two 15-year leases worth about $7B in revenue.  
Then they exercised another 150 MW lease, bringing their total with APLD to 400 MW and raising the backlog to roughly $11B.  
This is locked-in, multi-year recurring revenue once facilities go live.

# Roadmap / Buildout (as mentioned on their official site):

480+ MW constructed in the last 18 months shows they can scale fast.  
400 MW currently under construction at Polaris Forge 1 in Ellendale, ND. First 100 MW goes live in Q4 2025, another 150 MW mid-2026, final 150 MW in 2027.  
1.4+ GW future pipeline already scoped out, backed by financing from Macquarie.  
Super efficient designs, direct chip cooling in collab with DELL, ND climate, PUE +-1.18, keep costs low versus their competitors.

# Energy contracts:

Secured 200 MW renewable power in Texas via TerraForm Power (Brookfield) to supply their Garden City site.  
For Polaris Forge 2 in ND, they already locked in power through Cass County Electric and Minnkota Power.  
These deals mean cheap, reliable energy the lifeblood of AI/HPC data centers. Without it, the contracts wouldn’t even be possible.

**TL:DR**

$3 in April to +-$24 now.  
$11B+ lease backlog with CoreWeave.  
480 MW built, 400 MW under construction, 1.4 GW pipeline.  
Energy supply already secured in TX and ND.  
Backed by Macquarie financing and designed for efficiency.

Not financial advice. Just my DD.

“SPX essentially up 10x since the March ’09 Global Financial Crisis bottom at 666. It’s likely too cute for it to top at exactly 6,666, and we suspect the year finishes higher than that,” he wrote in a note dated Sunday. “Tactically, however, a consolidation makes sense into what is still an extremely weak seasonal stretch.”

Krinsky pointed to an adage on Wall Street known as “sell Rosh Hashanah, buy Yom Kippur,” a strategy that says investors should sell into the Jewish new year and buy after the day of atonement. This year’s period runs from Sept. 22 through Oct. 2.

348,NVDA,Do you think the stock market is in a euphoric stage right now? I'm slightly scared now..,"I’ve been following some recent data and commentary, and it looks like a lot of indicators are flashing “froth” or even outright euphoria. Like the openAI, oracle, nvidia deals. And the everything AI boom with no earnings to back it yet stocks keep going to the moon. It's crazy.

Retail traders are very active, margin debt is climbing, and there’s a lot of speculation.

On the flip side, earnings growth for big tech/AI names has been strong, and many argue this justifies higher multiples. Also, interest rate cut expectations seem to be fueling optimism.

So I’m curious:

349,NVDA,Long Term AI Strategy,"AI has been developing rapidly for the last few years and it's becoming clear that it is not going away anymore. Let's zoom out a bit. What is a good strategy to capitalize on a still very young industry with new players joining every day? I'm currently seeing three main segments that drive revenue with a TAM that's rapidly expanding across all three segments:

**Infrastructure**
Companies like Nvidia, AMD, Microsoft and Oracle are building chips and datacenters to generate compute. All of the MAG7 companies are investing heavily in their own facilities to become a big player in the scene without any sign of slowing down.

**Data**
The place the internet comes together is a goldmine for LLM's to be trained on. Places Like X (Twitter) (owned by xAI) GitHub (owned by Microsoft, very valuable for coding), Stack overflow, Wikipedia, Quora, but maybe the biggest and most valuable of them all, yes, Reddit. A very important aspect of why Reddit's conversations are very valuable is because there is no money incentive like on X. The company has gone public in 2024 and has done licensing deals with Google and OpenAI and others worth 200M+ annually. They are reportedly currently in talks with Google for a much bigger deal. The platform is imo mildly monetized and thus growing rapidly. A company worth looking into financially.

**Applications**
Probably the biggest and widest segment that has yet to fully materialize is the way AI has been putting itself on the market as a product. The most obvious applications are LLM's like ChatGPT, but OpenAI is not close to profitability. Self-Driving cars are also slowly being applied, but in low numbers. Public companies like Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Salesforce and Palantir are among a bigger group of companies well positioned to thrive in this segment.

AI is no longer just a buzzword. The companies that control infrastructure, data, or applications are setting the rules of the game. The next few years are going to separate the leaders from the followers. If you’re looking to understand where value is being created, AI is still a an early opportunity.",2,20,1758574276.0,2025-09-22T20:51:16+00:00,t3_1nny89w,stocks

86,NVDA,Thoughts on JCI,"Looking at where hyperscaler contracts might land (Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Google). Has anyone thought about JCI (Johnson Controls)?

Cooling is a big deal.

Data centres are running hotter than ever because of AI and higher density racks. NVIDIA just reported a partnership with OpenAI to build 10 gigawatts of AI data centres using NVIDIA chips. That’s a lot of energy and a lot of heat generated.

Old school air cooling ain’t cutting it. I see that JCI’s offering Silent Aire coolant distribution units that scale from half a megawatt to 10mw+. That’s tailor made for hyperscalers building AI farms. They’ve announced a long term partnership with Tabreed (a giant district cooling company in the Middle East) to push for next gen cooling. 

JCI’s reach is bigger than people realize too.

NA: their biggest unit is lead by Julie Brandt, who just got a special RSU retention package because the board doesn’t want her going anywhere. Instead she’ll be leading the biggest growth market until 2027.

EU: strong in chilled water, smart building retrofits, and compliance heavy ESG projects. Hyperscalers love this because EU regulators are strict on efficiency.

APAC: Silent Aire has hubs in China, Singapore, India, and Australia. They’re selling chillers for crazy hot climates. Again, perfect for AI data centers.

Bottom line.

JCI might not be as flashy as NVIDIA or AMD but someone has to keep those AI racks cool.

350,NVDA,Where does the massive Nvidia-OpenAI deal leave Microsoft?,"With the news that Nvidia is investing up to $100 billion into OpenAI, primarily for infrastructure, I'm trying to understand the strategic implications for Microsoft.

For years, Microsoft has been seen as OpenAI's exclusive partner, providing the Azure cloud infrastructure and integrating OpenAI's models deeply into its ecosystem. They had a deal for a huge chunk of OpenAI's profits and seemed to be in the driver's seat.

Now, Nvidia isn't just a supplier anymore; they're a massive strategic investor.

Does this mean Microsoft's influence is significantly reduced? Is their ""special relationship"" with OpenAI over? Are they now just one of two major partners, or does the Nvidia deal sideline them in the long run? It seems like OpenAI is diversifying its dependencies in a big way.

351,NVDA,Nvidia will Invest up to $100 Billion in OpenAI,"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/22/nvidia-openai-data-center.html


&gt;""Nvidia will invest $100 billion in OpenAI as the artificial intelligence lab sets out to build hundreds of billions of dollars in data centers based around Nvidia’s AI chips, the companies said on Monday.

&gt;OpenAI plans to operate Nvidia systems that require 10 gigawatts of power, the companies said on Monday. A gigawatt is a measure of power that is increasingly being used to describe the biggest clusters of AI chips.

&gt;The partnership highlights how linked OpenAI and Nvidia are as two of the biggest drivers of the recent artificial intelligence boom. Demand for Nvidia’s GPUs first started rising when OpenAI first released ChatGPT in 2022, and OpenAI still relies on Nvidia’s AI chips to develop its software and deploy it to users.

&gt;It also signals just how many Nvidia chips OpenAI will need in order to develop next-generation artificial intelligence that can do more than its current models.

&gt;“This is monumental in size,” CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC’s Jon Fortt in an interview on Monday.

&gt;“Compute infrastructure will be the basis for the economy of the future, and we will utilize what we’re building with NVIDIA to both create new AI breakthroughs and empower people and businesses with them at scale,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a statement.

&gt;In August, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told investors on an earnings call that building one gigawatt of data center capacity costs between $50 billion and $60 billion, of which about $35 billion of those costs are for Nvidia chips and systems.

&gt;Nvidia will join a roster of investors that valued OpenAI at $500 billion in a recent secondary round. Microsoft was one of OpenAI’s early investors, and has strategic partnership with it to integrate OpenAI models into its cloud service, Azure, and Microsoft Office.""









This is quite the circular economy we got going here. By investing in the deeply unprofitable startup that buys their product, they ensure demand for their products remains strong.

Probably the right move for Nvidia, because a lot of this money will come back to them, and they can sell their hardware at high Margins. And with their stock trading at 50x earnings, it makes sense to spend their cash flow on funding/acquiring AI startups rather than buying back shares.

This all but ensures the  AI bubble keeps going a couple more years, but also inflates it even further. MAG7 is becoming more and more exposed to AI, with cash flows going towards datacenter buildout and training AI models rather than innovation or shareholder returns.",592,168,1758557984.0,2025-09-22T16:19:44+00:00,t3_1nnqz79,stocks

320,NVDA,Huge Micron Bet,"Hey everyone,

First time with a DD so forgive me if I sound regarded. 

This is the biggest trade I am set up for and wanted to share my thoughts. 

I believe we are going to see a huge run up next Tuesday with Microns earnings call. Current price is $162 with the pull back with Samsungs announcement spooking the market but I believe this won’t affect Microns future capabilities with HBM.  

So Micron Q4 earnings are coming up… and I’m bullish. I took up a huge position with the underlying prior to the pump on Thursday. 

Yesterday with the drop I loaded up at the bottom on 200 calls $175 expiring October 17. 

My logic is this. 

Seeing what happened with Oracle over their guidance gives me confident we may expect something crazy from Micron, especially when their customers Nvidia, Amd, Microsoft, Amazon, Google all had record years. All of them just crushed it on AI and cloud growth.

If they’re winning, Micron is too. Every GPU and every data center relies on Micron’s memory to run. While there are 2 main competitors in the memory landscape (Samsung and SK Hynix) I believe Micron is well positioned regardless. 

Last quarter: $9.3B in revenue with nearly 50% growth in high-bandwidth memory sales.

Next up: Management is guiding ~$10.7B for Q4 with stronger margins. I think they may beat expectations. 

In all of the last 5 reported fiscal quarters listed above, Micron has beaten EPS expectations.  ￼

The beat amounts range from ~+$0.13 to ~+$0.34 in recent quarters.

The most recent (Q3 FY2025) was the largest beat in that sample, +$0.34

However with this upcoming Q4 FY 2025, EPS consensus estimates are around $2.78-$2.86 per share. Year-over-year that’s a big jump from ~$1.18 in Q4 FY2024.  ￼
	
Gross margin expectations have been revised up, reflecting tight supply + improved pricing (especially DRAM).

Analyst Quotes &amp; Price Targets

Wedbush (Matt Bryson) – PT $200

The firm believes current Street estimates remain too low given the structural tailwinds in AI-centric workloads.” 【PriceTargets.com】

JPMorgan (Harlan Sur) – PT $185

“JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur raised Micron’s price target to $185 from $160 and kept an Overweight rating. Sur highlighted upside to revenue, gross margin, and earnings in the near term, driven by better-than-expected pricing across multiple end-markets including AI data centers, smartphones, and personal computers. He said the company is likely to announce November-quarter guidance that comes in solidly ahead of consensus expectations. JPMorgan believes Micron’s HBM3E ramp and DRAM cost reductions are ahead of schedule, which will further support earnings acceleration.” 【Benzinga】

Rosenblatt Securities (Kevin Cassidy) – PT $200

“Rosenblatt Securities analyst Kevin Cassidy reaffirmed a Buy rating on Micron and boosted the firm’s target to $200. Cassidy wrote that Micron could report a modest beat to its preannounced results, but the real story will be the outlook. He expects Micron’s November-quarter guidance may come in much higher than consensus estimates of $11.8 billion in revenue and non-GAAP EPS of $3.00. Cassidy emphasized that constrained DRAM and NAND Flash wafer supply through at least 2026, alongside accelerating demand from AI workloads, positions Micron for outsized profitability.” 【Benzinga】

“With another quarter of shipment growth forecasted in fiscal Q4, we expect to exit fiscal 2025 with tight DRAM inventories, significantly reduced NAND inventories and overall company DIO near our target levels. With low inventories on hand and a constructive demand environment, we will continue to focus on improving pricing and further strengthening our product mix.” — Management.  ￼

TLDR

Best Case (Bullish)

Revenue: ~$11.2B+ (above top of guidance)

EPS: $2.90+ (beats revised $2.85 guide)

Gross Margin: 45%+ (tight supply + strong DRAM/HBM pricing)

Guidance: Raised again for FY2026, pointing to sustained AI/cloud demand
	
Stock Impact: Could rally +20–30%, pushing toward $180–$200 as analysts hike targets

Worst Case (Bearish)

Revenue: &lt; $11.0B (below guide midpoint)

EPS: &lt; $2.70 (miss vs Street ~$2.78–$2.85)

Margins: Slip toward 42–43% (pricing softness, higher costs)

Guidance: Conservative, signaling slower demand or inventory concerns

Stock Impact: Could drop −10–25%, retracing toward $120–$130

The biggest risk I see is the cyclical narrative but given the demand this year and how we are seeing AI and data centers scaling up, I think we have reached a point where the market transitions from cyclical to more secular. 

Right now PE is ~24-25 with the drop but if EPS expectation is hit $10-12 for FY 2026, and PE drops to 18-20 we are still looking at $200+ price target. I believe $175-185 is a lower range.

Of course this all depends on how Micron Management forward guidance looks but I think we are in for a surprise.

66,NVDA,Regarding Investing in Stocks - Scalping/Swings. How often to check companies financials?,"Investing in stocks, using company (valuations, financials, ownership, performance and technical) analysis.

How often should I be checking up on the overall performance of the stock? For example, Invested in a quantum stock 2 days ago, was already up 7% and sold for profit. I'm not afraid of taxes as long as I'm making profit and reinvesting in other companies that are moving fast.

Should I be checking them everyday, every week? I know trends move and money flows... I've been keeping tight numbers of whats doing good etc... I have long term investments and short term, but the short term is what I want to be watching.

Saw a post somewhere that said 15% profit on stocks are a good exit? Obviously doing this comes risk of missing a potential runner like (PLTR,NVDA) if I were to find that startup company early and selling for a short gain.

Any tips of this type of thing? Like if X company losses X value daily / weekly in a row exit position?",0,5,1758314983.0,2025-09-19T20:49:43+00:00,t3_1nlf2rd,stocks

352,NVDA,Where OpenAI's $300b deal with Oracle can come from,"I thought the $300b deal was BS when I first saw it. I now think it's real.

1. OpenAI will likely IPO. Right now, they're worth $500b in private valuation based on their last funding round. I'm willing to bet that they can IPO for $1 trillion in valuation today based on pure AI ecstasy and raise a cool $100b - $200b in cash.

2. The $300b deal starts in 2027 and runs 5 years. On average, it's $60b/year which is less than what other big AI players are spending now. Google is spending $75b in 2025. Amazon is spending $100b in 2025. Microsoft is spending $80b in 2025. Meta is spending $72b in 2025. The deal looks very reasonable from this perspective.

3. OpenAI's revenue nearly 4x'ed this year to $13b. Let's say they can 3x in 2026, that's 29b. Let's say they can 2x in 2027 (deal starts here), that's $58b. This is assuming slowing growth. I can also easily see accelerating growth for a few more years.

4. Deal with Oracle will likely be a ramp. Example: $30b in 2027. $60b in 2028. $100b in 2029. $150b in 2030. $160b in 2031. 5 years. It'll allow OpenAI to grow into it. Based on projected revenue, OpenAI will spend about ~50% of their 2027 revenue on payments to Oracle. 

Maybe everything will crash before this deal ever materializes. Maybe LLMs hit a dead end. Maybe you just hate everything AI. None of that matters. What matters is that OpenAI does have a decent chance of fulfilling the deal over a 5 year period starting in 2027 based on how things are going.

PS. Why Oracle? Because Oracle is the only cloud company that is NOT trying to compete against Nvidia so they're likely getting favors from Nvidia. Meta, Google, Microsoft, AWS, and even Apple are all designing and making their own internal AI chips. Nvidia likely wants to make Oracle its main partner going forward.

tldr; OpenAI IPO can easily raise $100b+, revenue growth projections can cover Oracle payments, it's less per year than what Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta are already paying in datacenter capex in 2025.",113,59,1758282652.0,2025-09-19T11:50:52+00:00,t3_1nl1f0l,stocks

116,NVDA,HUGE Deal Between $INTC and $NVDA,"NVIDIA and Intel announced a multi-generation collaboration across PC and datacenter and NVIDIA will invest $5B in Intel at $23.28 per share. The joint solution will be a tight coupling Intel x86 CPUs and NVIDIA RTX GPUs over NVLink for PCs and data-center platforms. Timeframe are TBD and current roadmaps with arm will not change, per sources, meaning NVIDIA will offer both.
 
Overall
 
•PCs: Intel will build and sell x86 SoCs integrating NVIDIA RTX GPU chiplets
•Data center: Intel will build NVIDIA-custom x86 CPUs that NVIDIA integrates into its AI platforms
•Financial: NVIDIA is committing $5B to Intel equity at $23.28/share
•Scope: Product collaboration—not a foundry manufacturing deal
 
Why it matters
 
•Windows/x86 PCs: Higher-bandwidth, lower-latency CPU-GPU coupling should lift AI inference and pro-app and gaming performance versus discrete PCIe designs. Data center: NVIDIA gains an x86 option alongside ARM; Intel attaches CPUs into NVIDIA’s fastest-growing AI platforms.
 
What we don’t know yet
 
•Ship timing, ramp cadence, and how many generations.
•NVLink specifics (bandwidth, flavor, coherence) and CPU-DRAM/GPU-HBM memory topology.
•Process nodes and packaging (EMIB/Foveros) for the PC SoC and the custom DC CPU.
•PC SoC scope (NPU, power targets, die/chiplet counts) and NVIDIA rack-level designs.
•Software stack details (CUDA/driver model on Windows/x86; Linux support).
•Commercial mechanics of RTX chiplets inside an Intel-sold SoC and CPU attach accounting on NVIDIA platforms",1365,205,1758193818.0,2025-09-18T11:10:18+00:00,t3_1nk5cl8,wallstreetbets

355,NVDA,$APLD DD AI Datacenters huge run from $3 --&gt; $20 since April,"I think $APLD  deserves a proper DD. Stock has gone absolutely nuts this year and rightfully so.

# Price Action:

Back in April this thing was around $3.  
Fast forward to now and it’s sitting near $20. That’s not just meme momentum it’s tied to monster contracts and a legit buildout story. 

Notable mention:

Q4 2025 earnings call the CEO Wes Cummins confirmed that the company is in ""advanced negotiations"" with a major North American hyperscaler. (So we can assume other big contracts will be announced soon?)

# The Big Contracts:

CoreWeave (which is also backed by NVIDIA just like APLD), one of the hottest AI infra names, signed two 15-year leases worth about $7B in revenue.  
Then they exercised another 150 MW lease, bringing their total with APLD to 400 MW and raising the backlog to roughly $11B.  
This is locked-in, multi-year recurring revenue once facilities go live.

# Roadmap / Buildout (as mentioned on their official site):

480+ MW constructed in the last 18 months shows they can scale fast.  
400 MW currently under construction at Polaris Forge 1 in Ellendale, ND. First 100 MW goes live in Q4 2025, another 150 MW mid-2026, final 150 MW in 2027.  
1.4+ GW future pipeline already scoped out, backed by financing from Macquarie.  
Super efficient designs, direct chip cooling in collab with DELL, ND climate, PUE +-1.18, keep costs low versus their competitors.

# Energy contracts:

Secured 200 MW renewable power in Texas via TerraForm Power (Brookfield) to supply their Garden City site.  
For Polaris Forge 2 in ND, they already locked in power through Cass County Electric and Minnkota Power.  
These deals mean cheap, reliable energy the lifeblood of AI/HPC data centers. Without it, the contracts wouldn’t even be possible.

**TL:DR**

$3 in April to +-$20 now.  
$11B+ lease backlog with CoreWeave.  
480 MW built, 400 MW under construction, 1.4 GW pipeline.  
Energy supply already secured in TX and ND.  
Backed by Macquarie financing and designed for efficiency.

381,NVDA,Powell’s hawkish tone sparks retail optimism,"Today, Powell’s speech was actually hawkish, dispelling market expectations of rapid rate cuts, leading to a brief sharp drop in U.S. stocks. After the speech ended, a large number of retail investors continued to pour in, possibly believing “this time is different,” and remained relatively optimistic. The global stock market “sell signal” has been triggered for the third consecutive month. In September, the proportion of institutional investors’ cash to assets reached 3.9%.

The economic growth chart shows a drop from last year’s 2.5% directly to 1.5%, with consumption slowing. The job market looks even less optimistic. The unemployment rate has climbed to 4.3%.

In August, the ISM Manufacturing PMI fell to 48.7, contracting for the 6th consecutive month. Over the past 34 months, this sector has declined in 32 months.

A sharp downturn is coming soon. I always predict 2–3 months in advance: from the crash in March this year, to the big rebound in May, and now another sharp crash expected around the end of the year. Of course, I am sometimes wrong, but not often.

382,NVDA,"“There are no risk-free paths now. It’s not incredibly obvious what to do,” Powell said.","What’s more, the central bank gave a hawkish outlook for rates in 2026, where officials are predicting only one more rate cut in the new year, slower than the current market pricing of two-to-three. To be sure, the Fed’s so-called dot plot shows a large variance of opinion for the next year.

“Net, net, Fed officials did not hit the panic button as they chose to cut rates by the smallest possible magnitude at the September meeting,” said Christopher S. Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS. “The one rate cut per meeting pace shows they no longer feel tariff-based inflation is a serious threat and that the economic growth slowdown with companies onboarding fewer new employees is increasingly the bigger risk. Stagflation is out and labor market concerns are moved to the front-burner.”

357,NVDA,Uranium/Nuclear Equities irrationally sinking due to China 'ban' on NVIDIA's AI chips. The reality is uranium is in seriously short supply.,"Obviously this ban (actually the Chinese government telling Chinese companies to avoid NVIDIA's AI chips) is bringing down NVIDIA stocks today. But it looks like it is also affecting Uranium and Nuclear. Sprott and VanEck Uranium/Nuclear ETFs are down up to a half percent as I type this, for example. However, this ""instruction"" by the Chinese government *does not affect the building boom of data centres in the western world*. These data centres are still being built at a record pace in America and elsewhere.

Consider first that it is recognized that there is impending uranium shortage because of this data centre building boom and widely predicted energy shortage. There is simply not enough uranium being mined and processed today to keep up with a very real future demand.

And on top of this, there is a growing understanding that a more reliable and 'green' source of stable power is required for the next 50 years or so, until 'renewable' energy can do this. Currently green can definitely supply large amounts of power, but the stability at grid scale is still a work in progress.

Nuclear is in such high demand, that even retired nuclear generating stations are being refurbished and brought back online. And at least 5 countries in Europe are either extending the lives of current reactors, and/or are also building new ones.

Even Canada is upping its nuclear game. A sure sign that nuclear is winning, over purely wind and solar solutions. It is expanding its nuclear capacity. The Bruce Generating Station in Ontario has almost completed adding two new reactors, which will make it once again the largest nuclear generating station in the world. And Ontario's Darlington nuclear generating station (currently with 4 reactors) will be adding 4 new SMRs which was just announced by the PM. And Alberta is looking seriously at building a nuclear generating station. If Canada is doing this, nuclear is mainstream.

My crystal ball says uranium and nuclear will be in big demand for some time to come.",32,35,1758121728.0,2025-09-17T15:08:48+00:00,t3_1njfr5i,stocks
358,NVDA,A deep dive into the autonomous robobus market: the renault-weride partnership,"I've been tracking the autonomous vehicle space like tesla to find a good point to sell it, and the news about weride caught my attention. their plan to launch a mass-produced robobus by 2030 for the european market seems like a big shift.

This partnership raises some interesting questions for me. for a while, the market's been obsessed with robotaxis, but the b2b robobus model seems more stable, with predictable, long-term revenue. how do we value a company focused on this niche, given that most of the public comps are in the robotaxi space?

The focus on meeting unified eu standards is also a crucial point. this could be a massive de-risking factor and a significant moat. it's a great example of regulatory arbitrage, and a company's ability to navigate these hurdles could be a huge long-term value driver. weride has global experience, including in strict markets like japan, which suggests they can clear these regulatory obstacles.

Finally, there's the ""nvidia effect"" weride is the only company in the autonomous driving field that nvidia has directly invested in. this partnership with renault provides a fundamental basis for a long-term investment thesis, moving it beyond a purely speculative ai play. I'm curious to hear other traders' thoughts on this. is the robobus market a more stable segment for autonomous driving? how do you factor in strategic partnerships and regulatory wins into your analysis?",6,0,1758118615.0,2025-09-17T14:16:55+00:00,t3_1njednu,stocks

359,NVDA,China bans tech companies from buying Nvidia’s AI chips,"     China’s internet regulator has banned the country’s biggest technology companies from buying Nvidia’s artificial intelligence chips, as Beijing steps up efforts to boost its domestic industry and compete with the US.

The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) told companies, including ByteDance and Alibaba, this week to end their testing and orders of the RTX Pro 6000D, Nvidia’s tailor-made product for the country, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.

Several companies had indicated they would order tens of thousands of the RTX Pro 6000D, and had started testing and verification work with Nvidia’s server suppliers, the people said.

After receiving the CAC order, the companies told their suppliers to stop the work, the people added.

The ban goes beyond earlier guidance from regulators that focused on the H20, Nvidia’s other China-only chip widely used for AI. It comes after Chinese regulators concluded that domestic chips had attained performance comparable to those of Nvidia’s models used in China.

Jensen Huang, chief executive of Nvidia, told reporters in London on Wednesday that he expected to discuss the chipmaker’s ability to do business in China with Donald Trump that evening during the US president’s state visit to the UK.

“We can only be in service of a market if the country wants us to be,” he said. “I’m disappointed with what I see. But they have larger agendas to work out, between China and the US, and I’m understanding of that. We are patient about it.” 

Beijing is putting pressure on Chinese tech companies to boost the country’s homegrown semiconductor industry and break their reliance on Nvidia so it can compete in an AI race against the US.

“The message is now loud and clear,” said an executive at one of the tech companies. “Earlier, people had hopes of renewed Nvidia supply if the geopolitical situation improves. Now it’s all hands on deck to build the domestic system.”

Nvidia started producing chips tailored for the Chinese market after former US President Joe Biden banned the company from exporting its most powerful products to China, in an effort to rein in Beijing’s progress on AI.

Beijing’s regulators have recently summoned domestic chipmakers such as Huawei and Cambricon, as well as Alibaba and search engine giant Baidu, which also make their own semiconductors, to report how their products compare against Nvidia’s China chips, according to one of the people with knowledge of the matter.

They concluded that China’s AI processors had reached a level comparable to or exceeding that of the Nvidia products allowed under export controls, the person added.

China says Nvidia violated antitrust law when it bought Mellanox

The Financial Times reported last month that China’s chipmakers were seeking to triple the country’s total output of AI processors next year.

“The top-level consensus now is there’s going to be enough domestic supply to meet demand without having to buy Nvidia chips,” said an industry insider.

Nvidia introduced the RTX Pro 6000D in July during Huang’s visit to Beijing, when the US company also said Washington was easing its previous ban on the H20 chip.

China’s regulators, including the CAC, have warned tech companies against buying Nvidia’s H20, asking them to justify having purchased them over domestic products, the FT reported last month.

The RTX Pro 6000D, which the company has said could be used in automated manufacturing, was the last product Nvidia was allowed to sell in China in significant volumes.

Alibaba, ByteDance, the CAC and Nvidia did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

262,NVDA,SAFE way to play the China stock frenzy,"Disclaimer: 
As a person who lost $17k in BABA stock and still has $3k unrealized losses in Bidu, I would like to share my takeaways from playing with the chinese stocks. 

1. First thing first, control your positions. Don't let any 1 chinese stock oversize your portfolio 
2. Set a 30% stop trailing loss. Let them ride. 
3. If i were to do it again, I would buy qcom, sn and apple to enjoy the Chinese stocks frenzy. I would not touch a single individual emerging market stock, but I'd buy US tech stocks that have good Chinese market exposure. I should have bought qcom apple in 2021 to enjoy the ride. 
4. If you believe in china market, buy kweb, buy fxi, and don't overload A single chinese stock. It can have large amount of black swan risk, like baba did. You simply cannot predict if CCP will be monitoring a singke company or a few companies. 
5. Btw, i am not selling my baba and bidu stocks now. I still think they have legs even at this level $162, $125. I think Bidu has better values than baba. Baba is close to my 2021 sellinv price of $170. It shall go above than $170. 

My loss in baba was overcome by nvda gains. 
It's my one and only material loss on my journey as a hybrid investor.

263,NVDA,So U.S. becomes the world’s capital magnet?,"Since 2007, foreign ownership of U.S. financial assets has grown at an annual rate of 7.2%, far outpacing the 4.7% growth rate of U.S. ownership of foreign assets, reflecting the sustained global appetite for U.S. markets.

While in Q1 2025, foreign investors held over $55 trillion in U.S. financial assets—almost 1.6 times the value of U.S. holdings abroad—underscoring America’s increasingly solid position as a net capital importer.

Key turning points include the 2008 financial crisis and the 2020 pandemic, when U.S. equities and dollar assets attracted even more safe-haven flows, widening the gap further.

388,NVDA,Tesla’s shares have finally turned positive for the year.,"After a dismal first quarter, which was the worst for the stock in any period since 2022, and a brutal start to April, following President Donald Trump’s announcement of sweeping new tariffs, Wall Street has again rallied around the electric vehicle maker.

The stock rose 3.6% on Monday to $410.26, topping its closing price of 2024 by over $6. It’s up 85% since bottoming for the year at $221.86 on April 4. A new filing revealed that CEO Elon Musk purchased about $1 billion worth of shares in the company through his family foundation.

It’s the second straight year Tesla has bounced back after a down first quarter. Last year, the shares fell 29% in the first three months before ending up 63% for 2024.

389,NVDA,So that oil spike? Already gone,"In June 2025, conflict broke out between Israel and Iran. While it briefly pushed oil prices higher, it did not alter the broader trend — Brent crude remains well below its 2022 Russia–Ukraine war peak.

Historically, the sharpest oil shocks were tied to major geopolitical events: the 1990 Gulf War, the 2003 Iraq War, the 2011 Arab Spring, and the 2022 Russia–Ukraine war — all of which drove nominal oil prices sharply upward.

This time, however, the “oil price shock” faded quickly. Nominal prices are still below the long-term average since 1983 (around $42), suggesting markets have developed stronger immunity to geopolitical flare-ups.

121,NVDA,Nobody watching APLD,"Nobody on here is really talking about Applied Digital (APLD) and I think it has serious potential. The stock is sitting around 19.50 right now and it has already run over 70 percent in the last three months. What makes it interesting is not just the chart but the actual business story.

APLD is building out high performance data centers specifically designed for AI workloads. They already signed hosting contracts worth over 11 billion dollars, mostly with CoreWeave, which is one of the fastest growing names in the AI compute space. These are not small speculative deals either. They are long term leases that give APLD revenue visibility for years.

The company has about 200 megawatts of capacity now and plans to reach 400 to 500 megawatts by 2026. Each 100 megawatts can generate around 300 to 400 million in annual revenue. Analysts are projecting revenue to grow from about 450 million in fiscal 2024 to over 1.2 billion by fiscal 2026. That type of growth would support a market cap in the 3 to 4 billion range compared to about 2 billion today.

If AI demand stays hot and they continue hitting build out milestones, I think a reasonable short term price target is 25 to 27 by the end of this year. If momentum really catches on and retail wakes up to this play, I could see it testing 30. The risk is execution and concentration with a few clients, but the math lines up.

Right now everyone is watching NVDA and the mega caps but APLD is a pure play AI infrastructure stock that is still under the radar. I am betting it is going to get a lot more attention soon.

361,NVDA,Alphabet becomes fourth company to reach $3 trillion market cap,"Alphabet has joined the $3 trillion club.

Shares of the search giant jumped more than 4% on Monday, pushing the company into territory occupied only by Nvidia, Microsoft and Apple.

The stock got a big lift in early September from an antitrust ruling by a judge, whose penalties came in lighter than shareholders feared. The U.S. Department of Justice wanted Google to be forced to divest its Chrome browser, and last year a district court ruled that the company held an illegal monopoly in search and related advertising.

But Judge Amit Mehta decided against the most severe consequences proposed by the DOJ, which sent shares soaring to a record. After the big rally, President Donald Trump congratulated the company and called it “a very good day.”

Alphabet shares are now up more than 30% this year, compared to the 15% gain for the Nasdaq.

The $3 trillion milestone comes roughly 20 years after Google’s IPO and a little more than 10 years after of the creation of Alphabet as a holding company, with Google its prime subsidiary. .

CEO Sundar Pichai was named CEO of Alphabet in 2019, replacing co-founder Larry Page. Pichai’s latest challenge has been the surge of new competition due to the rise of artificial intelligence, which the company has had to manage through while also fending off an aggressive set of regulators in the U.S. and Europe.

The rise of Perplexity and OpenAI ended up helping Google land the recent favorable antitrust ruling. The company’s hopes of becoming a major AI player largely ride with Gemini, Google’s flagship suite of AI models.

95,NVDA,China finds Nvidia broke antitrust law and extends probe. Shares are dropping.,"Nvidia shares were under pressure ahead of Monday’s stock market open after China’s top regulatory authority said the U.S. chipmaker has violated the country’s antitrust rules.

The State Administration for Market Regulation announced that following a preliminary investigation, Nvidia was found to be in breach of those rules, with relation to its acquisition of Mellanox Technology Co., Ltd. with Restrictive Conditions.

“The State Administration for Market Regulation decided to conduct further investigation in accordance with the law,” the SAMR said in a brief statement

Shares of Nvidia were down more than 2% in premarket trade.

The world’s biggest company by market cap, Nvidia shares have gained 32% this year.

China’s anti-monopoly body said last December that it was opening an antitrust investigation into Nvidia, making reference to the chipmaker’s acquisition of Israeli networking technology group Mellanox. Nvidia announced the $6.9 billion deal in 2019, but it didn’t close until April 2020, after approval from authorities in China and elsewhere.

Bloomberg reported that Nvidia has indicated pressure by China regulators to keep supplying chips to local companies, in exchange for approving that deal. Nvidia announced this summer that the U.S. would allow the company to sell its H20 AI chips made specifically for China to comply with export controls to that nation after a U.S. ban in the spring.

Chinese officials have discouraged businesses from using its chips, amid claims they are a security risk, according to reports. While its latest results were deemed by some analysts to be lackluster, others have said investors are putting too much focus on its China business.

The report comes amid trade talks between Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer with China’s China’s Vice Premier He Lifeng and top trade negotiator Li Chenggang in Madrid. Bessent said Monday that a deal to keep ByteDance’s TikTok running in the U.S. is getting close, though that could hinge on China trade concession demands.",501,72,1757928258.0,2025-09-15T09:24:18+00:00,t3_1nhh3vt,StockMarket

2️⃣ The yellow line represents the ISM Manufacturing PMI. A reading below 50 signals contraction in manufacturing activity, while above 50 indicates expansion, making it a key leading indicator of economic health.

3️⃣ The red line represents the 3-month revision rate of S&amp;P 500 earnings forecasts, which measures analysts’ adjustments to corporate profit expectations. Negative values reflect downward revisions.

Historically, there has been a strong positive correlation between the ISM PMI and S&amp;P 500 earnings revisions, with both indicators moving in close alignment. Currently, both PMI and earnings revisions are trending lower, suggesting potential downside risks to corporate profits ahead. Investors should remain alert to market risks.

3. Under the inflation scenario, upside potential is far greater — $4,080 by Dec 2025 and an astonishing $8,926 by Dec 2030.
4. The period from 2020 onward is marked as the “Golden Decade,” suggesting analysts see gold entering a prolonged bull cycle.

362,NVDA,Mag 7: exposure to AI downside,"Hi everyone,

A quick question: out of the Mag 7, which do you think have the largest and lowest downside potential in case AI does not turn out to be the goldmine many think/thought it could be?

There are increasing concerns around the current version of AI (LLMs) being limited and not able to reach AGI (see, for instance, Yann Lecun’s take on it), coupled with concerns around monetisation (or, at least, monetisation in a scale compatible with providing good returns on the huge capital being invested), hence my question.

I think Nvidia is the top loser in that scenario, and Tesla the least exposed. Not sure about the other ones.

Thank you!

P.S.: My current Mag7 top pick for the medium-long term is Alphabet.",89,83,1757864536.0,2025-09-14T15:42:16+00:00,t3_1ngujqq,stocks

-The price action has been very promising with 9 Green Day's out of the last 10 days. Although they have been small gains each day, I believe the big gain days are coming soon! Just look at the chart. It is coiled like crazy consolidating in this $16-$18 price range for 2 months.. it is ready to bounce whether you like it or not ! Don't forget there's ONLY 22million shares outstanding so this stock moves quick!

﻿-all companies have debt but GRRR only has about $16-$18 mil of debt and their goal is to pay off all their debt by year end. The company's objective is to be cash flow positive by 2026!

﻿﻿Market Cap of ONLY $400mil, are you KIDDING ME??? For a company that just received a $100mil support from Alyeska Investment Group, a $30billion company, and we are sitting under $35-$40/share is insanely cheap. Alyeska could have invested into any company they wanted to but im sure they were smart enough to do their research to pick GRRR as an investment that they could double or triple their money. If they weren't smart they would not be worth $30billion ! Also that means they have enough money that they will NOT DILUTE any time soon!
﻿﻿

• I see this as a great opportunity for those who are not in this stock as this can double your money in the next few months when it runs up! For those who are already in it, try to add more here under $20 because history repeats itself... this thing can fly like it did back in March.

I believe this is the CHEAPEST, most
UNDERVALUED company in the Al space and we should take advantage before it's too late. Good luck to everyone!

71,NVDA,"OpenAI, ORCL, NVDA and the UK","The question has to be asked, who is funding OpenAI moving forward? 

$300 billion to Oracle. Projected cash burn through 2029 is $115 billion (as of a few days ago). And now this comes out:   OPENAI, NVIDIA TO ANNOUNCE BILLIONS IN UK DATA CENTER PROJECTS

So that lands them in the realm of needing maybe $500+ billion in the next 4 years? They don’t make money, they burn money, so it’s not coming out of pocket. Maybe they go public and aim for a 1 trillion starting valuation? I know there are changes with their MSFT deal happening right now, not sure if listing is on the table. Or is the US government just giving them a blank check? None of these options seem overly likely.

$ wise none of this adds up, and it’s really starting to look like a giant scam to me. Yes ai has great uses, yes it is not going anywhere. But it’s also not profitable, at all. Not even close. All of the mega caps are burning huge amounts of money getting this all set up, with the plan to monetize it down the road. META had its panic moment when they started overpaying to poach talent, probably because they realized that llm’s hit a wall that would result in ai not being as profitable as projected. 

I think we may be in the stage where all companies start lying about future capex and revenue streams. At this point they have to. Just look at NVDA, renting back its own products lol, clever, but not actually a good thing. 

If the mega caps admit they need to scale back the ai roll out or drastically extend the timelines to complete these data center projects, then bye bye stock price. But it is hard for public companies to just straight up lie. OpenAI has less public eyeballs on their books. Can they really afford all of this? They are saying they can, and ORCL had an amazing day thanks to that. So maybe that is the play now. As the music gets closer to stopping, we will see more and more projects get announced from OpenAI and possibly some of the other non-publicly traded ai companies. 

These lies buy the industry time, which will allow the publicly traded companies to do offerings, maybe sell some stock, and just generally prepare for the coming market downturn. In turn, they agree to support the companies that are helping them fake these expansion / future revenue numbers right now. Because when the ball drops, and the capex bonfire is still burning hot, it’s going to get ugly. 

When will this finally fall apart? Who knows. Maybe 3 months. Maybe 1 year. Maybe 2 years if the government drops rates to zero and hands out blank checks to all ai companies. But it will hit, and it won’t be pretty. The warning signs are already showing. ",50,28,1757645855.0,2025-09-12T02:57:35+00:00,t3_1nes68a,stocks

126,NVDA,"$GLXY $CRWV- A massive deal for StarGate between CoreWeave, Galaxy and a Hyperscaler - Additional New 2.7 GigaWatts of Power Unaccounted For","StarGate is here and one does not just bring on GigaWatts of power to a building without massive expertise, knowhow, land rights and government help for expediency on permitting. I have no idea on the timing of this but the tea leaves are all right in front of us.

**TL;DR:** I believe a massive new deal is brewing for Giga-Scale AI Factory capacity between CoreWeave, Galaxy, and an AI HyperScaler. New Government regulations are lightspeeding the permitting process and allowing companies to start building while air permits are being obtained. This should lead to new massive deals sooner in the near term rather than later. Even if the projects are years out. Giga-Scale powered AI Factories are here and the opportunity has never been better for companies like Galaxy. The providers (OpenAI, MSFT, Google, AWS) don't want to be landlords or data center builders and the data center builders don't want to be landlords-This is where Galaxy fits in.

First, who the hell is Galaxy and why are they important? Turns out, they are an up and coming Crypto (we have lots of space and power) to AI infrastructure play based out of Alfont, Texas.

Specifically, Helios is the is the campus where they have initial power and upcoming powered AI shells and newly closed land deals and power requests that are reportedly bringing **an additional 2.7 Gigawatts of fully functional powered AI GPU data center shells**.

To note, Oracle just closed a $300 Billion deal with OpenAI that is tied to StarGate and the quick notes on that are

* 4.5 GigaWatts of power
* Scheduled for first delivery by 2027\*
* $300 Billion contract over 5 years

Again, nobody just has GigaWatts of power on the US grid. It is rare earth mineral levels of concern right now. There is so much work and permitting on that amount of power scale that the government had to issue new executive orders to try and help expedite the process.

For Oracle they have about \~$10 Billion in cash and they are [reportedly (Bloomberg) preparing a $38 Billion debt package from various banks](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-04/banks-ready-38-billion-of-debt-for-data-centers-tied-to-oracle). Roughly to get 4.5 GigaWatts of power is going to cost you about $38+($32B - $60B) Billion and yield you $300 Billion over 5 years... Not bad. And it gives us a baseline of how to think about this. **\*Note this figure does not include Nvidia GPUS.** That's extra.

For Galaxy, they are already starting this process of bringing on massive new power for land acquisitions now giving them over 1500 sq acres of land in Texas with clearly the ability to add on more throughout the years even over the current amount. Literally, this is big new oil in the making right there in big ole Texas.

Here's the kicker, CoreWeave has been buying all (100%) of their announced and soon to be ready power for their initial phases I,II,III of totalled 800 MW of active compute power.

Just take a look of all the deals and power CoreWeave has committed to and it's not just partial. It's ALL OF IT.

4. **New land + 1 GW interconnect request:** In the **Q2’25 earnings call**, Galaxy said it entered a **PSA for 160 acres** and submitted a **1 GW load interconnection request** adjacent to Helios (this 1 GW is part of the broader “under study” pool).

The question becomes - Who is committing to that additional 2.7 GigaWatts of power?

And it's not just in Galaxies thoughts and ideas. They recently closed on land adjacent to Helios in 2024 of 160 acres and very recently an agreement mentioned in their Q2 earnings call alluded to another 160 acres is now a done deal. So from their Q2 we have an agreement to the now signed and recorded deed this is a very real acquisition and commitment for Galaxy. Especially, the 1 GW power interconnect request that came with the property.

https://preview.redd.it/y505m06zejof1.png?width=2305&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb8458d05d64a8369fd23786ab928b606ac02c26

Both of these deeds are from 2025 and are for the plots below in the large red square with green circles 33, 39 and I believe 37 give a total of another 160 acres. Everything that is highlighted or squared below is what Galaxy owns. The current Helios setup and committed 800 MW of active power is in the yellow square.

https://preview.redd.it/c14simu1fjof1.png?width=1248&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae1daeb6417548f90ef3474d5c99f17c95171cce

Even the neighboring plots are just a bunch of old people selling farmland. So the question becomes. Who is Galaxy building all of that active powered AI ready shells for? Again, at every turn CoreWeave has been the one to buy up the leases at a 15 year commit.

Now, if you remember there are additional tea leaves to follow here too. In the Q2 call Michael and team alluded to another extension that would be realized in Q3. We haven't heard about that as of yet. That is still a major Q3 catalyst we are all waiting for.

What we also know is that yesterday at the Goldman Sachs conference call the CoreWeave team was asked a question, ""are there or do you see any more multi-billion dollar deals being done?"" How CoreWeave replied was telling, they neither confirmed nor denied but what they did say is this.

* What they are seeing now is an inflection point in demand.
* Customers are coming to them for longer contracts (extended time periods)
* And customers are requesting the very highest end GPU's which are currently the GB Ultra 300's NVL72 racks.
* **We talked to insiders and even the NBIS deal as large as it is still doesn't fix the problem - They need still need more**
* **There is an insatiable demand for AI**

To me, what this is all saying is that reasoning models are burning through GPU's. Empirically I know this to be true but the comment from CoreWeave just outright confirms this. And to that point the very next hours of yesterday during Oracle's earnings call they reported a massive 300B data center deal and need.

So right there, only hours later another major multi-billion dollar deal was being done.

And Michael alluded to that whatever the NBIS deal is that still isn't enough. But why? Reasoning models while so much better than before they are slower than hell at returning an answer. Sam Altman literally said, ""we have even way larger and better models but we don't have the capacity (GPU'S) to give them to you.""

Tracking it all, there is still an insatiable demand and obvious capacity constraints.

Again, what is Galaxy doing buying all this land and land studying 2.7 GigaWatts of additional power for? To me, that has to be some NDA'd customer that is committing to that data center scale. So, why not CoreWeave? They are already a preferred customer and have commited to 800 MW already from Galaxy.

And it gets even better.

Remember that the US power grid is so strained right now anyone gaining access to it is basically given contract. Literally, that is the Vineland NJ deal for NBIS and Microsoft. The initial deal from MSFT is you have 200 MW - 300 MW of power coming online, ""We'll take that right now."" No questions asked.

What if at some milestone i.e. permit checkmark or otherwise Galaxy says we are ready to establish Phase 4, 5, 6, 7 to commit/contract out? That I know is going to occur but the only real question I have is how fast can that unbeknownst to me milestone occur to give an official deal channel from CoreWeave with Galaxy and thus CoreWeave to Hyperscaler?

Well, if you remember, President Trump and the EPA now have an official fast track AI infrastructure plan which is to remove hurdles and obstacles to get AI powered shells up and going as fast as possible. That's net new from just a couple months ago.

The largest benefit that will shave off 18-30 months of a normal project is letting the landlord build first without have any emissions and working in parrell for the other land and water regulations that have to occur whilst trying to fast track those parts and pieces too.

**Current Understanding of New EPA Rules**

* **Executive Order is in force.** EO **14318** “Accelerating Federal Permitting of Data Center Infrastructure” was signed **July 23, 2025** and published in the Federal Register **July 28, 2025**. It directs agencies to use FAST-41, NEPA categorical exclusions, and other shortcuts for large (100 MW+) AI data centers and their power infrastructure. [The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/07/accelerating-federal-permitting-of-data-center-infrastructure/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **EPA has announced rulemaking (proposed).** On **Sept 9, 2025**, EPA said it will revise the “**Begin Actual Construction**” definition under Clean Air Act NSR so **non-emitting work can start before air permits are issued**; formal rule text isn’t final yet. [US EPA](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-announces-permitting-reform-provide-clarity-expedite-construction-essential-power?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **FAST-41 dashboard exists but no AI data centers listed yet.** The Permitting Council’s dashboard shows covered/transparency projects; as of today there’s **no clearly labeled AI data center project** posted. (Categories are public, but specific AI DC entries aren’t there yet.) [Performance.gov Permitting Council](https://www.permits.performance.gov/projects/fast-41-covered?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

The update of you can begin construction now before needing the Clean Air Act NSR air permits are needed to begin non-emitting work. That's massive. I believe this could usher in commitments and deal sign-offs a lot sooner.

You show the hyperscaler you have a powered shell commit and they are ready to contract up; right way. For these reasons I believe we may get a massive new deal in the range of $22 - $50 Billion dollars to assure that whatever capacity Galaxy and CoreWeave yield is committed to throughout a longer 7 - 10 year capacity commitment.

This is the only thing that makes sense for what Galaxy is doing. Of course I could be wrong or my timeline could be way off so we shall see.

Here is Helios in 2024

https://preview.redd.it/1xnbc7o6fjof1.png?width=1491&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e0cc8822e2da508d1f6f22ff0731f17439bf719

If this looks crude and unorganized but effective that's because it is. This is mostly the power Galaxy's Helios had up and running for coin mining operations converted now over for the AI new big oil gold rush.

Interestingly Nvidia (NVDA) has released a new blog post on September 9th 2025 giving reference designs for what Giga-Scale AI Factories should look like and as you see the comparison they are nothing what the current Helios design looks like today.

[NVIDIA Partners With AI Infrastructure Ecosystem to Unveil Reference Design for Giga-Scale AI Factories](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ai-factories-reference-design/)

At the AI Infrastructure Summit, NVIDIA’s Ian Buck introduces a reference design and partner-driven strategy to transform global infrastructure for high-performance, energy-efficient AI.

Data center Giga-Scale factories are here and Galaxy has a front row seat to massive income and incoming AI capex. Hyperscalers are paying out huge amounts of cash to anyone and everyone who can procure massive amounts of power. Galaxy is actively doing just this.

**My current positions:** I've opened a small position in GLXY and will be adding more Today!

393,NVDA,Revenue growth as a driver of tech valuations,"The chart maps the forward P/E ratios of the top 30 U.S. technology stocks against their projected three-year revenue CAGR.

A clear positive correlation emerges, with higher-growth companies generally commanding higher valuations.

Growth names like PLTR, and TSLA show strong revenue forecasts, but their valuations stand far above peers, indicating premium pricing, while emerging small-cap AIFU is also notable.

Mature giants such as Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft deliver steady performance, with both growth and valuations sitting at mid-range levels.

The correlation coefficient of 0.59 suggests that while revenue growth is a key driver of valuations, it is not the only factor at play.

364,NVDA,WeRide – Quietly Crushing the Autonomous Driving Game,"Alright, let’s talk about a ticker nobody’s giving enough love: WeRide ($WRD).

Yeah, their earnings were 2 months ago, but sometimes you gotta let the hype die down and actually look at the numbers. And holy hell, these guys are quietly building one of the strongest plays in autonomous driving.

Q2 ‘25 Recap:

* Total revenue hit $17.8M, up 60% YoY.
* Robotaxi revenue exploded +836% YoY to $6.4M. That’s now over a third of their total business – it’s not a “pilot program” anymore, it’s a legit revenue driver.
* Gross profit climbed 40% YoY, with gross margin sitting pretty at 28%. Scaling AND getting more efficient. Most of their competitors can’t say that.
* They dropped HPC 3.0, running on NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Thor. This isn’t just marketing fluff – it cuts system cost in half while keeping it fully automotive-grade. Lower costs + better scalability = every fleet rollout becomes more profitable.
* Market Cap still only 2.7 Billion - potential 10x in coming years

Global footprint (bigger than most people realize):

* Abu Dhabi: robotaxi fleet tripled since Dec ‘24. Over 2,200 days of safe ops – regulators love that.
* Saudi Arabia: first company to run robotaxis in Riyadh. Major flex in the Middle East.
* Singapur: First operating autonomous vehicle without a safety driver in South-East Asia
* Permits in 6 countries.
* Uber and Grab partnership: the real kicker. WeRide’s tech is getting plugged into Uber’s and Grab's ecosystems, with plans for 15 cities outside US/China in the next 5 years. Uber also tossed in a $100M investment.

People sleep on this – WeRide isn’t just pushing one product. They’ve got:

* Robotaxis (obviously)
* Robobusses
* Robovans (autonomous logistics/delivery)
* Robosweepers (city sanitation, already deployed)
* Other mobility/transport solutions, all running on the WeRide One Platform.

That means multiple revenue streams across mobility + logistics + smart city services. They’re building an ecosystem.

Look, the stock isn’t mooning *yet*. They’re still in growth mode, and yes, net income is red. But think about it: massive YoY growth, global ops scaling, partnerships with Uber, Grab, Lenovo and NVIDIA, and a diversified portfolio. Compare that to the other AV players stuck in testing loops or bleeding cash without a clear roadmap.

This is how a long game looks – grab market share, get permits, build trust with regulators, diversify products, line up big-name partners, and then ride the revenue curve.

TL;DR  
2 months after earnings and I’m still hyped:

* Revenue up 60%, robotaxi rev up 836%.
* NVIDIA-powered HPC 3.0 = cheaper, faster scaling.
* Global expansion (Abu Dhabi, Saudi, Singapur, 6 permits worldwide).
* Uber deal with $100M backing.
* Broad product lineup beyond taxis.

I’m not saying it’s going 10x overnight, but this smells like a sleeper growth stock that’ll sneak up on everyone. While the herd chases Tesla and Waymo FSD headlines, WeRide is quietly racking up cities, fleets, and partnerships.",27,17,1757524680.0,2025-09-10T17:18:00+00:00,t3_1ndkcue,stocks
330,NVDA,Why would hyperscalers spend so much with $ORCL instead of just spending themselves?,"UPDATE: It's apparently$300B just from OpeniAI. So yeah, like I hypothesized, the hyperscalers don't need shit from Oracle and there is a high chance most of this doesn't happen. OpenAI can't afford $300B.

I don't get it. They say they got $400B in backlogs from only a few customers, which means like $100B+ per customer. Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta, Google, Amazon...

There are a handful of companies on the entire planet which that describes, and they can build their own stuff. Why, for example, would Meta or Amazon give Oracle $50B just to build a data center that doesn't even exist yet anyway?

It's one thing to buy infrastructure that already exists and that you want right now, it's another thing to order infrastructure that doesn't even exist when you already know how to build your own.

The whole cloud revenue/order backlog thing looks like bullshit to me. It's going to grow $144B in cloud revenue in 5 years? Uh, I don't see Google, Microsoft, or Amazon doubling cloud revenue every year, so how the fuck is Oracle?

365,NVDA,Broadcom Cements Its AI Credentials,"**Broadcom (AVGO) $342**

I first bought Broadcom more than a year ago for $150, and added more yesterday around $340, deciding to take the plunge after holding on and realizing that the price wouldn’t come down.

Broadcom (AVGO) the second largest AI chipmaker, and the leader by far in custom GPUs, and datacenter networking gear declared July quarter results that just passed estimates by a whisker.

The stock, however, rallied massively the next day as the ebullient CEO, Hock Tan talked up a massive $110Bn backlog , a new $10Bn customer and an expanding TAM for custom silicon and datacenter networking.

**The quarterly results and guidance at a glance**

* Q3 Non-GAAP EPS of $1.69 beat by $0.03.
* Revenue of $15.95Bn (+22.0% YoY) beat by $130Mn. Broadcom’s revenue growth rest on two pillars, AI 32% and VMware 36% of sales, so an overall 22% growth is  excellent for the company.
* Adjusted EBITDA of $10.7Bn, with a 67% margin.
* A massive cash haul of 7.2Bn less Capex of just $142Mn, gave it an FCF of $7 Bn or 44% of revenue – **Very impressive.**

**Guidance was also close to estimates on supply constraints.**

The good stuff came during the earnings call, which was much more illuminating; CEO Hock Tan was very enthused about AI prospects, and talked about sufficiently faster growth and a massive backlog of $110Bn, plus he confirmed adding a new customer, rumored to be OpenAI.

This is one company and CEO, I respect tremendously. Hock Tan whose tenure was extended to 2030 by the board always talks up a big game; more importantly he delivers like Nvidia's Jensen Huang, and Arista Networks', Jayshree Ullal. 

**From Broadcom’s Q3 Earnings call:**

&gt;

**Broadcom’s strengths and positive catalysts**

**AI revenue share keeps rising:** The share of AI revenue has gone up to an estimated 32-33% of FY2025 sales from 24% last year and based on management’s confidence in Ethernet and custom silicon scale ups and scale outs it should grow to $34Bn in FY2026, or 43% of sales and $56Bn in FY2027 or 61% of total sales. Broadcom’s sales and earnings multiples expand with each percentage increase of AI in the total mix.

**Ethernet can increase market share:** Management believes that hyperscalers prefer Ethernet “as one single fabric for both scale-out and scale-up,” and Broadcom’s Tomahawk switches, Jericho routers, and NICs can continue to grow and gain datacenter connectivity share over competitors like Nvidia, Arista Networks and Marvell.

**High margin SaaS continues to grow:** VMware continues to be a pillar of strength, with 17% high margin revenue growth. Besides, Broadcom is positioning VMware as an integrated AI solution with custom silicon.

**Strong margins:** Broadcom has strong 37% adjusted operating and 44% operating cash flow margins.

**Increasing TAM:** Previously, management had indicated that FY2026 AI revenue growth might be similar to FY2025 (roughly +50–60% YoY). But now, with the addition of a fourth hyperscaler, Broadcom’s 2026’s AI growth to “accelerate” beyond that rate, likely between 60 and 70%. The new $10Bn+ XPU customer has moved to production for AI server racks with shipments scheduled to begin in Q3 FY2026. This deal suggests several million custom AI chips could be delivered, aimed at AI inference workloads, which is the next big frontier as it takes over from training, and cements Broadcom as one of the biggest and preferred inference players.  Inference requires significantly more tokenization than training, which means hyperscalers will have to continue investing, to continue getting higher throughput at lower costs, which is key to Broadcom’s success.

128,NVDA,Turned $21k into $41.5k on GOOGL calls. Diamond hands actually worked?!,"Alright you smooth-brained degenerates, gather ‘round.

Back in February, I got horny for tendies and loaded up on GOOGL $150 LEAPS (01/16/26) for a fat -21k debit. My boomer brain thought, “Google basically owns the internet, AI is juicing the stonk, how bad could it be?”

Fast forward to last week, and those bad boys went vertical harder than my uncle after a couple blue pills. I panic-sold (because I’m still a paper-handed coward at heart) and locked in +41,500 on the same contracts. Net? Walked away with about +20.5k profit.

For once, the WSB prophecy came true: buy calls, wait, ???, profit.

TL;DR: Bought GOOGL $150 LEAPS for $21k → sold them for $41.5k → walked with $20.5k gain → still don’t know what I’m doing.

367,NVDA,Nebius Moves To The Big Leagues,"**The $17.4Bn to $19.4Bn Nebius - Microsoft Deal**

NBIS ($96)

**This is a tremendous deal for Nebius.**

My investment thesis for Nebius was based on its technical/engineering strengths as a medium sized Neocloud provider democratizing AI infrastructure for medium sized businesses who did not want or need to pay exorbitant fees to AWS or the other hyperscalers. Prior to this deal, its biggest customer was Shopify and it was well on its way to expanding its reach to companies at, or below Shopify’s size.

**Nebius' competitive advantages:** Its biggest strengths lie in its full software stack, honed by decades of engineering talent from the ex Yandex team, instead of being a brute provider of GPU‘s in scale like Coreweave, which meant that it had the competitive advantage of not being sucked into lower pricing from just renting out GPUs. It could command a higher price and margin than other Neocloud providers, by focusing more on providing a platform and a superior stack of solutions, plus its customers were supposed to be smaller, giving it more bargaining power. Its second competitive advantage is its strategic relationship with Nvidia, which allows it to commit and guarantee computing power, the way it did with Microsoft. It has the GPUs and the datacenter infrastructure to ensure that there are no supply constraints or bottlenecks.

**Excellent Return On Investment**: Prior to this deal, its estimated sales growth was $0.6Bn in 2025, growing to $9Bn by 2030, and my target was 8X sales or a market cap of $72Bn, which was about 5x the market cap of $15Bn it was selling at till yesterday - so an almost 5x return over 5 years or 37% per year. **Pretty hefty.**

**Even better ROI:** A deal of $18Bn at mid-point clearly changes these estimates and I’m conservatively forecasting the six year deal adds at least $2Bn to revenue each year. And of course, they will get growth from other clients, a massive deal like this gives them even more cachet - my revised sales target for 2030 is $13.5Bn, valuing Nebius at 10x sales = $135Bn. CEO, Arkady Volozh calls this just the beginning, and so far he has walked the talk. At $135Bn we could be looking at almost 7x the current market cap of $22.6Bn (at a price of$95), or a return of 42% per year.

**Need to raise capital:** They will need to raise at least $3-5Bn in the next 2-3 years from both debt and equity, to play in the majors, but what’s also amazing is that they are financing this with Microsoft’s cash and credit, which means the dilution/interest payments will not be that high. Nebius still comes out way ahead with another 30% increase in share count, if needed at this price. Coreweave has $7.5 billion in long-term debt with about $7 billion in sales in 2025 with around $30 billion worth of contracts, and their growth trajectory confirms that capital raises are absolutely necessary for Neoclouds to thrive. 

**Adding more shares:** I was very content to hold and even sold off some in the mid-sixties after getting 2.6x my purchase price of $23, but now I think the stock is still worth buying even though it has shot up 45% in a day, considering where this company could go in the next five years. This deal actually validates my original thesis and I have no qualms about pyramiding (adding smaller quantities) to my holding.  
**To be sure, this increases the risks and challenges, namely execution, reduction in AI demand, enhanced competition, and dilution, but I think the risks are worth it.**",62,30,1757468246.0,2025-09-10T01:37:26+00:00,t3_1nd1djr,stocks
368,NVDA,Oracle pops 13% on growth projections even as earnings miss estimates,"Oracle shares spiked 15% in extended trading on Tuesday after the database software maker indicated hefty growth prospects even as earnings and revenue missed estimates.

Here’s how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus:

* **Earnings per share:** $1.47 adjusted vs. $1.48 expected
* **Revenue:** $14.93 billion vs. $15.04 billion expected

Revenue increased 12% from a year earlier during the quarter, which ended on Aug. 31, according to a statement. Net income was about flat at $2.93 billion, or $1.01 per share, compared to $2.93 billion, or $1.03 per share, in the same quarter last year.

Oracle said its remaining performance obligation, a measure of contracted revenue that has not yet been contracted, now stands at $455 billion, up some 359% from a year earlier. During the quarter OpenAI said it signed an agreement with Oracle to develop 4.5 gigawatts of U.S. data center capacity.

Alongside larger cloud providers such as Microsoft, Oracle has been one of the big winners of the AI boom, due to its cloud infrastructure business and its access to Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) needed for large workloads. CEO Safra Catz said in the statement that the company signed four multibillion-dollar contracts with three different customers in the quarter.

Also in the quarter, Oracle said cloud rival Google’s Gemini artificial intelligence models would become available on Oracle’s cloud infrastructure.

Oracle shares hit a record last month and are up 45% in 2025 as of Tuesday’s close, while the S&amp;P 500 index has gained 11%.

331,NVDA,$160k YOLO into $MU Micron because memory go BOOM. Up $90k so far.,"I dumped my entire 401k into OTM LEAPS on $MU when they reported their 2025 Q3 earnings. They had a double beat and raised guidance yet the stock fell 20%. HBM is the second biggest bottleneck for AI infrastructure, behind COWOS packaging. HBM unit sales are expected to grow 15x by 2035. ASP will continue to go up as each new HBM generation production comes available. SK Hynix has already reported they will be increasing ASP for their HBM4 by 70% vs HBM3E. HBM is also the highest margin part of the business.

Nvidia is innovating their compute power per chip by 100%-200% every 2 years but memory makers are only innovating at a rate of 50%-100% every 2 years. So each GPU, TPU, XPU will require more and more HBM stacks per chip. Also, as HBM continues to innovate, each generation requires more space on the wafer so less chips/wafer, the complexity gets harder and harder, and the yield takes longer and longer to ramp.

Micron is aggressively taking market share from Samsung and it is the only DRAM maker headquartered in the US. Micron also claims it's HBM stack is 30% more power effective than the competition. Looking at valuations, Micron is still priced as a cyclical stock but is starting to transition into a secular stock.

87,NVDA,"Broadcom’s growth in custom AI chips has raised concerns among Nvidia investors, but analysts see room for both to succeed as the AI compute and networking market could reach $2 trillion by 2030.","Broadcom added a new customer expected to contribute $10 billion next year, potentially doubling its AI chip revenue in two years.

Melius analysts note that Nvidia’s share may decline over time as custom-chip makers like Broadcom aim for \~30% of the market. However, Nvidia’s loyal developer ecosystem and CUDA platform help it capture the majority of AI profits, similar to Apple’s approach in smartphones. If Broadcom reaches 20% of the projected $2 trillion market and Nvidia maintains 40%, both stocks could rise substantially.

Nvidia currently holds over 70% of the serviceable AI, networking, and compute market, expected to exceed $300 billion this year. OpenAI, likely Broadcom’s fourth customer, plans $115 billion in spending through 2029.

88,NVDA,Richtech Robotics (part of Nvidia Connect) is going places 🚀,"I posted over in pennystocks over the weekend after I saw the charts lining up on Friday, but it barely received any attention. Since then Richtech is up 17%


Alright, let's cut through the noise and get to the point, because frankly, most people just don't get this. Richtech Robotics isn't just another company; it's a key player in a market that's about to explode to $25 billion by 2030. They're literally solving the labor crisis with their robots—Titan, Adam, Scorpion—and they've already got big names like the Texas Rangers and Hilton on board. This isn't surprising, of course. The Titan robot snagged ""Robotics Innovation of the Year"" for a reason , and anyone paying attention knows they're working with NVIDIA's top-tier AI tech. They're building the future, and everyone else is just trying to keep up. 


Now, on to the charts. You don't need to be a genius to see this, but it helps. The stock is currently undergoing a completely expected, and frankly, healthy correction, trading at a recent low of $2.54. The recent price action has shown a marginal breakdown through the $2.80 support level , which is the precise moment when the weak hands panic and sell. This is nothing more than a strategic, short-term dip caused by their brilliant $100 million at-the-market share offering. They took advantage of peak interest in the company to secure a massive cash infusion, which is exactly what a smart, growing company does. It's a small detour before the real climb begins, and it's a perfect entry point for those of us who saw the play coming. 


The recent news flow is just a series of expected victories. The stock's inclusion in the Russell 2000® Index? A mere formality. This simply forces a whole wave of new institutional money to buy in, validating what I already knew. And now they've locked in a new contract with a top-five automotive dealership in the U.S. after a successful pilot program. Obviously, they're not just expanding; they're securing their position as an industry leader. Add in their new China joint venture and a $4 million sales agreement that’s set to boost Q4 revenue , and you can see a clear path to market dominance. A 400% increase in manufacturing capacity  is a strategic move, not a desperate one. 


I've been watching the institutional ownership, and it's almost amusing. The big players are finally catching on, with institutional ownership jumping 115.67% last quarter. BlackRock, Vanguard, and Bank of America are scrambling to add shares, with BlackRock's position up by an impressive 387.7% in Q2 2025. Their frantic buying is a clear sign they’re trying to catch up to the truly insightful investors who got in early. It’s a powerful validation, I suppose, if you needed it. 


So, let's wrap this up. Richtech Robotics is the real deal. The technicals are flawless, the catalysts are perfectly timed, and the institutions are finally coming around. The analyst consensus of a ""Strong Buy""  and price targets up to $3.50  are just numbers confirming what a superior analysis already reveals. It’s a high-risk, high-reward situation, but only if you lack confidence. For those of us who know what we're doing, this is simply the beginning of an inevitable upward trajectory. You're welcome.

267,NVDA,"Week Recap: The stock market closed higher. Labor market grow slow. A rate cut is almost certain, but recession concerns are rising. September 1, 2025 – September 5, 2025","First of all, I don't want to be misunderstood. This heat map is weekly that it visualized via closing prices from August 29 to September 5.

Tariff uncertainty and Trump's attacks on Powell is our regular agenda. In addition, we will hear to more recession concerns again due to labor market grow slow.

📊 Here are the S&amp;P 500's week-by-week results for the last 4 week,

August 8 close at 6,389.45 - August 15 close at 6,449.79 🟢 (0.94%)

August 29 close at 6,460.27 - September 5 close at 6,481.52 🟢 (+0.33%)

🔸 Monday: Holiday.

🔸 Tuesday: After the 3-day holiday, the stock market damaged as U.S. had to refund tariff money and opened lower than 1%. 30-Year Treasury Yield hit 5% again. Trump said that stock markets down today because it needs the tariffs. The stock market closed lower and September started with losing. 🔴

🔸 Wednesday: Fed meeting is approaching and Fed's Waller said we should cut at next meeting. Trump said need an early decision from supreme court on tariffs and stock market goes down because of uncertainty. The stock market opened higher. Google avoids worst-case penalties in antitrust case and the stock jumped more than 8%. This lifted the market. Nasdaq gained nearly 1% and the stock market closed higher. 🟢

🔸 Thursday: Before the session, ADP Employment Changes came in below expectations, but it is still positive. Continuing Jobless Claims came at 1,940K. I think, it's good sign below 2,000K because Fed will start rate cut, but it should be from inflation. Labor market grow slow. The stock market opened slightly higher. The session was quiet, but S&amp;P 500 closed a new all-time high at 6,502.08. 🟢

🔸 Friday: Before the session, Nonfarm Payrolls came in below expectations, but it's positive like ADP Employment Changes. U.S. added 22,000 Jobs in August. The stock market opened higher, but high volatility was here. Trump continued to attack Powell and said that as usual, he's to late. The stock market lost gains and closed lower. 🔴

Rate cut in September is almost certain. Moreover, the probability of 25 point rate cut is 89% and the probability of 50 point rate cut is 11% in CME FedWatch Tool. The are three more meetings left until end of the year and all of them expecting rate cut. However, a new concern is arrived again. The Core PCE inflation is steady at around 2.9%. If Fed cuts interest rate due to job market, recession fears could come with selling. We don't need to panic for now, but this risk must keep in mind.

# Why does the market still underestimate MU?

* The “RAM is cyclical” narrative still lingers, even among seasoned investors.
* Many still anchor MU to a short-cycle, commoditized trade, despite structural AI demand extending memory cycles.
* Meanwhile, earnings are exploding, and the DRAM/HBM cycle is becoming longer and indispensable.

# The AI Backbone

* Data centers and AI cannot exist without memory.
* MU is the only U.S. producer of HBM3e, delivering the highest quality modules - a critical material for AI data centers.
* Samsung makes DRAM too, but in its flagship Galaxy S25 phones it relies on… Micron memory.
* Micron also unveiled a portfolio of new AI-focused SSDs for data centers:

\- 9650 SSD - world’s first PCIe Gen6 drive, ultra-fast (28 GB/s read, 14 GB/s write), optimized for AI workloads.

\- 6600 ION SSD - up to 245 TB capacity, ultra-efficient, perfect for AI hyperscalers.

* The company is also developing radiation-tolerant SLC NAND - the first of its kind, certified for military and NASA standards.

# What’s changing?

* Coverage in the press is clearly improving.
* Analysts and ETFs, who this year pumped PLTR and other meme stories, are now late to recognize MU.
* MU is starting to be seen for what it truly is: the backbone of AI.
* And importantly, MU is **capturing more market share** in HBM and advanced memory -securing new customers and ramping capacity in 2025.

# The Numbers

* Forward P/E \~9-11 - far below most AI names.
* EPS approaching \~$12, gross margin \~42%.
* Market conviction is rising: the memory cycle is lasting longer and has become critical for AI and data centers.

# Why did others get the hype first?

* Media, ETFs, and analysts this year inflated PLTR during the AI hype mania.
* MU was recognized only later - undervalued, low-key, but with real products and clear technological advantages.
* Government contracts are a natural fit - radiation-tolerant memory is exactly what defense and space agencies need.

# Outlook

* Short-term pullbacks possible (profit-taking, earnings expectations).
* But long-term re-rating looks inevitable

**Valuation outlook (based on 2026 EPS forecast \~12 USD)**

P/E 15 -&gt; 12 × 15 = **$180**

P/E 20 -&gt; 12 × 20 = **$240**

P/E 25 -&gt;12 × 25 = **$300**

* For now: **real products, real sales, real markets** \- unlike hype-driven fantasies.

# Advantages

* **Only U.S. producer of HBM3e** \- strategic supplier for NVIDIA H200 and future AI accelerators.
* **AI-optimized SSD portfolio** \- world’s first PCIe Gen6 SSD (9650) and massive 245TB ION SSD for hyperscalers.
* **Radiation-tolerant memory** \- first space-qualified NAND/DRAM portfolio, certified for NASA and defense.
* **Adopted by competitors** \- Samsung uses Micron memory in its Galaxy S25 flagship phones.
* **Diversified portfolio** \- DRAM, NAND, NOR, HBM, and space-grade memory all under one roof.
* **U.S. fabs** \- Boise (Idaho) and New York expansions give Micron a secure domestic supply chain edge.
* **SK hynix currently leads in HBM** market share, and Samsung is pushing capacity – **but** Micron is rapidly gaining share and remains the only U.S.-based HBM supplier. This gives MU a strategic edge, especially with U.S. fabs reducing 100% exposure to potential tariff shocks.
* Micron isn’t just gaining share in HBM - it’s also expanding capacity with **strong U.S. government backing**. In 2025, Micron announced \~$150B in domestic memory manufacturing investments and $50B in R&amp;D, supported by the Trump administration. This reduces dependency on Asia and strengthens MU’s position as the only U.S.-based HBM supplier.

**How does Micron stack up against its rivals?**  
Here’s how MU compares with SK hynix and Samsung - and where its unique edge comes from:

# Competition &amp; Edge

* **Where rivals lead** **SK hynix currently leads in HBM**, with Samsung rapidly scaling capacity for next-gen parts. Both remain key suppliers to NVIDIA today.
* **Where Micron is catching up** but Micron is rapidly adding HBM customers and aims to lift share through 2025 -TrendForce reports Micron has secured four major GPU/ASIC clients and is targeting \~24% DRAM share by year-end, from a lower base.
* **Only U.S.-based HBM supplier** That unique footprint matters for AI data centers and government buyers. Micron’s HBM3e has been in volume production for NVIDIA’s H200 since 2024, with 8-high shipping and 12-high sampling at &gt;9.2 Gbps pin speed.
* **Storage edge for AI** Micron isn’t just DRAM/HBM - it’s pushing the I/O bottleneck: the **9650** is the first **PCIe Gen6** data-center SSD (up to \~28 GB/s), while **6600 ION** lines up ultra-high capacity to **122 TB now** and **245 TB** on the roadmap. That combo pairs well with AI training/inference pipelines.
* **U.S. fabs and policy tailwind** In 2025 Micron announced an expanded **$200B U.S. investment plan** ($150B manufacturing + $50B R&amp;D) in coordination with the administration - new capacity in Idaho and New York and advanced HBM packaging reduce single-region exposure and help mitigate tariff/geo shocks.
* **Tech roadmap nuance** Rivals are shifting HBM base-die production to foundry flows starting with HBM4 to address thermals and power. Reports say Micron may keep DRAM-process base dies through HBM4 and move with HBM4e - a watch-item that could influence competitive positioning.

**Bottom line:** **SK hynix leads today**, Samsung is scaling, but Micron’s U.S. base, accelerating HBM customer wins, and AI-focused SSD lineup give it a differentiated edge heading into 2025-26 - with policy-backed capacity expanding at home.

# Risks

* China retaliation - Beijing already restricted Micron products in critical infrastructure (2023); more tariffs or bans could cut into demand.
* Trade tariffs / Trump policies - new tariffs on materials and equipment from Asia could increase production costs, even if they also weaken Samsung/SK hynix in the U.S. market.
* Geopolitical exposure - escalation around Taiwan or Korea could disrupt supply chains globally, affecting MU’s inputs and logistics.
* Perception of a short-cycle commodity - despite structural AI demand, many investors and ETFs still treat memory as if it were a quick-turn, commoditized trade.
* Hyperscaler concentration - sales heavily tied to a handful of customers (NVIDIA, Amazon, Microsoft, Google). Any slowdown in hyperscaler CapEx would hit MU directly. This risk is not unique to Micron, but concentration makes revenue swings more visible

# The conclusion

Micron doesn’t need hype.  
It’s a fundamentally strong company, undervalued relative to EPS growth and forward guidance.  
Yes, there will be corrections and dips along the way. But the road to **$200\* and beyond** remains.  
\* *(Based on 2025 avg. EPS estimate of $8.06 x P/E multiple of 25 = $202 fair value target.)*

Micron is the **quiet but solid leader of AI infrastructure**. No memes, no empty headlines - just real products, rising demand, and technological edge, from data centers all the way to outer space.

**Year-to-date growth comparison (as of Sept 2025)**

|Company|YTD (%)|Comment|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**MU**|**+55%**|Fundamentals, AI SSDs, HBM3e, space-grade memory|
|**PLTR**|**+101%**|Hype, meme-driven, weak EPS|

268,NVDA,Are we in an AI bubble? Theory of micro-bursts,"Everyone and their dog is calling AI a bubble. When your Uber driver starts comparing NVDA to Cisco circa 1999, you know the ""bubble"" narrative has gone mainstream. But here's the thing - a bubble that everyone sees coming isn't really a bubble.

## We're still in the picks-and-shovels phase

Look at where the money's actually flowing - it's not into revolutionary AI products, it's into GPUs, data centers, and power infrastructure. We're basically in 1997 building out the internet's backbone. The real question isn't whether AI is overhyped (it is), but whether the infrastructure play has legs. History suggests it does.

But the next 2-3 years will be make-or-break for the monetization story. Either AI starts generating real revenue streams beyond ""we added a chatbot to our app"" or we're in for a reckoning.

## The bullshit-to-reality ratio is off the charts

Every non-technical analyst is suddenly an AI expert, and every AI CEO is promising AGI by next Tuesday. Remember when Anthropic's CEO said 90% of code would be AI-written within 6 months? That was 6 months ago. Meanwhile, AI customer service is still a dumpster fire, and most ""AI features"" are solutions looking for problems.

But here's what's actually happening under the noise: AI is quietly eating away at the edges of white-collar work. Not the dramatic ""AI replaces all programmers"" narrative, but more like ""tasks that took an hour of googling now take 5 minutes with ChatGPT."" It works maybe 9 times out of 10, which is good enough to justify layoffs in content mills, basic data entry, and first-level support roles.

## The micro-burst thesis

Forget the single massive bubble pop. The AI trade will be death by a thousand cuts - or wealth by a thousand rallies. Every earnings season becomes a referendum on AI adoption. Company misses AI targets? -15% in a day. Competitor shows actual AI revenue? +20% the next week.

This volatility is a feature, not a bug. The market's trying to price something that nobody really understands yet, in small and cautious steps.

## Macro resilience through dependency

The beauty of the US AI infrastructure play is that the entire world is becoming dependent on it. Even if the US gets hit with recession, trade wars, or whatever chaos comes next, the rest of the world still needs American AI compute. It's the new oil, except America is the only one with refineries.

Sure, ETF flows might create short-term correlation with broader market dumps, but AI infrastructure will likely lead any recovery. Where else is global capital going to go? European AI? Chinese models trained on censored data?

## The uncomfortable truth

This is America's game to lose. The combination of AI dominance and political tailwinds (regardless of your politics, deregulation = higher margins) creates a perfect storm for equity holders. The wealth gap will get uglier, but that's a policy problem, not a portfolio problem.

So, position accordingly. The AI revolution won't be televised - it'll be priced in quarterly increments.

97,NVDA,It's time for Broadcom to replace Tesla in the Mag 7,"After the most recent earnings report yesterday, including outstanding guidance, it's clear that Broadcom needs to be added to the Mag 8. Or even replace Tesla in the Mag 7.

With respect to net income (first graph), Broadcom still lags Nvidia, Apple, and the four hyperscalers. However, it generated $18.9 billion in net income last year to Tesla's $5.8 billion. While both are given rich valuations (P/E ratios of 122 and 208), Broadcom's income streams are projected to grow exponentially while Tesla's have been contracting; while Tesla is projected to turn a corner, but unlike the other Mag companies, they consistently miss on street expectations, even as these expectations constantly get guided down.

As far as price action, Tesla richly awarded its shareholders many years ago. But since being added to the S&amp;P 500 nearly five years ago (second graph), it has severely lagged the broader index and trails all of its peers except for Amazon. Meanwhile, Broadcom has consistently rewarded its shareholders with nearly 7x returns in less than five years, handily trouncing all of the Mag 8 peers except for Nvidia.

How about for year-to-date? Again (third graph), Broadcom is the leader at +32.66% YTD. Tesla brings up the rear at -10.74%.

Like Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta, Broadcom is also a high margin tech company that fits the AI theme, with Apple also now making an entry into this space. Tesla is a low-margin automotive company with a high margin energy credits division and a highly speculative robotics play.",388,47,1757110054.0,2025-09-05T22:07:34+00:00,t3_1n9ijrj,StockMarket

73,NVDA,"2 years ago I had asked about AI's impact on storage stocks like STX, WD, etc. Is it AI's impact or something else as STX is up 3x since ?","Is it attributable to AI's impact or this is normal cyclical effect ? Can experts in storage industry weigh in ?

Last time top comments suggested other storage providers over STX &amp; WD. But since then, 

STX up 3x

WD up 2x.

If not direct demand for their products, is this an indirect demand ?

Do you believe it will last longer like in 2030s ? Or this will be gone by then ? What is your hypothesis ?

AI depends on data. This data will need to be stored somewhere. Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) do most of the storing of world's data currently. SSDs (solid state/flash) carry the rest of the data.

[https://blocksandfiles.com/2022/05/16/monday-gartner-hdd-ssd-numberfest/](https://blocksandfiles.com/2022/05/16/monday-gartner-hdd-ssd-numberfest/)

Will AI need more HDD or SSD ? Or both and hence demand for both will go up ?

There are only few (like 3/4 ?) manufacturers of storage. STX, WD, Toshiba being the major ones. While their recent quarter revenues haven't yet shown any large demand related to AI and revenues haven't shown increase like that in NVDA revenue, wouldn't in the future they will have more AI driven demand ? like multiple times of current demand ?

If yes, how come these stocks are down ? recent revenues were down but isn't that like ignoring the potential demand from AI requirements ?

Or will AI become smart enough (learn using existing data) to require not much additional storage and thus there won't be much demand growth due to AI for storage?

99,NVDA,IBM : why the stock is sleeping ?,"Hi everyone,

I've been following IBM since I'm looking to add some quantum technology to my portfolio. While doing my research, I came across a ton of stock market articles promising 20x returns if you bet on IONQ and others... But instead of relying on questionable articles, I preferred to dig into the technology itself. It's clear that quantum computing technology is fascinating. It offers unimaginable computing power, but unfortunately, we're still far from mastering it. However, there are companies working hard to one day achieve a truly stable system. And when I read scientific articles, one company stands out: IBM.

For those born before 2000, IBM probably brings to mind old computer ads without really knowing what they were selling, and it seemed to vanish from the spotlight overnight... Yet, IBM has continued to deliver excellent results, and its research achievements remain impressive.

That said, let’s move from the real world to the stock market. Here, I find that IBM is a stock that, yes, is growing, but far behind the rest of the tech sector. After its excellent results, the stock price took a significant hit.

This brings me to a problem I often encounter in the stock market: a good company but a bad stock. It reminds me of Arista, which was held back by rumors of competition with Nvidia, only to finally break out after excellent results and confirmed guidance. But IBM feels worse, it’s like no one cares about it.

95,NVDA,Info regarding Nvidia,"Cantor Fitzgerald analysts highlight AI as “the only meaningful growth driver” for chip stocks amid geopolitical and economic uncertainty.

Despite reports of AI adoption challenges in China and elsewhere, analysts see these as temporary, noting hyperscale cloud providers (MSFT , META , GOOGL , GOOG , AMZN ) are increasing capital expenditures sharply (57% this year, 20% in 2026).

AMD’s data-center GPUs and Instinct AI accelerators show strong growth, with EPS near $4 (FactSet $3.85), while AI inference and rack-scale solutions signal further expansion across the AI ecosystem.

100,NVDA,Downside Risk Is Building Everywhere,"The market is facing 3 issues: commercial delinquency rates, EV tax credit, and an AI Bubble.   
  
Commercial real estate is screaming a crisis. Office delinquency rates just hit 11.7%, worse than 2008’s peak of 10.7%. Multifamily isn’t far behind at 6.9%. That means banks and credit markets are sitting on toxic exposure that can’t just be papered over. This isn’t a “low fuel” warning light; the tank is empty. The system is already running on fumes.

The auto sector faces its own cliff. Federal EV tax credits ($7,500 new, $4,000 used) expire September 30. Sales have been artificially front-loaded. July used EV sales hit nearly 37,000, a record. But that’s demand pulled forward, not organic growth. After September, the floor drops out. Automakers and suppliers will hit a wall in Q4 as incentives vanish.

And the supposed engine of the market, AI, is showing cracks. Nvidia’s growth slowed from +69% to +53% YoY, and an MIT study found 95% of AI projects fail to deliver results. Yet NVDA still trades at \~45x forward earnings, alongside other megacap tech priced like it’s 1999 again. Every major AI company that reports earnings risks popping the bubble, and right now, institutions are most likely delaying the inevitable to save their positions and hand them off to dumb money before the music stops.

TLDR: From CRE delinquencies to the EV demand cliff to the overinflated AI trade, the market isn’t “fueling up for more upside.” It’s running on fumes. September through Q4 looks bearish, with downside risk in banks, autos, and megacap tech.

09:26am EDT, 09/02/2025","**(Tuesday market open)** Treasury yields and volatility spiked while tech stocks slumped to start the short week after a court decision ruled most of President Trump's tariffs illegal. The tariffs remain in place on appeal, but the news has markets on edge, judging by global yield climbs. Seasonal trends also came into play, with September traditionally Wall Street's worst month and a strong earnings season virtually over.

**Salesforce** (CRM) and **Broadcom** (AVGO) earnings tomorrow and Thursday keep tech in view as the sector appeared to stumble. Broadcom might shed more light on AI demand after results from **Dell** (DELL) and **Marvell** (MRVL) last week triggered anxiety. Industry leader Nvidia (NVDA) fell more than 3% Friday and is down again this morning, hurt partly by those two earnings reports and by a *Wall Street Journal* article about a new AI chip developed by Chinese firm **Alibaba** (BABA). Some of today's shakiness also could reflect trepidation approaching Friday's August **nonfarm payrolls** report. Analysts expect more weakness with just 78,000 jobs added. Data today include a look at U.S. manufacturing health.

Major indexes retreated from recent record highs last Friday as **Personal Consumption Expenditures** (PCE) price data reinforced ideas that inflation remains sticky. Odds of a rate cut this month remain above 90%, according to the **CME FedWatch Tool**. ""We expect the Fed to cut twice this year,"" said Cooper Howard, director, fixed income strategy at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. Risk-off trading dominated late last week with energy, consumer staples, and health care among the leaders and info tech and consumer discretionary weaker. Still, August was the fourth straight positive month for the **S&amp;P 500 index**, which rose 1.91%. The Nasdaq added 1.58%.

**Three things to watch**

**Software earnings hint at rebound with Salesforce ahead:** Investors will closely watch a slate of software companies set to report earnings this week after better-than-expected results from **Snowflake** (SNOW) and other industry firms last week defied a broader slump in the sector. Snowflake and **MongoDB** (MDB) both spiked after reporting solid revenue growth. **MongoDB** said it's added more than 5,000 customers year to date, a record amid growing demand from large firms building AI applications. Results clashed with a trend of underperformance in the software sector. Shares of giants like **Salesforce** (CRM) and **Adobe** (ADBE) have dropped significantly in 2025, even with the **Nasdaq Composite** up more than 10%. Shares of giants like **Salesforce** (CRM) and **Adobe** (ADBE) have dropped significantly in 2025, even with the **Nasdaq Composite** up more than 10%. This week, investors get more insight from software leaders, headlined by **Salesforce** on Wednesday. **Broadcom** (AVGO), which derives nearly half its revenue from software sales, will report Thursday.

Congress back in town with a deadline: Senators and representatives return to Washington today following a summer break. The top priority will be government funding, which expires September 30. Legislators will need to pass the 12 appropriations bills that fund every government agency and program by then. ""Congress is no where near doing that, and that means there is a risk of a government shutdown at the end of September,” said Michael Townsend, managing director of legislative and regulatory affairs at Schwab. ""Historically, government shutdowns have not been big market movers, in fact, the market has gone up in the last five government shutdowns. But it would add yet another element of uncertainty that markets will have to consider."" Under a nearer-term Washington microscope: This week's **Senate Banking Committee** confirmation hearing for Stephen Miran, Trump's nominee to fill a Fed vacancy. This could bring more drama than usual after Trump attempted for fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook last week, raising concerns about Fed independence.

**Positive trend persists despite today's weakness: Technically**, markets held up relatively well last week and the momentum-signaling **Relative Strength Index (RSI)** for the **S&amp;P 500 index** finished Friday above 58, a constructive reading, though down a bit from the August peak near 68. Breadth remained constructive last week, as well, but volatility as measured by the **Cboe Volatility Index** (VIX) spiked today, interrupting what had been a subdued hedging environment. So-called ""risk-on"" sectors led in August with strong showings from communication services, materials, financials, and consumer discretionary stocks. Info tech had a mild month, rising less than 0.3%. And the **S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Index** (SPXEW), which weighs all stocks the same rather than by market capitalization, outpaced the **S&amp;P 500 index** for the first time in four months, a sign of broader strength beyond the mega caps.

**On the move**

* Tech leaders **Nvidia** (NVDA) and **Palantir** (PLTR) fell early Tuesday amid a general pullback in risk-on trading that appeared to spill over from Friday. Nvidia tumbled 2.4% and is now down nearly 8% from recent all-time highs recorded before last week's earnings report, which came in generally as expected but didn't set off any fireworks. Palantir fell 3.5% this morning and is down almost 18% from last month's peak.  
* **Bitcoin futures** (/BTC) dropped nearly 4% Friday and ended August down 7.6% for the month despite hitting an all-time high on August 14. Futures rebounded slightly early today. **Coinbase** (COIN) both dropped 1% Friday but **Circle Internet Group** (CRCL) managed a light gain.  
* **Signet Jewelers** (SIG) shares shined today, up 3.4% as investors reacted to solid earnings. The company also raised earnings guidance for the fiscal year.  
* **Meta Platforms** (META) fell 1.7% after Reuters reported the company removed several celebrity AI chatbots after using celebrity voices and images without permission.  
* **Block** (XYZ) fell 3.1% as BNP Paribas downgraded shares to Hold from Buy.  
* **Tesla** (TSLA) fell 2% ahead of the open after a 4% drop in August sales in China, Reuters reported.  
* **PepsiCo** (PEP) popped nearly 5% today as the *Wall Street Journal* reported that activist investor Elliott Investment Management has built a roughly $4 billion stake in the company.  
* **Newmont** (NMT) climbed 1% early Tuesday, helped by global uncertainty and rate cut hopes that continue to support gold prices.  
* **Crude oil** rose 2.3% early Tuesday amid increased concerns around the war in Ukraine and ahead of this coming weekend's OPEC meeting. Analysts expect no production changes from the meeting, CNBC reported.  
* **Marvell Technology** plunged double digits Friday and another 2.6% today after second quarter data center revenue rose 69% but missed analysts' consensus. Earnings per share and revenue were in line with expectations, and guidance also was near consensus views. Shares had already fallen 30% this year before the latest drop.  
* **Dell Technologies** dropped nearly 9% Friday despite quarterly results that topped Wall Street's estimates and reflected strong growth in its AI server business. It also raised its full-year outlook. But guidance for third quarter earnings per share fell short of consensus.  
* The **Russell 2000\*\*\*\*****^(®)** **Index** (RUT) of smaller stocks outpaced other major indexes with a nearly 7% rise in August as rate cut odds supported a move into smaller names.

Since May, net portfolio flows into Asia have turned positive, indicating improving investor sentiment and renewed capital inflows into the region.

The trend of capital returning to Asia is closely correlated with the continued weakening of the dollar (as reflected by the decline in the nominal Emerging Market U.S. Dollar Index), suggesting that a softer dollar is a key factor driving inflows.

Non-China emerging Asian economies contributed significantly to the inflows, while capital flows into China also improved during the same period.

104,NVDA,NVDA | NVIDIA Last 5 Years + Next 5 Years,"NVIDIA CEO Jen-Hsun Huang lays it out clearly in his conference call remarks. Based on his comments, I expect the company to generate 40% to 50% revenue growth for the next few years. Beyond GPU and Networking Silicon, in the future, I believe NVIDIA will enter A.I. software infrastructure services, offering full system and application support for the largest compute customers in the world, both CSP and Enterprise, as well as Sovereign investors.\* (see below)

I am long NVDA and AMD.

**Key Nuggets from CEO in Last 3 Conference Calls:**

**FQ4 2025 (Feb. 26, 2025):**

""There are now multiple scaling laws. There is the **pre-training scaling law**, and that is going to continue to scale because we have multimodality, we have data that came from reasoning that are now used to do pretraining. And then the second is **post-training scaling law**, using reinforcement learning human feedback, reinforcement learning AI feedback, reinforcement learning, verifiable rewards. The amount of computation you use for post training is actually higher than pretraining. And it is kind of sensible in the sense that you could, while you are using reinforcement learning, generate an enormous amount of synthetic data or synthetically generated tokens. AI models are basically generating tokens to train AI models. And that's post training. And the third part, this is the part that you mentioned is **test time computation or reasoning, long thinking, inference scaling**. They are all basically the same ideas. And there you have a chain of thought, you have searched. The amount of tokens generated and the amount of inference compute needed is already 100x more than the one-shot examples and the one-shot capabilities of large language models in the beginning. And that is just the beginning. This is just the beginning. The idea that the next generation could have thousands of times and even hopefully, extremely thoughtful and simulation-based and search-based models that could be hundreds of thousands, millions of times more compute than today is in our future.""

**FQ1 2026 (May 28, 2025):**

**""Grace Blackwell NVLink72 is the ideal engine today, the ideal computer thinking machine, if you will, for reasoning AI. There's a couple of reasons for that. The first reason is that the token generation amount, the number of tokens reasoning goes through, is 100 times, 1,000 times more than a one-shot chatbot. It's essentially thinking to itself, breaking down a problem step-by-step. It might be planning multiple paths to an answer. It could be using tools, reading PDFs, reading web pages, watching videos, and then producing a result, an answer. The longer it thinks,** **the better the answer**, **the smarter the answer is**. And so, what we would like to do, and the reason why Grace Blackwell was designed to give such a giant step-up in inference performance, is so that you could do all this and still get a response as quickly as possible. **Compared to Hopper, Grace Blackwell is some 40 times higher speed and throughput compared.** And so, this is going to be a huge, huge benefit in driving down the cost while improving the quality of response with excellent quality of service at the same time. So, that's the fundamental reason. That was the core driving reason for Grace Blackwell NVLink72. Of course, in order to do that, we had to reinvent, literally redesign the entire way that these supercomputers are built, and -- but now we're in full production. It's going to be exciting. It's going to be incredibly exciting.""

**FQ2 2025 (August 27, 2025):**

""And so we are really an AI infrastructure company, and we are hoping to continue to contribute to growing this industry, making AI more useful and then very importantly, driving the performance per watt because the world, as you mentioned, limiters, it will always likely be power limitations or AI -- building limitations. And so we need to squeeze as much out of that factory as possible. **NVIDIA's performance per unit of energy used drives the revenue growth of that factory.** It directly translates. If you have a 100- megawatt factory, performance per 100 megawatt drives your revenues. It is tokens per 100 megawatts of factory. In our case also, the performance per dollar spent is so high that your gross margins are also the best. But anyhow, these are the limiters going forward and $3 trillion to $4 trillion is fairly sensible for the next 5 years.""

133,NVDA,$MNDY DD in honor of Monday's Close,"I wrote this without the help of chatgpt for what its worth, but idk if that makes it better or worse. MNDY is a software as a service platform, you can go google the ins and outs of what they do because that isn't the focus here. The point is this stock took an absolute prison beating after its Q2 earnings because of slightly lower than expected Q3 guidance. Despite the fact they raised full year guidance and had +27% year over year revenue growth, the stock still took a 30% haricut.

I don't believe in technical analysis or colorful lines but since the drop, the stock has been bouncing off resistance at $180 until it broke through on Thursday. On Friday it continued up while the rest of the market and tech sector sold off. Nothing about the core business has changed and I believe the selloff was bigly overdone, so over the course of the next month or two we'll see a move back to the $270 range. Two upcoming catalysts will likely help with that, MNDY speaks at the Goldman Sachs conference Sep 10th, and they're hosting the 2025 Elevate conference in NYC on Sep 17th-18th. Goldman Sachs maintains a BUY rating and $270 PT on the stock, and I expect we'll get more information about the AI hyped digital workers and product powerups the company has been teasing during Elevate.

Also Congressman Bresnahan, the guy who said he'd ban trading in congress, bought MNDY twice this year alongside his other tech purchases NVDA and SNOW.

134,NVDA,September,"Will we see the September Effect this year.  Historically it’s a bad month especially after a run up after summer.  I think it’ll be a volatile month for the following reasons:

Profit taking after traders return from vacation and starting with low volume trading leading to rebalancing portfolios.  

AI although high growth potential - it may be over extended and top heavy leaning towards a pull back.  Growth in this area has been concentrated towards big tech, and potentially over capacity with China jumping in.  NVDA has held up well, but sales aboard could slow due to international growth in this area.  

Clean up for fund portfolios selling off the losers to rebalance and realized tax lost.  

Lastly the everybody is aware of the effect and could lead to selling hoping to get back in mid November.

I loaded up on UVIX calls.  They are a bargain currently.  I think we’ll see a lot of volatility this season.

333,NVDA,"Nvidia’s top 2 mystery customers made 39% of Q2 revenue, up from 25% last year, raising concentration risk concerns","No paywall: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/28/nvidias-top-two-mystery-customers-made-up-39percent-of-its-q2-revenue-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/28/nvidias-top-two-mystery-customers-made-up-39percent-of-its-q2-revenue-.html)

Two Nvidia customers made up 39% of Nvidia’s revenue in its July quarter, the company revealed in a financial filing on Wednesday, raising concerns about the concentration of the chipmaker’s clientele.

“Customer A” made up 23% of total revenue, and “Customer B” comprised 16% of total revenue, according to the company’s second-quarter filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

That’s higher than the same quarter a year ago when Nvidia’s top two customers made up 14% and 11% of sales, according to the filing.

The company regularly publishes information on a quarterly basis about its top customers, but the disclosure this week is fueling a renewed debate about whether Nvidia’s explosive growth is being driven by a handful of large cloud providers such as Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Oracle.

Nvidia finance chief Colette Kress said in a Wednesday statement that “large cloud service providers” made up about 50% of the company’s data center revenue. That’s important as the data center business made up 88% of Nvidia’s overall revenue in the second quarter.

“We have experienced periods where we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers, and this trend may continue,” Nvidia wrote in the filing.

Increasingly, analysts are looking to those cloud capital expenditure spending commitments to model the future growth of Nvidia.

“We see limited room for further earnings upside revision or share price catalyst in the near-term unless we have increasing clarity over upside in 2026 \[cloud service provider\] capex expectations,” wrote HSBC analyst Frank Lee in a note on Thursday. He has a hold rating on the stock.

But Nvidia’s Customer A and Customer B are not necessarily cloud providers. It’s a bit of a mystery, and an Nvidia representative declined to share the identities of Customer A and Customer B.

In its filing, Nvidia says it has both “direct customers” and “indirect customers.” Customer A and Customer B are listed as “direct customers.”

Direct customers are not the end users of Nvidia’s chips. They’re companies that buy the chips to build into complete systems or circuit boards that they then sell to data centers, cloud providers and end-users. Some of these direct customers are original design manufacturers or original equipment manufacturers like Foxconn or Quanta. Others are distributors or system integrators like Dell.

Indirect customers, meanwhile, include cloud service providers, internet companies and enterprises, which typically buy systems from Nvidia’s direct customers. Nvidia says it can only estimate revenue to indirect customers based on purchase orders and internal sales data.

Deciphering if any of those cloud providers are Nvidia’s mystery customers is difficult, in part because the chipmaker has wiggle room in the definitions of its direct and indirect customers.

Nvidia, for example, wrote in the filing that some direct customers buy chips to build systems for their own use.

Additionally, Nvidia noted that two of its indirect customers each accounted for over 10% of its total revenue, primarily buying systems through Customers A and B.

Contributing further to the mystery of it all, Nvidia said that an “AI research and development company” contributed a “meaningful” amount of revenue through both direct and indirect customers.

Nvidia told investors on Wednesday that demand for the company’s AI systems remains high, not just among cloud providers, but among other kinds of customers, including enterprises buying systems for AI and “neoclouds,” which are companies that are taking on the biggest providers with services more tuned for AI. Nvidia also listed foreign governments, saying it would record $20 billion in revenue this year for “sovereign AI.” All of these product categories are contributing to Nvidia’s revenue growth, Kress told analysts on an earnings call.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang also said that the company has a new forecast of $3 to $4 trillion in AI infrastructure by the end of the decade. It said that it could take about 70% of the total cost of a $50 billion AI-focused data center, not just for its graphics processing units but for other chips it sells, too.

Huang told investors it was a sensible target for the next five years because of how much hyperscalers were spending and committing to spend — $600 billion this year, according to Huang. He also said new kinds of customers, such as enterprises or overseas cloud providers, were joining the build-out.

“As you know, the capex of just the top four hyperscalers has doubled in two years as the AI revolution went into full steam,” Huang said.",1623,258,1756652296.0,2025-08-31T14:58:16+00:00,t3_1n4wvy8,wallstreetbets
370,NVDA,Do you believe Quantum  computing will be the next big thing in 20 years,"You know how everyone looks back and thinks, (I should have bought NVIDIA in 2015)? Back then, it was just a company making graphics cards. Nobody really saw it becoming one of the biggest companies in the world, driving AI  and data centers. It’s easy to see in hindsight, but at the time, it just didn’t look that big.

Now imagine quantum computing in the same way. In 20 years, it could change how we do medicine, energy, finance, and even security. The companies that end up leading this space could be the next NVIDIA.

I know, this titles looks so random and bland because lot of people will answer ""we don't know, we can't predict the futur"".

In France, we have some financial media like tv show or newspapper about stockmarket. And during one of tv show, they asked to fund managers which company could be the next big one, the next GAFAM. And during the talking, no one could't answer and give a name because no one got a product which will be the new pillar of the economy, except one. For one of them, one could be the next GAFAM : Coreweave. At the moment, he knows the company need more and more debt to develop the business, but because they are very focus to be a giant of AI sector. But for him, Coreweave will be the next GAFAM. The only issue for him is the big loss at every earning. But when the company become a cash machine, that could be a monster.

  
I think today, there is a big placeat the top for a company which can make the link between Nvidia and traditionnal companies. Maybe like Hyperscaler owner or even in global solution software.

371,NVDA,I want to talk about Nvidia stocks a little bit.,"Nvidia's earnings call was on Wednesday. And to be honest I was quite surprised by the numbers.

46 billion USD in revenue per quarter. And 42.1 billion of it purely from datacenters related business. I.e. selling GPUs primarily. I know they sell NICs and other stuff too. But a big chunk of that money came from GPUs. And that was for a single quarter. Not even 1 whole year.

To put that 46 billion USD number into perspective. Twitter placed an order 100K H100 GPUs one year ago if I remember correctly. 100K x 25K(per GPU) \~= 2.5 billion USD. And that itself was a giant order. And once you spend 2.5 billion dollars on GPUs, there is no chance in hell the company will turn around and buy more GPUs for another 2 to 3 years. Unless the next generation of GPUs show such tremendous performance improvement that they are compelled to buy more GPUs. And let's be honest this is not 1970s that processors can be optimized that much in a year or 2. GPUs are reaching a saturation point in my opinion. Once you buy a light bulb you won't buy a new one unless the current one burns out.

There is a thermal upper limit to how many MOSFETs you can cram on a die. And even the MOSFETs themselves can only be shrunk so much. 4nm feature size MOSFET is an incredibly small MOSFET. An atom itself is like 0.1nm. The MOSFETs we are making today barely have 2000 or so atoms in them if I am not wrong. All of these conclusions arise from Moore's law dying a slow death.

Better architecture is the way these processor manufacturers were able to eek out more performance gains without a die shrink. But at this point we are looking at a 25 year old processor manufacturing company. Whatever trivial optimizations they could make to their GPUs have already been made in my opinion.

In-spite of all of this, these people are selling about 1.68 million H100 equivalents every quarter? And not only that, the next quarter's guidance is about 13% higher than this quarter! And people have priced that into the stock price already. Their PE is about 50! Their stock holders are willing to pay 50 times the annual profit the company makes. And if the company doesn't make that much profit, i.e. sell about roughly 1.9 million H100s next quarter or whatever is the latest high performance GPU, their stock will crash.

I think the biggest bubble in the market right now is Nvidia. People have milked the Nvidia cow to the maximum limit.",91,136,1756495842.0,2025-08-29T19:30:42+00:00,t3_1n3gv4a,stocks

76,NVDA,Alibaba unveils homegrown AI chip to replace Nvidia’s H20 in China,"No paywall: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chinas-alibaba-develops-ai-chip-090846681.html

(Reuters) -China's Alibaba has developed a new chip that is more versatile than its older chips and is meant to serve a broader range of AI inference tasks, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The chip, now in testing, is manufactured by a Chinese company, in contrast to an earlier Alibaba AI processor that was fabricated by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, the report said.

Alibaba did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Chinese tech and AI companies have been focusing heavily on homegrown technology at a time when leading AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) has faced regulatory issues in selling its products in the country.

Nvidia's H20 chip, the most powerful AI processor it is allowed to sell in China, was effectively blocked from sale in the market earlier this year by the Trump administration.

While the U.S. last month allowed Nvidia to resume sales of H20 to China, Chinese firms have been working on processors that could substitute H20. Beijing has also put pressure on tech giants, including Alibaba and ByteDance, over purchases of the H20 chip.

Nvidia developed the H20 specifically for China following U.S. export restrictions on its other AI processors in 2023. The H20 does not have as much computing power as Nvidia's H100 or its Blackwell series.

Alibaba is China's biggest cloud-computing company and is among the top customers of Nvidia.

98,NVDA,"Robots are cool, a DD","Richtech Robotics A Due Diligence

Currently trading at 3-3.2$ a share and I am convinced it will be trading above 100$ within a five to ten year time horizon.

Fundamentals and Overview Richtech defines their company mission as, “By harnessing the power of collaborative robotic solutions, Richtech is redefining the service industry landscape. Our mission is to drive a revolutionary automation of tasks, enhancing customer experiences, and enabling businesses to unlock their full potential.”

“Richtech Robotics partners with NVIDIA through the NVIDIA Connect program to integrate NVIDIA's AI and accelerated computing technologies, such as the Jetson Orin platform and Isaac Sim, into their service robots like Adam and Scorpion. This collaboration enhances Richtech's robots with improved body movement detection accuracy, faster development times through simulation, and more efficient navigation in complex environments. The partnership aims to accelerate Richtech's mission to make AI-driven service robots a common sight in industries such as hospitality, retail, and restaurants.” As we have seen over the last five to ten years, NVIDIA has become the industry leader in the AI and semiconductor market. With a market cap of over 4.4 trillion dollars, NVIDIA is positioned as the backbone of the technological landscape for the foreseeable future. Because of this, NVIDIA will be able to consistently supply Richtech with the most up to date technology for their line of robotics. Additionally, NVIDIA has a 50% voting share of the company so will be able to guide them financially as they make their transition from unprofitable to profitable.

Market Opportunity A majority of my positive sentiment comes from the FACT that low-skill jobs will be phased out of existence within a 10-20 year time horizon. I believe trade skills (electricians, mechanics, etc.) will be one of the few blue collar job markets that will survive the coming AI and tech revolution. However, back to low-skill jobs, I fully believe jobs like assembly line workers, fast food workers, cashiers, hostesses and waiters, taxi and uber drivers, and many more will become obsolete as robotics transition into becoming a cheaper labor option. Yes, I know a majority of robotics companies are in the very early trial phase, and many of the existing prototypes have not become fully functional. While that may be a bearish sign for the robotics market now, I believe it only provides RR with less barriers to entry in the coming years. As I said before, Richtech is financially backed by NVIDIA and operates on their platforms. This allows RR to put more focus into the development of their robotics as they have a 4.4 trillion dollar market giant lining their pockets.

Enough about NVIDIA, let’s continue to discuss RR’s market opportunity in the future. As consumer and commercial robotics transition into the global labor market, companies like Richtech have the opportunity to become the face of an entirely new industry. I really love this stock, and believe robotics poses a similar market opportunity to Apple in 2008. As we have seen with every form of new technology that comes out, initial reactions are typically all over the place, often siding towards skepticism.

Historical Examples Steve Ballmer (former CEO of Microsoft) said this, “There’s no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share. No chance.” Yeah okay bud, how did that turn out for you.

Or similarly, look at the public reaction to the current AI revolution (screenshot at top). This is not to say that there is always a bad reaction as new technology is released, just that the public often sides towards skepticism vs optimism. Robotics is currently the center of one of these optimism vs. skepticism debates in regards to its long term potential. This is why I believe now is the best buying opportunity for robotics and robotics stocks. This is a situation where we have the chance to buy that metaphorical iPhone at its release (i.e robotics). Don’t be a Steve Balmer, look beyond the next few years!

Technology and Software Richtech Robotics currently has seven operational robot models with a variety of functions.

Competitors/Current Market Landscape

Richtech Robotics is taking aim at the low skill job industry I spoke about earlier with their service industry robotics. Industry analysts point to a market with few pure-play automation names to lean on. Serve Robotics is one comparable, though it focuses more on autonomous delivery, while titans like ABB, Siemens, and Rockwell Automation dominate factory-floor automation Meanwhile, established robotics firms such as Intuitive Surgical shine in medical automation. At its core, Richtech’s competitive edge lies in its niche deployment in hospitality, health, and cleaning. I believe that these three industries could be some of the most affected by the upcoming robotic revolution. The company has already deployed over 300 robots across the U.S., blending proof-points with scale. RR is positioned to become the Apple, Google, Tesla of the robotics industry by 2030.

Future Potential

I fully believe to my core that Richtech stands on the brink of something big, even though the path might be a longer journey. The global retail automation market is projected to reach $25 billion by 2030, highlighting the magnitude of opportunity ahead. They recently signed two-year Master Services Agreement (with auto-renewal) with a major retailer signals a breakthrough in actual channel penetration and investor sentiment. For example, the stock soared 23% on that news alone. Add to that the Walmart ghost-kitchen deployments running Richtech robots in dozens of locations and the revenue potential becomes very tangible. These locations are each projected to pull in between $700,000 and $2 million annually. Pair this with Richtech’s 76% gross margin and strong solvency score (81/100), and you’ve got a company that isn’t just spending its cash left and right, it has a robust financial base to reinvest aggressively.

On the flip side, risks are real: analysts widely forecast price targets in the $2.50–$3.50 range, with an average near current levels. This implies modest to minimal short term upside. Freedom Broker recently downgraded RR to Sell, citing overvaluation and the need for more deliverables from its retailer partners before they’ll reconsider.

This poses a good buying opportunity for us. Many may still be thinking like Steve Balmer regarding the iPhone. Public perception still thinks robotics may be a fad or may never be able to “capture the market share.” All that aside, robotics has been framed as ""the next era"" by Nvidia’s CEO himself. So, Richtech is very much in the spotlight. Not only that, but its use of Nvidia’s scalable AI platform is an edge no current robotics competitor can replicate.

TL;DR

If you just want to read a paragraph, here you go:

Richtech Robotics (RR), trading at ~$3 today, backed by Nvidia, has seven operating service industry robots. Robotics has infinite market opportunities in retail, hospitality, and healthcare. I believe this is undeniably reminiscent of early-stage Apple circa 2008. Current verdict: strong margin profile, robust cash and solvency, tangible large-scale deployments en route. I believe that proof of consistent revenue execution is the crucial next step towards a robotics revolution. If you’re in for being a long-term investor, I have unwavering faith that RR could be the next Apple-like stock within the next 10-15 years.",11,3,1756478516.0,2025-08-29T14:41:56+00:00,t3_1n39ajh,SmallStreetBets

372,NVDA,Nvidia’s top two mystery customers made up 39% of the chipmaker’s Q2 revenue,"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/28/nvidias-top-two-mystery-customers-made-up-39percent-of-its-q2-revenue-.html

&gt; Two Nvidia customers made up 39% of Nvidia’s revenue in its July quarter, the company revealed in a financial filing on Wednesday, raising concerns about the concentration of the chipmaker’s clientele. “Customer A” made up 23% of total revenue, and “Customer B” comprised 16% of total revenue, according to the company’s second-quarter filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. That’s higher than the same quarter a year ago when Nvidia’s top two customers made up 14% and 11% of sales, according to the filing.

&gt; The company regularly publishes information on a quarterly basis about its top customers, but the disclosure this week is fueling a renewed debate about whether Nvidia’s explosive growth is being driven by a handful of large cloud providers such as Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Oracle. Nvidia finance chief Colette Kress said in a Wednesday statement that “large cloud service providers” made up about 50% of the company’s data center revenue. That’s important as the data center business made up 88% of Nvidia’s overall revenue in the second quarter. “We have experienced periods where we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers, and this trend may continue,” Nvidia wrote in the filing.

&gt; Increasingly, analysts are looking to those cloud capital expenditure spending commitments to model the future growth of Nvidia. “We see limited room for further earnings upside revision or share price catalyst in the near-term unless we have increasing clarity over upside in 2026 [cloud service provider] capex expectations,” wrote HSBC analyst Frank Lee in a note on Thursday. He has a hold rating on the stock. But Nvidia’s Customer A and Customer B are not necessarily cloud providers. It’s a bit of a mystery, and an Nvidia representative declined to share the identities of Customer A and Customer B.",957,168,1756413041.0,2025-08-28T20:30:41+00:00,t3_1n2ndkr,stocks

99,NVDA,The S&amp;P 500 is dominated by just 7 Mega-Cap stocks—But what aabout the overlooked AI plays?,"Here’s a data point worth pausing on: the 7 largest companies in the S&amp;P 500 now account for nearly one-third of the index’s total market value. This level of concentration is unprecedented.

Diversification used to be a cornerstone of investing. But now? If Apple, Microsoft, or Nvidia so much as “sneeze,” the entire market might “catch a cold.”

The key question is this: while everyone is piling into trillion-dollar AI giants, there’s an entire universe of smaller AI and smart technology companies being ignored. And that’s exactly where “asymmetric opportunities” (limited downside with massive upside potential) may be hiding.

One small-cap stock I’ve been watching is Maase Group ($MAAS). Unlike chipmakers vying for dominance, Maase is building an intelligent living ecosystem—its business spans AI-powered smart home solutions and even extends into financial services. In short, it’s focused on applying AI to everyday life.

In today’s “top-heavy” market structure, uncovering these off-index opportunities may not just be a smart move… it could be a necessary one.",4,1,1756374413.0,2025-08-28T09:46:53+00:00,t3_1n27w3e,SmallStreetBets

100,NVDA,My thoughts on some small-cap AI stocks,"Recently, I have looked into several small-sized companies in the AI sector. They operate in different niche segments, boasting certain structural flexibility and logical industry linkage, making them worth attention for those interested in tech trends.

**Astera Labs (ALAB)**

Focuses on AI data center interconnection technology. It is a core supply chain partner for clients like NVIDIA and Amazon, and is known as the ""underlying connector in the AI era.""

Reminder: Its valuation is relatively high, and market attention is concentrated. If its financial performance fails to meet expectations or the tech sector adjusts, price volatility may intensify.

**SoundHound AI (SOUN)**

Specializes in voice AI. Its products have been integrated into the systems of automakers such as Hyundai and Kia, and it has formed a certain ecological linkage with OpenAI. Its revenue has grown significantly in the past few quarters.

Reminder: It has a small scale and is still in the early stage of investment for profitability. The market is quite sensitive to its growth path, so it is necessary to dynamically monitor the progress of key collaborations and earnings guidance.

**Iris Energy (IREN)**

Covers both AI server deployment and computing infrastructure. It has a dual-driving logic of digital assets and high-performance computing, offering great room for development narratives.

Reminder: Its performance is significantly affected by industry cycles, especially reacting quickly to fluctuations in the Bitcoin or GPU markets. It is recommended to pay attention to the progress of its AI business in the revenue structure.

**Amprius Technologies (AMPX**)

Focuses on silicon anode battery solutions, targeting high-power consumption mobile platforms such as AI terminal devices and drones, and has leading advantages in technical parameters.

Reminder: It is still in the early stage of scaling up, with concentrated order sources. The pace of industrial chain expansion may bring phased adjustments to its valuation and development rhythm.

**MAASE Inc. (MAAS)**

Its intelligent unmanned car wash system integrates machine vision and IoT platforms to achieve highly reliable operations; its mobile charging robot network solves the pain points of new energy refueling; and it uses AIoT technology to manage scarce reference resources, injecting core momentum for intelligent upgrading into traditional big health and energy services, demonstrating strong application-layer integration capabilities.

Summary: These companies have topic appeal and certain technological advantages. However, they feature flexible structures, high price volatility, and sharp reactions to news. They are suitable for experienced investors to observe with a small position while conducting dynamic tracking.",1,2,1756372347.0,2025-08-28T09:12:27+00:00,t3_1n27cgr,SmallStreetBets
336,NVDA,CRWV BULLISH DD,"Alright listen up you red crayon eaters. Because it is time to turn your -90% portfolios to +400%.

CoreWeave has been bashed in recent times due to mounting debts. But not many billionaires would advise you to keep emergency cash in fact, borrowing is the meta to becoming rich. The printer never stops, you just need to outgrow inflation and grab all that newly minted benjamins. If CoreWeave was a soy boy, they'd be delisted in 2 years. To win, you need to take risks, and CoreWeave has done exactly that.

Sure their business model is absolutely asset intensive but 99% of men love assets. But enough yappers. Because I will show you some calculations on the breakdown on their CAPEX, and estimated OPEX.

Before we begin, as with most bullshit corporate documents, I will outline assumptions based on Gemini-able, GPT-able, GROX-able information. We will be assuming land cost, PUE, construction costs, and IT costs in estimates. Utility prices will be taken off latest available information off the net.

CoreWeave has reported that they are on track to deliver up to 900MW in their 2025 guidance. This is almost double their current active capacity, sitting at 470MW. But oh boy those datacenters they are gonna erect will give many Wallstreet Buffets wannabe ED. Sure, datacenters are expensive but the premium of these bad boy Grace and Blackwell supercomputers can command gives me viagra on crack and Redbull. The following calculations are all based in USD.

**First up CAPEX (on 430MW)**

Hard Construction Costs: $18M per Megawatt  
Soft Construction Costs: 20% of Hard Construction Costs  
Land Required/MW: \~550m^(2) (5,920ft^(2) for retards)  
Land Cost/m^(2) : $20  
Jensen Baby Cost per GB300 NVL72: \~$3M (each takes up 130kW)  
Assume 80% Fit-out of GB300 NVL72: 2,646 GB300 NVL72s = $7,939M  
Other supporting racks/IT (20% fit-out): $5M/MW = $430M

**Total CAPEX = $7,939M + $430M + $4.73M + $7,740M + $1,548M = $17,661.73M**

**Next up OPEX (on 430MW)**

Total IT Power = 430MW  
Assumed PUE = 1.2  
Total Power Consumption = 516MW  
Commercial Power Price = $0.1185/kWh  
Total Cost for Energy = $535.64M/year

Estimated Water Consumption = 2m^(3)/hour/MW  
Commercial Water Price = $6/m^(3)  
Total Price of Water = $45.21M/year

Asset Maintenance for IT (including depreciation): 5% of IT Cost/year  
Total Maintenance cost for IT = $418.45M/year  
Asset Maintenance for Electrical Systems: 3% of System Cost/year (41% of Construction Cost)  
Total Maintenance cost for Electrical Systems = $95.20M/year  
Asset Maintenance for Mechanical Systems: 4% of System Cost/year (25% of Construction Cost)  
Total Maintenance cost for Electrical Systems = $77.40M/year

Headcount: estimated 806, prorated  
Estimated average payroll/head: $150,000  
Total payroll: $120.9M/ year

**Total Annual OPEX = $535.64M + $45.21M + $418.45M + $95.20M + $77.40M + $120.9M = $1292.80M (excl interest expenses and depreciation)**

Considering CRWV announced capital expenditure of $20 \~ $23 billion, probably likely includes financing leases and acquisition of Core Scientific. But what the hell do they mean?

Based on earlier Q2 earnings suggests, the revenue per Megawatt is \~$11M. If we scale that up without considering any premium for the GB200/GB300, the revenue for just this 430MW is \~$4.73B, logically speaking, we might be looking at almost $5.4B instead.

Tech refresh cycles that is gonna be 3/4 years for these chips, that's fair. But these chips don't just go obsolete / worthless because some accountant deems their ""useful"" life a certain number of years. They can be repurposed, if they retain even 30% of their value in 3 years, the ROI will look even better, and eventually, D&amp;A becomes very misleading and conservative. The buildings and infrastructure are good for 10, 20 years so retrofitting them at fraction of the initial construction costs to suit future needs.

Considering EBITDA, the ROI is as low as 4.4 years, and based on GAAP, the ROI could be 10 years (4 years cycle). And if we consider 30% resale value of these chips at end of 4 years, the ROI can be 8.7 years.

Currently, the FY25 guidance are reporting a mix of Hopper racks and maybe just a quarter of GB200/GB300. As CRWV gain more contracts using GB200 &amp; GB300, and if they can grab and monopolize much of the available Blackwell chips, CRWV can command a higher premium. NVDA's stake in CRWV allows them to get priority access to latest chips, and they are very likely to be first to deploy the Vera Rubin slated to launch in 2026.

The whole AI shenanigans is still at the infant stages, all these large language models is really just the beginning. CRWV having 2.2GW of contracted capacity after acquiring Core Scientific is a calculated and strategic step to ensure they have room to grow at the pace they want to meet the demand they see.

Please do fact check my numbers if you have actual industry knowledge in the US, but they should be in the higher range. I highly believe actual numbers are even more optimistic.

**TLDR:** CoreWeave is basically lighting money on fire today so it can sell compute at premium tomorrow. Their $20–23B capex plan is insane scale, but it checks out: racks of $3M GB200/GB300, $18M/MW concrete palaces, and power bills that could run a small country.

Yes, depreciation nukes GAAP, but that’s just accounting cosplay — the GPUs don’t turn to dust after 3 years, they still earn or can be resold. Interest costs are a real drag, but adjusted EBITDA margins (\~60%+) show the core biz is printing.

The risk? Expansion outpaces demand or tech cycles compress faster than resale value. The upside? CRWV has Nvidia’s golden ticket, first dibs on new silicon, and 2.2GW of contracted capacity locked. Revenue will double, as a low hanging fruit next year.

**Position:** 175 shares @ $92.00 avg.

Numbers go brrr, depreciation makes GAAP cry, but the growth story is very real.

373,NVDA,Nvidia CEO Huang says bringing Blackwell AI chip to China ‘is a real possibility’,"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said there’s a “real possibility” the company brings its advanced Blackwell processor to China as he urges the U.S. government to open up access for American chipmakers.

He also predicted the artificial intelligence market in the world’s second-biggest economy will grow 50% next year.

“The opportunity for us to bring Blackwell to the China market is a real possibility,” Huang said on Wednesday in a call for Nvidia’s latest quarterly results. “We just have to keep advocating the importance of American tech companies to be able to lead and win the AI race, and help make the American tech stack the global standard.”

Huang personally visited the White House in July and August to secure export licenses for Nvidia’s current-generation chip for Chinese AI, called the H20. In August, the White House announced that President Donald Trump and Huang had struck a deal in which Nvidia would receive export licenses in exchange for 15% of China sales of the H20 going to the U.S. government.

After the meeting, Trump said he was open to making a deal for Blackwell chips, which is Nvidia’s latest AI technology that currently comprises the majority of its data center revenue.

Huang has said that it is better for Chinese AI developers to use Nvidia’s chips rather than force them to use homegrown Chinese options by preventing exports, which could incentivize the Chinese tech industry to catch up.

If Nvidia were to release a Blackwell chip in China, it could spur a large amount of sales as Chinese AI developers opt for the most powerful chips available. Nvidia would have to modify its Blackwell chips for the U.S. market to make them slower in certain aspects in order to comply with U.S. export regulations.

“The Blackwell is super-duper advanced. I wouldn’t make a deal with that,” Trump said in August, before adding that it was possible to make a deal for a “somewhat enhanced in a negative way” version of Blackwell.

Huang’s bullish comments on Wednesday come after the company reported second-quarter year-over-year revenue growth of 56% to $54 billion, despite not selling a single H20 chip to China during the quarter. Nvidia said it released $180 million in H20 inventory to a customer outside of China, which accounted for $650 million in sales.

Nvidia said it is not counting on any H20 sales in the October quarter as part of its forecast for $54 billion in revenue, but that the company could sell between $2 billion and $5 billion in H20 chips, depending on the geopolitical environment.

“If we had more orders, we can build more,” Nvidia finance chief Colette Kress said on the call with analysts.

Nvidia said that while it had received some licenses after the meeting with Trump, the U.S. government has yet to publish official regulations outlining how its cut of sales will work.

“USG officials have expressed an expectation that the USG will receive 15% of the revenue generated from licensed H20 sales, but to date, the USG has not published a regulation codifying such requirement,” Kress said.

Huang told analysts that China is the second-largest AI market in the world.

“The China market I’ve estimated to be about $50 billion of opportunity for us this year, if we were able to address it with competitive products,” Huang said. “And if it’s $50 billion this year, you would expect it to grow, say, 50% per year.”

Recent reports have indicated that the Chinese government is encouraging AI developers to use homegrown chips over those from Nvidia.

“We’re still waiting on several of the geopolitical issues going back and forth between the governments and the companies trying to determine their purchases and what they want to do,” Kress said.

113,NVDA,"Nvidia beats earnings, but no China H20 sales + “Blackwell” hype could accelerate the AI bubble","Welcome back, boys! The most anticipated earnings call of this month across the world has come.

Nvidia has just posted its Q2 numbers, and as everyone expected it came in ahead of expectations. EPS landed at $1.05, with revenue climbing more than 50% year-over-year. On the surface, it’s another beat, but there’s an important piece in the report: Nvidia reported no H20 chip sales in China this quarter, a hole that could represent $4 to 8 billion in lost revenue compared to prior periods. To get around restrictions, Nvidia recently struck a deal with the U.S. government that allows it to resume some China sales but at a steep cost, handing over 15% of its China chip revenue directly to the government.Looking forward to hearing everyone's thoughts!

CEO Jensen Huang leaned heavily into the company’s new Blackwell Ultra platform, calling it a “generational leap” with demand “ramping at full speed.” He highlighted NVLink rack-scale computing as “revolutionary,” stressing that it arrives just as reasoning AI models drive orders-of-magnitude increases in training and inference performance. In his own words: “The AI race is on, and Blackwell is the platform at its center.”

At the same time, Nvidia has been working to shore up its supply chain. A new magnets deal aims to secure rare-earth magnet capacity critical for GPU and data center expansion, insulating the company from geopolitical risks tied to China. Meanwhile, Nvidia continued returning capital to shareholders. In the first half of FY26 alone, it returned $24.3 billion through buybacks and dividends. The board just approved another $60 billion for share repurchases, essentially an open-ended program without expiration.

So where does this leave us? Nvidia is still printing massive results, but the cracks are starting to show, no China H20 revenue this quarter, revenue-sharing with the U.S. government cutting into margins, and growing tariff risks. At the same time, the stock is riding a $4 trillion valuation with expectations of $53 billion in revenue next quarter already priced in. The fundamentals are strong, but the narrative around “Blackwell” and the AI boom may be driving sentiment even more than the actual numbers. This isn’t the end of the AI story; it’s a coil tightening. If Q4 earnings do not show significant improvement and independence, the pressure that has been building will likely lead to a massive sell-off in FY27.

TLDR: Nvidia beat Q2 FY26 with $1.05 EPS and 50% YoY revenue growth, but reported zero China H20 sales (a $4–8B hole). To offset, it cut a deal giving the U.S. government 15% of China chip revenue and secured a new magnets deal to stabilize supply chains. Jensen hyped Blackwell Ultra as the “AI platform of the future,” and the board authorized a fresh $60B buyback. Fundamentals are strong, but with a $4T valuation and $53B already priced into Q3, this feels less like smooth sailing and more like a coil tightening one slip in Q4 or FY27, and the downside could get very real.",77,10,1756337988.0,2025-08-27T23:39:48+00:00,t3_1n1ww6e,StockMarket

The company reported Q2 data center revenue topped out at $41.1 billion. Analysts were expecting $41.3 billion, according to data from Bloomberg. Segment revenue was $26.2 billion in the prior-year period. The numbers didn't include sales of its lower-powered H20 chips into China.

Nvidia also noted that approximately 50% of its data center revenue came from large cloud service providers.

The company's stock price fell more than 3% on the news in after-hours trading.

Nvidia's EPS and revenue growth have moderated over the past few quarters following the massive growth spikes it saw during the onset of the AI craze. Total revenue growth in its latest quarter came in at the slowest pace since the [first quarter of its fiscal year 2024.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-sinks-after-data-center-sales-miss-forecasts-ceo-calls-blackwell-demand-extraordinary-162719461.html)",334,72,1756330199.0,2025-08-27T21:29:59+00:00,t3_1n1trnp,StockMarket
79,NVDA,NVDA 2Q26 Earnings Result,"**Earnings per share**: $1.05, adjusted, up 54% from a year ago

**Revenue**: Revenue of $46.7 billion, up 6% from Q1 and up 56% from a year ago

NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) today reported revenue for the second quarter ended July 27, 2025, of $46.7 billion, up 6% from the previous quarter and up 56% from a year ago. NVIDIA’s Blackwell Data Center revenue grew 17% sequentially.

There were no H20 sales to China-based customers in the second quarter. NVIDIA benefited from a $180 million release of previously reserved H20 inventory, from approximately $650 million in unrestricted H20 sales to a customer outside of China.

Data Center revenue for the second quarter was $41.1 billion, up 56% from a year ago and up 5% sequentially. The strong year-on-year and sequential growth was driven by demand for our accelerated computing platform used for large language models, recommendation engines, and generative and agentic AI applications. We continue to ramp our Blackwell architecture, which grew 17% sequentially, including our newest architecture, Blackwell Ultra. We recognized Blackwell revenue across all customer categories, led by large cloud service providers, which represented approximately 50% of Data Center revenue.

Data Center compute revenue was $33.8 billion, up 50% from a year ago. Sequentially, compute revenue declined 1%, driven by a $4.0 billion reduction in H20 sales. Networking revenue was $7.3 billion, up 98% from a year ago and up 46% sequentially, driven by the growth of NVLink compute fabric for GB200 and GB300 systems, the ramp of XDR InfiniBand products, and adoption of Ethernet for AI solutions at cloud service providers and consumer internet companies.

**Outlook**  
NVIDIA’s outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2026 is as follows:

* Revenue is expected to be $54.0 billion, plus or minus 2%. The company has not assumed any H20 shipments to China in the outlook.
* GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 73.3% and 73.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. The company continues to expect to exit the year with non-GAAP gross margins in the mid-70% range.
* GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $5.9 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively. Full year fiscal 2026 operating expense growth is expected to be in the high-30% range.
* GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expense are expected to be an income of approximately $500 million, excluding gains and losses from non-marketable and publicly-held equity securities.
* GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 16.5%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items.",475,196,1756326398.0,2025-08-27T20:26:38+00:00,t3_1n1s58d,stocks

374,NVDA,Short squeeze potential on volatility due to hedge funds short vol as we enter higher risk month,"Apparently hedge funds are trying to make up for April losses by shorting vol. If you've ever traded it you know what can happen and this set up presents a good opportunity for traders willing to accept risk. 

We haven't seen a sharp VIX spike since April but it won't take much for this to rip again if shorts have to cover. 

Factors that can create a short term spike is Nvidia meeting expectations or not beating as much as people want. That gives the market an excuse to fade a little off these ATHs. Also heading into end of month we tend to see selling and rebalancing. If it's a blowout earnings number the VIX will drop, temporarily- ideal time to trade for a flip or buy and hold. 

Into Sept is optimism about a rate cut that can refuel a tech lead rally, sending vol lower up to the FED announcement but note selling usually occurs around Rosh Hashanah and vol spikes again.

“In the immediate term, markets will probably get over the Cook news fairly quickly (assuming this is a discrete event and Trump doesn’t attempt to fire Powell), turning its attention back to Nvidia, the PCE, and jobs, but the Fed’s independence is undeniably being undermined, a process with negative long-term consequences,” said Adam Crisafulli, founder of Vital Knowledge.

271,NVDA,August Experimental Portfolio Update (vs SPY): Declaring Winners &amp; Laggards,"Quick update on the experimental portfolio we've developed to transparently present the performance of our three frameworks (Quality, Dividend, Value) with $2k per position on 1 Aug 2025, $10k per strategy, $30k total. Benchmark is SPY.

**Results so far (through Aug 26, 2025):**

Quality: +2.37% (under SPY by –0.97%)  
Dividend: +7.75% (outperforming SPY by +4.41%)  
Value: +9.04% (outperforming SPY by +5.71%)

Combined portfolio: +6.39% vs SPY’s +3.34% = +3.05% alpha

**Interpretation:**

\- Value and Dividend picks are doing the heavy lifting here.  
\- Quality names (ADBE, NVDA, META, etc.) are positive but lagging SPY so far.   
\- Returns shown are price-only (no dividends included for either stock positions or SPY). Dividend reinvestment will be added in a future version.

**Methodology:**

Baseline: all calculations from Aug 1 close prices.  
Position sizing: equal-weighted ($2k each).  
Prices + benchmarks pulled from FMP API.  
Alpha = portfolio return – SPY return.

So, after about 3 weeks: +6.39% total portfolio return, comfortably ahead of SPY’s +3.34%. Not bad for the first month, but of course, one data point doesn't make a track record!

420,NVDA,$SPX Elephant in the room,"U.S. equity markets tend to rally during the week before and after a Fed chair’s Jackson Hole speech, “as they first partially discount policy clarity and then finish the job over the subsequent five days,” Colas said.

 Powell’s remarks on Friday seemed “to bless a September rate cut,” an expected Fed policy shift that had already been reflected in the federal-funds futures market, he wrote.

In a separate note early last week, DataTrek analyzed the S&amp;P 500’s performance surrounding Jackson Hole speeches from Fed chairs over a period running from 2010 through 2024. Colas calculated that over that time frame, the S&amp;P 500 returned an average 0.6% in the five days after the Jackson Hole event — noting that Fed chairs did not attend the annual gathering of central bankers in two years with that period, including 2013 and 2015. Stocks like CRWV, NVDA, AMD, BGM, CRM, and META might be influenced.

 The S&amp;P 500 climbed 1.5% Friday, closing the trading session with a weekly rise of 0.3%.

82,NVDA,NVDA Up 35% Into Earnings,"Nvidia reports earnings on Wednesday (Aug 27) after the close, and the setup looks like a textbook high-stakes event. The stock is currently trading at $181.30, up over 35% in the past three months, and the technicals tell a mixed story heading into earnings. On the positive side, the long-term trend is still strong. Nvidia is trading above its 10-day ($179), 50-day ($167), and 200-day ($137) moving averages, which confirms that the uptrend remains intact and the bulls are in control on a broader timeframe.

However, the short-term signals show some cracks. The RSI sits at 73.4, which is firmly in overbought territory. To be clear, this doesn’t always mean the stock will drop immediately, but it does raise the probability of profit-taking in the near term. The MACD has slipped below the signal line (2.92 vs. 4.43), and the histogram has been shrinking since mid-August, indicating fading momentum. Volume has also flatlined while price continued to rise, often a sign that buyers are running out of steam ahead of a major catalyst.

Historically, Nvidia tends to move around ±8% after its earnings announcements. Given the massive run it’s already had this quarter, the risk/reward skews toward the downside. Yes, if Nvidia beats expectations and raises guidance, the stock could break through $190–200 and extend its rally. But with RSI overbought, MACD momentum weakening, and volume drying up, there’s also a real chance of a “sell the news” reaction back toward $170 to 160, even on solid earnings.

TLDR: The long-term trend remains bullish, but in the short-term, Nvidia is priced for perfection. Technicals suggest momentum is tiring, so investors should be prepared for volatility and not be surprised if the first reaction is red before the next leg higher.",368,160,1756141896.0,2025-08-25T17:11:36+00:00,t3_1mzwfjs,stocks
376,NVDA,"Nvidia’s new ‘robot brain’ goes on sale for $3,499 as company targets robotics for growth","Nvidia announced Monday that its latest robotics chip module, the Jetson AGX Thor, is now on sale for $3,499 as a developer kit.

The company calls the chip a “robot brain.” The first kits ship next month, Nvidia said last week, and the chips will allow customers to create robots.

After a company uses the developer kit to prototype their robot, Nvidia will sell Thor T5000 modules that can be installed in production-ready robots. If a company needs more than 1,000 Thor chips, Nvidia will charge $2,999 per module.

CEO Jensen Huang has said robotics is the company’s largest growth opportunity outside of artificial intelligence, which has led to the Nvidia’s overall sales more than tripling in the past two years.

“We do not build robots, we do not build cars, but we enable the whole industry with our infrastructure computers and the associated software,” said Deepu Talla, Nvidia’s vice president of robotics and edge AI, on a call with reporters Friday.

The Jetson Thor chips are based on a Blackwell graphics processor, which is Nvidia’s current generation of technology used in its AI chips, as well as its chips for computer games.

Nvidia said that its Jetson Thor chips are 7.5 times faster than its previous generation. That allows them to run generative AI models, including large language models and visual models that can interpret the world around them, which is essential for humanoid robots, Nvidia said. The Jetson Thor chips are equipped with 128GB of memory, which is essential for big AI models.

Companies including Agility Robotics, Amazon, Meta and Boston Dynamics are using its Jetson chips, Nvidia said. Nvidia has also invested in robotics companies such as Field AI.

However, robotics remains a small business for Nvidia, accounting for about 1% of the company’s total revenue, despite the fact that it has launched several new robot chips since 2014. But it’s growing fast.

Nvidia recently combined its business units to group its automotive and robotics divisions into the same line item. That unit reported $567 million in quarterly sales in May, which represented a 72% increase on an annual basis.

The company said its Jetson Thor chips can be used for self-driving cars as well, especially from Chinese brands. Nvidia calls its car chips Drive AGX, and while they are similar to its robotics chips, they run an operating system called Drive OS that’s been tuned for automotive purposes.

August 18, 2025 – August 22, 2025","First of all, I don't want to be misunderstood. This heat map is weekly that it visualized via closing prices from August 15 to August 22.

Last Friday, the S&amp;P 500 closed lower and started a losing streak. This week, the stock market focused on Powell's speech from Monday.

📊 Here are the S&amp;P 500's week-by-week results for the last 4 week,

July 25 close at 6,388.64 - August 1 close at 6,238.01 🔴 (-2.36%)

August 1 close at 6,238.01 - August 8 close at 6,389.45 🟢 (2.43%)

August 8 close at 6,389.45 - August 15 close at 6,449.79 🟢 (0.94%)

August 15 close at 6,449.79 - August 22 close at 6,466.91 🟢 (0.27%)

🔸 Monday: Last Friday, Trump and Putin met and Trump said ""Big progress on Russia. Stay tuned."", but given no details. The stock market opened flat. The stock market awaiting for Jackson Hole and Powell's speech this week. It was a quiet session. The stock market closed flat. The S&amp;P 500 ended lower, but down just 0.01%. 🔴

🔸 Tuesday: Trump said Putin and Zelenskiy will meet at undetermined location. U.S. and China trade war continues. Bessent said Nvidia will require a license for any new China chip. The stock market opened flat again. The license news triggered selling in Nasdaq. The stock market closed lower more than 0.5%. 🔴

🔸 Wednesday: Trump continued to pressure on Powell for a rate cut. He said Powell is hurting the housing industry. In the United Kingdom, CPI released and rose 3.8%. It's highest since January 2024. The stock market opened flat after tech selloff yesterday. During the session, Fed minutes showed ""wait and see"" approach. In the last hour of session, tech selloff slowed down, but the stock market closed lower. 🔴

🔸 Thursday: U.S. and EU released joint trade deal statement. U.S. caps EU auto &amp; tech tariffs at 15%. Also, EU will invest $600B by 2028. Schmid said no rush to cut rates with inflation above target. The stock market opened lower. During the session, Fed's Navarro said Powell is so Anti-Trump, it's unsettling. On the other hand, Fed's Hammack said wouldn't see a case for September cut due to inflation trending up. The stock market closed lower ahead of Powell speech. 🔴

🔸 Friday: It was came big day. The stock market awaited for a week and opened higher. Also, White House announced Trump to make announcement noon. Powell opens door to September rate cut. I surprised. The stock market surged. Trump said U.S. take 10% stake in Intel and new tariffs on furniture imports. Barclays shifted Fed rate cut forecast from December to September. The stock market closed higher over 1.5%. The S&amp;P 500 broke 5-day losing streak. 🟢

For a long time, Powell hadn'r given positive sign. This time was a big surprise and the stock market reacted very positively for a single day gaining. The S&amp;P 500 gained more in a day more than first four days lost. The probability of September rate cut is 75% in CME FedWatch Tool, but there are still 24 days to meeting. I will continue to follow the 6,200 level for stop-loss point in my trading portfolio. I don't plan to sell my long-term portfolio for a long time yet.

120,NVDA,95% of AI businesses are not making money with AI ...,"Hi,

You've probably heard about this study showing that the vast majority of companies investing in AI projects have no profitability. But is that shocking in itself? Not really. During the Gold Rush, many invested heavily to go find gold in the American West. They bought licenses, tools, paid workers, etc. And in the end, very few made a fortune with gold.

But this study reminds me of the dot-com crisis in the 2000s, which we largely overlook because we focus more on 2008, as it was more brutal for the economy. But in the late '90s, the internet was emerging. People said it would revolutionize our lives, and it did. A ton of companies bet on the internet to attract investors. It became mandatory to have "".com"" in your logo to show you were part of this revolution. At the time, we saw companies like Microsoft, IBM, and other tech firms riding the wave to prominence. But one stood out: Cisco. It was breaking all records on the stock market. It was the ""Nvidia"" of the internet.

However, it became clear that companies banking their business on the internet weren’t making any money from it. They offered services through the internet, but no revenue was generated from this revolution. We saw massive investments from these companies but absolutely no revenue to justify those investments. That was the dot-com crisis. We watched companies with their "".com"" branding vanish.

And the company that was hit the hardest was Cisco, to the point that, even after 25 years, Cisco still hasn’t recovered its pre-crisis stock price. In the end, a ton of companies disappeared, whether they were search engines, e-commerce sites, chat platforms, or internet providers. And year after year, the market rationalized. There’s one main search engine, one messenger that takes off, then gradually social networks emerge, and so on. People stopped talking about the internet itself and increasingly focused on the services it enabled.

Today, we’re seeing something similar. Companies have replaced "".com"" with ""AI."" We’re seeing companies starting to explain that their services have reached a limit in terms of revolution (ChatGPT) and that now, we’re moving more toward gradual evolution over time. And maybe now is the moment to take stock and see if OpenAI and other companies are starting to become profitable. So perhaps we’re reaching a point where there will be a shakeout in the AI market, where some companies will have to justify their investments.

424,NVDA,AI vs Markets: feeding ETFs into GPT &amp; Grok | Project Compete,"I just wrapped up this build, documented it, and now I’m moving on to a new project. But first — here’s the journey I just finished.  


[Enter 9 Sector CSV ETF Attachments as Trading Universe](https://preview.redd.it/2mfhfvihvikf1.png?width=1917&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fbdb2b966f11b9ab123f3c61be681470509a6d62)

First, I loaded in the ETFs as my trading universe. That’s the population of tickers GPT and Grok get to search through.

[Add the Promot Instructions](https://preview.redd.it/hf8uoyihvikf1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c32fe323223d7f4b396bbc3b9ddcf19d7b06b7be)



Next, I wrote instructions that filter stocks down to only the ones with fresh, credible, and liquid catalysts — no rumors, no binaries, no chaotic moves. From there, they get ranked by recency, durability, and sentiment to decide bullish or bearish bias and strength. The system then spits out 27 names, three per sector, in JSON with catalyst, bias, and a simple +10% flip plan.



[Add the Prompt](https://preview.redd.it/ahcgsmjhvikf1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc80d707a6818f96e2a9711d38f25b5a5fe9d486)

Then I actually fire off the prompt. It runs against the CSV tickers, filters them, scores them, and outputs the JSON of exactly 27 picks — or however many it finds that clear the rules.

After that, I return two searches: Grok 4, and GPT 5 Deep Research:  
\*\* 20 minutes for Grok  
\*\* 15 minutes for GPT.

Then I go into the [**sectors.py**](http://sectors.py/) file and update the tickers with the new results. I’m working on automating this so GPT and Grok can directly output in the right format.



[Run Script](https://preview.redd.it/qsqpfyihvikf1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34adcf0a85bc02cb04c49bd1864fc48e122c5a26)

  
Once that’s set, I run my scripts, which are all on GitHub. Those scripts generate results and spit out a final\_credit\_spread JSON.



[Retrieve Results](https://preview.redd.it/mla8rmjhvikf1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7b53f475403e2ad5e99904e43a5bd606bed83e0)

  
That JSON gets attached to the second prompt, and I run it.

Finally, the outputs from GPT-5 and Grok-4 come together — and that’s the finished product.

377,NVDA,"Trump’s Slashes to Renewables Will Send  $CVX, $OXY, and $BE to the Moon","Yesterday, Trump announced that the US will not approve solar or wind power projects moving forward. This in and of itself may sound as bullish news for the oil, gas, and coal industries as money rotates into these sectors from renewables, but my bull case for stocks in the power industry has more to do with the direction of AI advancement and the role of power production in that.

https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2025/08/20/trump-says-us-will-not-approve-solar-or-wind-power-projects.html

AI technology is really comprised of three segments: chips, data centers, and power. As of today, the chip companies have surged in share price (though they’re starting to take a hit), data centers are being developed expeditiously and backed by heavy investment, and, on the power side, we’re checks notes blocking the growth of a major sector of the power generation industry? There’s a weak link in this group. The forward-looking market potentially pricing in this worsening barrier to AI growth could be the first step towards an “AI Bubble” popping. Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, and Google make up over 25% of the S&amp;P 500, and they’re at risk of taking a hit if something isn’t quickly done by the Federal Government to address a known upcoming bottleneck for AI advancement: Energy production. Sam Altman of OpenAI reportedly wants to spend “trillions” on data center development, and these data centers all need to be powered somehow (I’ll touch on this a little later). To sustain the US’ technological advancement, our energy production must expand to meet the needs of the data centers, and the Trump administration just slashed the fastest growing sector of the power industry. If we stop expanding renewable energy, non-renewable energy must grow, and I think the federal government will be motivated by the race with China and the pressure of a stock market downturn to give some support to the big oil, gas, and coal players.

Info on the AI-energy bottleneck: https://qz.com/ai-data-center-boom-us-power-grid-struggles

US is behind China on energy production for data centers: https://fortune.com/2025/08/14/data-centers-china-grid-us-infrastructure/

Chevron and Occidental are two US based oil and gas companies I’ve got my eye on. They’re both backed by Berkshire Hathaway (notably, more $CVX was acquired in Q2 by Berkshire), they’re positioned to later transition into renewables if the political landscape proves it to be more advantageous in the future, and, most importantly, they are poised to moon.

$MP was the big position I took in April, and this current situation gives me very similar vibes. Here’s the analogy: China is far ahead of the US in certain crucial resources (rare earth metals and energy production) necessary for technological advancement, then political policy placed constraints on the supply. The US’ access to energy is not being immediately slashed like it was with the China rare earth metals ban, however, we are approaching an AI-energy bottleneck and high interest rates + cuts to funding for renewable energy + Trump’s new stance on just not approving renewable energy projects is choking a significant and expanding sector of an industry that the country NEEDS to expand. We also know Trump does not want to be reliant on other countries for resources crucial to the US’ technological advancement.

At minimum, I see more news coverage (as a result of Trump’s latest statements) on the energy industry’s role as one of the Big 3 in the AI space, therefore pushing the stock price up. My more optimistic prediction is that new policies will be announced in which the federal government gives greater support to the oil, gas, and coal industries in a similar way to what happened with $MP.

Now, here’s the sleeper play. In doing my research on data center development, which as a reminder, Sam Altman intends to invest “trillions” into, I came across something of interest. Oracle has partnered with OpenAI and is in rapid development of data centers for OpenAI. The demand for these data centers is so large that developers like Oracle are planning to build them and get them off the ground far before they’re able to connect these data centers to the power grid. How will the data centers be powered without connection to the power grid? Gas generators made by Bloom Energy ($BE). It’s a bit more of a speculative play, but this company is focused on gas generators for data centers, they’ve got contracts, and the demand is very quickly surging.

338,NVDA,I have strong belief that grandma's intel investment would have made sense if Grandma lived a bit longer and timed the market better.,":

EDIT : Forgot to mention that options are dirt cheap.  
EDIT 2 : Just to make it clear, the title is about that guy who invested a ridiculous amount of grandmas inheritance money  into Intel and lost like 10% instantly.

I'd like to start this post by saying I used to trade forex using supply/demand and Wyckoff strategy.  
Some of the reasons why I say I used to trade forex are your usual revenge trading, dropping strategy rules just to open a trade due to being impatient etc.  
All those mental challenges coupled with high leverage never turns out well.  
One thing I took out of that experience was definitely a strategy or two that I realised are worth gold while looking at stock price charts.  
Recently I managed to catch Roblox on a run up based on supply/demand strategy and I made couple of thousand % using options.  
All that being said,I believe I have the next big play.  
I want to start by saying that there are few reasons why I believe this is a high conviction play.

I base my opinion on technical and fundamental analysis.

Technical one goes as follows:

The higher time frame, the higher the conviction seems to be the case for the strategies I'm using  
I see a pattern of ""Wyckoff"" in particular : Accumulation being formed on the highest timeframe I've seen so far.  
I don't want to go too deep into what Wyckoff is: There is plenty of info here [https://www.wyckoffanalytics.com/wyckoff-method/](https://www.wyckoffanalytics.com/wyckoff-method/)  
You can briefly get the idea from the picture.  
Highly skilled traders can have a win rate using Wyckoff of upto 70% which is just crazy.

Fundamental :

There are few reasons as to why I believe Intel is going to see some green days;  
First being interest rates coming down as projected by few investment banks.  
Second being that Intel is being crushed by competitors and have unsuccessfully been playing catch-up game with them.  
The next chip ( Panther Lake) launch window is just around the corner (Late 2025 to early 2026).

Intel is trying to compete with TSMC by offering foundry services on its advanced 18A and 14A nodes.

If a major customer (e.g., Apple, Qualcomm, or even NVIDIA) commits to Intel Foundry, the stock could re-rate sharply

Japans SoftBank Group invested 2 billion into Intel.  
US Government is exploring an option of investing 2.2billion aswell.

I believe that Intel will reach 50 dollars no later then their 1st quarter 2026 earnings.

I'm going full Diamond Hands with this idea by buying these options.

Wish me luck because this pulling through would earn me part of the money I would buy my first property with.

Not a financial advice.

Muse, an analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, called the demand for AI compute “seemingly insatiable” in a recent note and raised his price target from $200 to $240 on Monday, for one of the highest targets on Wall Street. Sustained capital-expenditure investments from hyperscalers, increased sovereign investments and adoption of enterprise AI are driving demand for GPUs even higher than originally expected, according to Muse. Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh pointed out that Big Tech capex estimates have increased in recent months from 38% to 54% year over year. With analysts boosting outlooks on AI demand and hyperscaler capex, stocks like PLTR, BGM, CRM, and CRWV stand to benefit from the accelerating investment cycle.

339,NVDA,$Wulf - time to talk about value/gamma play 3M+ invested.,"Hi fellow regards. Infrequent but long time poster here. Posted about RKT and the one who cannot be named gamma ramp in 2021.  Today I want to tell you about the value play in WULF  and potential gamma ramp. No garbage AI needed. 

Everyone knows Nvidia and AI, and the big players meta Google OpenAI. There is a computing shortage for these AI companies and data centre companies who provide high power computing (hpc) and picking up hype.  One such player, among 5 others, is terawulf which is situated near New York.  They had a 1 billion usd contract with core42 but as of today this has expanded to over 7 billion after fluidstack/google deal (with a market cap stock of 3.9 billion)

Key factors:
The value bit. 
1- 7.7 billion in revenue in 10 years
2- no chance of default with Google backstopping 3.2 billion for 14% of the company, effectively evaluating it at 22.8 billion (6x current price)
3- No real share dilution in the last year (except above but Google won’t sell). No insider sells. 
4- still has more MW room to grow. 

The gamma ramp bit. 
3- 64% institutional ownership
4- 32% SI, 36% SV ratio
5- Recent catalyst with hyperscaler Google contract (++ exposure)

Where I think it’ll grow? $20 by December but local higher in the interim by gamma ramp potential. 

Good luck regards. Posting one of my brokerage positions. ",152,64,1755536587.0,2025-08-18T17:03:07+00:00,t3_1mtrv58,wallstreetbets
380,NVDA,Neocloud Operators (like $CRWV) Depend on Nvidia Chips Staying Expensive,"&gt;Once upon a very recent time, Nvidia Corp.’s H100 was the crown jewel that everyone in AI was after. A badge of honor in model-training runs, the chip defined an era of bragging rights among artificial intelligence developers. But as Nvidia commits to annual generational leaps, and boss Jensen Huang sells each one as profoundly essential, the question of what to do with older hardware rises in importance.

&gt;CoreWeave Inc., a close partner to Nvidia and one of the newfangled neocloud providers, has an idea for solving that challenge. It’s not glamorous or particularly ingenious, but it neatly ties together the two key processes in AI work - training, the most intensive but briefer operation of cramming information into your AI model, and inference, which is the more voluminous and workmanlike job of querying that library of data to produce hopefully smart-sounding responses. When the time comes to upgrade, CoreWeave just uses the outdated cutting-edge hardware on the simpler job.

&gt;“What happens is, the prior generation begins to pick up the load on inference,” Chief Executive Officer Michael Intrator told me last week. “We are not seeing meaningful declines in H100 demand, which is the prior generation of the Grace Blackwell, which is the cutting edge right now.”

&gt;There’s what he called “broad-based inference demand absorbing that compute” - compute being the industry term for computational power. Many of the same customers shopping for the most advanced chips for their model training are also “looking to support the ever-growing demands of inference.”

&gt;That’s one of the biggest deployers of Nvidia’s high-performance compute making the case that we don’t need the very latest for every task. Inference has proven friendly to hardware that’s one cycle old. If CoreWeave is right, the real economic story of GPUs may be not just the rush to the newest silicon, but the expanding afterlife of what might have been considered obsolete.

&gt;CoreWeave sits at the center of that story. It isn’t a fully-formed hyperscaler in the mold of Amazon Web Services ot Microsoft Corp.’s Azure; its neocloud designation refers to how tailored its infrastructure is for AI workloads.

&gt;The business model is simple in theory, punishing in practice: borrow heavily to build specialized data centers, line up customers like OpenAI and Microsoft, and rent compute at scale. It’s high-growth, but it’s also high-risk - utilization has to stay very high to cover the financing, and the resale value of yesterday’s silicon matters a lot more than in the hyperscaler world.

&gt;That’s why H100s showing up in the secondary market are worth watching. Resales - and their price - may either validate or cast some doubt on CoreWeave’s reasoning.

&gt;Hyperscalers rotate out old hardware quickly; for them, training always moves to the latest chips and inference often runs cheaper elsewhere. Neocloud operators face more pressure. Miss utilization targets, or buckle under financing costs, and you’ll have to start selling off the hardware as a release valve. The result: racks of lightly used H100s hitting the market at steep discounts, reminding everyone that obsolescence in this business comes on a 12–18 month cycle.

&gt;All of that landed with a thud on Wall Street this past week. CoreWeave reported widening losses, surging capex, and an outlook that spooked investors who had bid the stock up severalfold since its IPO. Shares slumped 21% the day after earnings and gave up another 15% the following day. The message was clear: demand for AI compute may be unprecedented, but scaling fast enough to meet it - without crushing margins - is proving harder than the hype cycle suggested.

&gt;The obsession with cutting-edge hardware makes for flashy launches, investor buzz, and multibillion-dollar stock swings. But the deeper story may be how older generations of silicon are repurposed - whether by neocloud operators wringing inference value out of the previously prized GPUs or hyperscalers rotating stock into resale markets.

In the session, Trump announced two important things about tariffs that are deadline with China was extended 90 days and gold will not be tariffed. The stock market closed slightly lower. 🔴

🔸 Tuesday: Before the session, CPI inflation was released and rose 0.2%. Core CPI inflation rose 0.3% month-over-month and there was expectation. However, CPI increased 2.7% year-over-year and expectation was 2.8%. As a result, the probability of rate cut rose over 90% in CME FedWatch Tool. The stock market opened higher. The S&amp;P 500 jumped over 6,427 that is the all-time high value from July 31. Trump had continued to want to lower interest rate.

89,NVDA,$APLD - 10 bagger AI DATA CENTER,"APLD is positioning themselves as one of the few players building the kind of high-performance data centers that AI workloads actually demand. We're talking racks stacked with GPU's pulling power at a massive scale.

On paper, they've got around 400MW scheduled to come online nby 2027. That's just what's already been announced. Management has been clear that if they can line up more power, they'll keep scaling aggressively. And when you run the numbers, the revenue potential starts looking pretty wild.

Here's the simple math: industry rates for high-performance hosting earn about $.35 to $.50 per watt per month, with AI workloads usually toward the higher end. Annualied that's $6,000 per kW, or $6M per MW. Multiply that by 400 MW and you're looking at roughly $2.4B in yearly revenue potential.

Even if you haircut that for more conservative assumptions- say $.40/watt and a 45% margin - it still works out to a business throwing off serious cash. Data center operators at scale tend to run 50% EBITDA margins, so $2.4B in revenue would translate into \~1.2B in EBITDA. And right now the market is valuing infrastructure names feeding the AI boom at 10-20x EBITDA. That points to a market cap anywhere from $12B on the low end to north of $20B if they execute well.

The bigger lever, though, is capacity. If they can find another 200-300 MW to build out on top of the 400 MW roadmap, the earnings power scales dramatically. The real bottleneck here isn't GPUs - it's electricity. APLD's edge is that their sites are in power-friendly locations where expansion is actually possible.

I originally came across this stock while doing some modeling work on NVDA for a client. CoreWeave, which NVDA owns a stake in, cut a deal with APLD not long ago - and the stock ripped up 50%. APLD is essentially a landlord, and companies like CoreWeave are the tenants, leasing AI power.

118,NVDA,U.S. Government Considering Equity Stake in $INTC. A comeback?,"Hey everyone,

Reports dropped on August 14th that the U.S. government is looking at taking an equity stake in Intel. Not just subsidies, but actually owning a piece of America’s biggest chipmaker.  


Intel jumped more than 12% in a day, and it’s now up around 20% on the week. Not bad for a stock that was trading at $8.85 just a year ago, now hovering in the mid-teens.

Why would Washington step in?

* Intel’s the only U.S. company still trying to make leading-edge chips.
* The government doesn’t want to rely on Taiwan (TSMC) if things with China heat up.
* They want a U.S. “national champion” in semis, and Intel is basically it.

The investing angle:  
  
Intel’s still spending insane amounts on fabs—Ohio, Arizona, Germany. Even with CHIPS Act subsidies, they’re burning cash. A government stake could keep the lights on and give them more runway. But let’s be real: it doesn’t fix Intel’s execution problems. They still need to prove they can make competitive chips again.

Right now, INTC trades at \~14x forward earnings—cheap compared to AMD (\~35x) or Nvidia (\~45x). Bulls say government backing makes it safer. Bears say you’re buying a laggard that only survives because Uncle Sam has its back.

This could be a turning point in U.S. industrial policy. We’re used to subsidies and bailouts, but direct equity stakes in major tech companies? That’s new. Could set the tone for how Washington treats “strategic” industries going forward.

INTC worth it or just temporary pump?",19,22,1755323597.0,2025-08-16T05:53:17+00:00,t3_1mrmbas,SmallStreetBets
381,NVDA,What might Trumpian meddling mean for Intel?,"&gt;What Intel needs more than new board members is customers for its manufacturing, or “foundry”, arm. They have not been forthcoming, partly because Intel’s chip-design business competes with would-be buyers such as AMD and Nvidia. A second transaction offers some clues as to how they might be persuaded. In July America’s Defence Department invested $400m in MP Materials, a producer of rare-earth metals, and will guarantee the price it receives for its output at above-market rates. A few days later Apple, involved in its own negotiations with the president, also announced a supply agreement with MP Materials. Mr Trump may demand that chip designers such as AMD and Nvidia, which rely on his approval to sell their products in China, use Intel’s manufacturing. A more radical option could see him force them to club together and purchase Intel’s struggling foundry business. That’s a deal any activist would be proud of pulling off.

If *The Economist*’s prediction comes true, which customers will Trump find for the 18A process? If Trump even goes so far as to force U.S. companies to adopt the 14A process, will Intel revive its foundry investments in 14A?

343,NVDA,Why the US Government will buy into INTC - Beyond the Rumors,"Intel is the only U.S. company pursuing leading-edge logic foundry tech on U.S. soil.  Every single big tech company that designs AI chips has to go through TSMC, including nvidia.  Elon recently inked a deal with samsung.  Neither which are US based.

We can't rely on TSMC if something happens to Taiwan.  Though TSMC US plants are making good progress.  
  
DoD this years has already invested in MP Materials, for domestic rare earth mining and processing.   For the same reason they will invest in advanced chip manufacturing.  
*The U.S. Department of Defense now classifies advanced chip production as ""critical infrastructure.""*  
  
Intel has had to delay building more advanced fabs due to funding issues.  The DoD can see that adding money here could be really good for advanced domestic chip production.

The cost to import chips produced abroad could be subject to tariffs.

Trump has talked about building a sovereign wealth fund, and has said in the past we should have taken a stake while doing bailouts rather than just getting paid back via loans.

Position:  
35 price target 6 month calls - modest % of portfolio

  
Here's ChatGPT's take on my argument:

  
Thesis

Intel is the **only U.S.-owned firm pursuing leading-edge logic foundry on U.S. soil**. A strategic equity stake would extend the existing policy toolkit (CHIPS grants/loans, “Secure Enclave” procurement) to secure domestic capacity at advanced nodes, reduce Taiwan exposure, and align incentives for private capital and customers.

# Strategic rationale (condensed)

* **Unique role:** Intel is the **sole American company** attempting cutting-edge logic foundry domestically (18A → 14A), with U.S.-based R&amp;D and wafer production. That’s Intel’s and third-party assessments, and it’s the crux of the national-security argument.
* **Critical infrastructure framing:** Semiconductor manufacturing sits inside DHS/CISA’s **Critical Manufacturing Sector** and the National Critical Functions framework—formal grounds for extraordinary support.
* **Taiwan exposure, partial mitigation:** Any Taiwan shock imperils access to top-end logic. **TSMC Arizona** helps, but Fab 2 N3 **targets 2028** and N2/A16 arrive **late decade**; that’s not a complete hedge today.
* **Policy precedent (blueprint):** In **July 2025**, DoD agreed to buy **$400M** of **convertible preferred** in **MP Materials** plus a **warrant** (≈**15%** as-converted/as-exercised), then **August 2025** added a **$150M OSC loan**—a public-private package to onshore a choke point. That’s the closest analogue to an Intel equity leg.
* **Existing Intel funding (stack to build on):** Commerce awarded Intel **up to $7.865B** in CHIPS **direct funding** (plus eligibility for loans) across AZ/NM/OH/OR, and **up to $3B** for the DoD/Commerce **Secure Enclave** to expand trusted leading-edge manufacturing for government. Equity would better align upside/downside with taxpayers and help de-risk customer onboarding.
* **Execution/funding gap:** Intel has **pushed Ohio** first-fab production into **2030–2031**; equity/offtake can stabilize capex cadence and accelerate schedule confidence.
* **Trade lever (demand shaper):** The administration is **floating large semiconductor tariffs**—recent on-record signals cite **up to 300%**—with exemptions for U.S. production. Tariffs + procurement + equity is a classic triad to pull volume onshore.

# Anticipating pushback (answer in one line)

* **“Just use TSMC Arizona.”** It ramps in stages (N4 in Q4’24; N3 **2028**; N2/A16 **late decade**). Policy needs **redundant, U.S.-owned** leading-edge capacity now.
* **“Intel’s problem is tech, not money.”** True that technology is the long pole; equity doesn’t fix process gaps—but it **keeps the option alive**, anchors customers via offtake/price frameworks, and protects prior CHIPS outlays while engineering catches up. (That’s precisely how DoD structured MP Materials.)

# Timeline callout (policy &amp; industry milestones)

* **Mar 20, 2024** — Commerce announces proposed CHIPS funding to Intel (later finalized).
* **Sep 16, 2024** — **Secure Enclave**: up to **$3B** for trusted, leading-edge government chips (DoD/Commerce).
* **Nov 26, 2024** — Intel **final CHIPS award**: up to **$7.865B** direct funding.
* **Q4 2024 / 2025 updates** — **TSMC Arizona**: N4 HVM **Q4’24**; **N3** targeted **2028**; **N2/A16** **late decade**.
* **Mar 3–4, 2025** — **Intel Ohio** slips to **2030–2031** production timing.
* **Apr 29, 2025** — Intel Foundry update: **18A production U.S.-based** (OR first, AZ ramp), packaging roadmap (Foveros/EMIB).
* **Jul 9–10, 2025** — **DoD ↔ MP Materials**: **$400M** convertible preferred + **warrant** (≈**15%** potential), policy template for strategic equity.
* **Aug 2025** — DoD **OSC** executes **$150M loan** to MP for heavy REE separation.
* **Aug 15, 2025** — Admin **floats tariffs up to 300%** on semiconductors; **stake talks** in Intel surface in major outlets.

92,NVDA,China abandoning CUDA?,"There's a blog I follow around China and AI developments, to keep track of what's happening abroad instead of just domestic (I'm in the US). I'm not sure if I can link it here, I'll throw it into a comment just to be safe.

But the gist of it is China has funded a company that is trying to remove CUDA from the equation in the next 18-24 months which means all of the China revenue NVDA would generate would implode and who knows if the tech is cheaper and works better (or marginally worse but still by value is stronger) they could become a dominant player in the chips market.

There are a TON of factors that could either make this more or less legitimate of a concern but I thought it was something to keep an eye on.

**Edit:** oh my comment with the link got removed, DM if you want to read the blog (no stupid paywall).

**Edit2:** I'm seeing a lot of people misunderstanding, China is not trying to out compete NVDA in the market, they are funding a company to develop an alternative to CUDA that would be used inside of China by necessity and thus cut off China as a market for NVDA except for black market but that isn't going to be a very strong revenue source. So it isn't about them building something better to compete with NVDA in the global market.",275,131,1755266889.0,2025-08-15T14:08:09+00:00,t3_1mqywbn,stocks

94,NVDA,I just sold a decent amount of stock..,"32, $890k networth, I decided to be a little manic and sell a good amount of stock today. 

I sold: 

APLD +70%

NBIS +90%

ALAB +150%

RDDT +90%

ONDS +100%

SMCI +10% (small position)

That now puts me at 32% cash, not sure why I'm sharing, just thought I would, I see a lot of repetitive information on here, so I thought I would share something new. 

I also started a position in Dow Chemical, just 100 shares, but yeah

I thought about selling some $HOOD and possibly my $META position, but I've always told myself that those are my lifers, so not sure if I will or not. Might sell some $HOOD tomorrow if it pops when they release their July numbers. 

The list above were all stocks that I sold today. 

Within the last 3 months I've sold

$QQQ +60%

$ARKW +120%

$NVDA +270%

$VRT +40%

$AAPL +40%

Those are slight approximations, I hate how Fidelity doesn't show you the total gain on closed positions, but yeah. 

Not sure what I'll do with the cash, moved most of it to $SGOV, so $175k in $SGOV, 25k in Fidelity that I will slowly buy positions with and then like $87k in Robinhood cash position.

95,NVDA,Best stocks to bet against if you are bearish on AI.,"Aside from the obvious ones like NVDA, MSFT, META, which tickers would be suitable for shorting or buying puts on, if you are bearish on AI and believe we are in a bubble akin to the dot-com boom?

I see that there are two general categories companies can be placed into:

1. Those which actually provide some kind of AI infrastructure/software that other companies are using and paying for. NVDA, MSFT, META are the obvious ones. But this would also include companies like INOD which provide data labeling services that MSFT/META/etc pay for; or data center/chip related companies like APLD, NVTS, SITM

2. Companies which are simply ""using"" AI in some capacity, which may be providing actual value or may be just a gimmick to increase their stock price. For example SOUN, BBAI, CRNC, PYH, ICAD, DUOT.

If you wanted to take a conservative bearish position, I think the best way to do it would be to identify those companies in #2 whose core value proposition does not include AI but who are merely claiming to use AI to ride the AI hype train. However this might be hard to do.

A moderate bearish position would be to short/buy puts on all companies in #2.

A true bearish position would be to short all companies in #1.

346,NVDA,0 to 265k in 2 years on a 100k/yr salary (VHCOL),"25M went from 0 to 265k in exactly 2 years (just completed my 2 year anniversary at work this past week), from my first job straight out of college. I make 100k a year before taxes and live in a VHCOL place. I max out my Roth IRA, 401k and HSA every year expecting long term tax free gains. I transfer all of the money that’s left after paying out my credit cards and rent over to my individual brokerage account. I generally have a high risk appetite but stick to stocks and limit myself to mutual funds or ETFs in my retirement accounts. 

I take home around $6,150 a month after taxes. After deducting my 401k and HSA contributions it’s comes to around $4,000. I keep my living expenses as low as possible (roughly $1,200) since my primary goal is to pile up as much money into my investment accounts as early as possible, so I can relax and spend a little more once I have a family and dependents to care for. Having said that, I try to not let it compromise my lifestyle or take away the things I like doing the most. I travel and go on low-cost budget trips at least 3 times a year while at least making one international trip. The biggest place where I save on is my rent. I pay at least less than half what most of my other friends pay who live in the same area. I live in a flex room (living room converted into a personal spacex/bedroom using curtains/room dividers) in a fancy high rise that has an amazing view overlooking the downtown area and city nearby. This also pushes me to go out of the house more often and explore places around me in the city and meet new people. 

My portfolio consists of mostly Palantir (50%) and some NVIDIA (20%) with some other promising high growth companies. It has returned a staggering 334%. My net worth makes no sense to me given how much I make. I’ve not made anywhere close to what I have now post taxes and expenses. Make it make sense to me. 

Do you all have any recommendations for keeping this pace up and hitting 1 million before I turn 30? ",93,91,1754977396.0,2025-08-12T05:43:16+00:00,t3_1mo0hms,wallstreetbets
383,NVDA,GOOGL is a value buy due to AI,"Yes, this is your weekly Google post!

Google, the company that made LLMs possible with the transformer revolutionary paper. The company that has been valued at 20 PE for many quarters now, even though its peers are at 30ish PE.

LLMs have hit a plateau. Incremental model versions (GPT 5 for example) are not showing incremental gains. If anything, new versions are kind of acting funny as more and more non-LLM characteristics are being added to them to be able to give a deterministic response (how many Rs in a strawberry🍓). We never actually solved “intelligence”, with LLMs, we got a great mimicking machine. So now, LLMs are peaking without the true intelligence (it’s impossible for LLMs with the current science to be truly intelligent).

Guess what improved a shit ton while having billions of daily active users - yes, Google. They integrated LLMs in all their products, although a little slowly. Every product improved, and yet the stock remained in a value territory. They beat every earnings report, give great guidance, hit past the total queries on Google, and still the stock is not as loved as other big tech. They also have the best LLM IMO, Gemini is great.

Unlike ChatGPT, Google doesn’t depend on NVIDIA or other cloud providers for hardware to run LLMs (this is a huge moat). Allowing it to offer cheap LLMs.

I already own 10k worth of Google, and I’m going to 2x it tomorrow. With almost 40k worth of google by the end of September. ",467,219,1754970106.0,2025-08-12T03:41:46+00:00,t3_1mny9at,stocks

96,NVDA,CENTENE (CNC) is a good long term opportunity at this level,"Like every self-respecting Value investor, I've been looking for opportunities to divest from my tech-heavy portfolio. AI Stocks like NVDA, PLTR, MSFT, AMZN, TSLA have done great, but some of these valuations just don't make sense and I don't think now is a good time to buy into them anymore.

That brings me to look for other opportunities. I don't think there's a better opportunity right now than the Healthcare sector.

Historically, Healthcare has outperformed the S&amp;P, thanks to relatively stable stocks like CNC.

Let's take a step back. What the f\*%# happened to this stock in the past 2 months ?

They came out and :

1. Said that their Medical Loss Ratio(MLR) will be much higher because claims are getting expensive
2. Pulled guidance for 2025

Since then, they've had their Q2 Earnings call. They've revised guidance to a EPS of 1.75 for 2025 (from 7.5 previously, ouch). Given that their Q1 2025 EPS was 2.9, and their Q2 EPS was -0.16, this is pricing in a combined -1$ EPS for Q3 and Q4.

The bar is very low. Even a small sign of life from the CEO, could send this stock easily back to the 40 - 50 range, as a path to profitability is starting to be priced into the stock.

The recent headwind, albeit very impactful in the short to medium-term, is temporary. the CEO has said that they have already completed rate re-filings in the 29 states by now, and that the rate decision for each states will be expected in September. The new rates that determine the amount of premiums received, will take into account the high cost for behavioral health(therapists, psychiatric meds etc...),  home health services, and expensive drugs (Wegovy, Ozempic...) .

Compared to the giant UNH, CNC has a much better reputation, isn't under DOJ Investigation, and Ambetter, their Health Insurance Marketplace, has a claims denial rate of 14%, more than half that of UNH.

# Path back to profitability :

CEO and the team are now laser focused on restoring profitability by pulling the necessary levers :

\- identifying and reducing areas where claims have been too ""costly""

\- increasing premium rates, to account for the challenging environment, and with a worst case scenario in mind (continued high morbidity and utilization rate)

\- hinting at a stock buyback in the Earnings call

\- Immune from tariff BS and TACO

# Possible risks

\- The trend of high morbidity and drug use continues to escalate, leading to more people needing expensive surgeries and drugs ==&gt; unlikely, as people who fear that their benefits are being taken away with OBBBA, have already stocked up on drugs/done surgeries

\- continued political pressure on healthcare costs with bills like the OBBBA ==&gt; unlikely, as this bill seems to be a one-and-done on healthcare, and now the Administration will focus on other more pressing matters (Russia - Ukraine conflict, Inflation, crypto, tax bills for the rich etc ...).

Also, this is speculation, but I think the full impact of the OBBBA are wayyy overstated. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that by 2034, 16 million people will lose coverage, but that's a decade away. This will be accounted for in the rate re-pricing.

\- Risks of people changing Insurers because of higher rates ==&gt; given that every Health insurer will be increasing rates, among them: Elevance, UNH, Molina, Blue Cross Blue Shield, CNC will be no exception. People won't switch because none of the other options are better. Centene's health plan is pretty competitive, and compared to Molina health who's the most affordable, Centene's has much better coverage(available across 29 states vs 8 for Molina)

Overall, I think this is a compelling buy, not just for CNC, but for the Health care sector overall, as the benefits greatly outweigh the risk at this point. Historically, the Healthcare Sector has outperformed the S&amp;P, and this is the perfect time to buy in.",20,16,1754865951.0,2025-08-10T22:45:51+00:00,t3_1mmwihz,stocks

August 1 close at 6,238.01 - August 8 close at 6,389.45 🟢 (2.43%)

🔸 Monday: After Friday's selloff, the stock market attempted a rebound and opened higher around 0.5%. Before the session, Trump said will announce new statistician in next 3-4 days. But, it has not been announced yet. Second important topic was India's tariffs due to oil purchases from Russia. Trump continued to threaten to raise tariffs. The interest rate cut possibility in September is getting stronger, so the stock market had spent positive day. 🟢

🔸 Tuesday: Before the session, Trump made two important announcements. The first one was about China. He said we're getting very close to a deal, but it still just a verbal statement yet. The second one was Bessent declined consideration for Fed Chair. Bessent wants to stay where he is. The session opened higher. During the session, ISM services data was released and weaker than expected results pulled to down on the stock market. The S&amp;P 500 closed lower 0.5%. 🔴

🔸 Wednesday: Before the session, the news flow was quiet. Trump said will decide on Fed Governor decision in this week. The stock market opened higher. During the session, U.S. announced to impose 25% tariffs on Indian imports starting August 27. India said additional tariffs are ""Unfair, unjustified, unreasonable"". Despite this, the stock market closed higher. 🟢

🔸 Thursday: Initial jobless claims data came 226K and it's highest level for 4-week. It's slightly negative. Outside the U.S., Bank of England had been cut rates to 4% from 4.25%. The stock market opened higher. On the other hand, Gold reached critical levels at $3,400. Lutnick said U.S. likely to extend China deadline for another 90 days. It seems that China will continue a main topic in 2025. The market lost opening earnings after Governor Christopher Waller has emerged as a leading candidate to replace Jerome Powell. Trump signed order allowing private equity about 401(k). Also, Trump said 100% tariff on all semiconductors coming in to U.S. It was a busy day. The stock market closed mixed. The Nasdaq ended higher. The S&amp;P 500 closed lower, but it's only 0.06%. 🔴

🔸 Friday: Trump announced Stephen Miran will replace outgoing governor Adriana Kugler until Jan. 31, 2026. The stock market opened higher. The session was quiet. Nasdaq closed at a new all-time high. 🟢

There was no major economic data this week. ISM services made some volatility on Tuesday, but it was limited. I'm happy to turned from around 6,200 because I would close my trading positions if the S&amp;P 500 closed below the previous high of 6,147. Our next target will be highest level 6,427. I believe that we may not break in first attempt. I still expect a bit volatility in August. After the September, I'm still optimistic.

168,NVDA,"$600,000 $AMD call option trade + $1.2m hedge","TLDR: AMD finally caught up to NVDA, the market doesn’t realize, go giga long $AMD. 

Buy $TLT just incase market crashes so you don’t blow your account up in a black swan, or if thesis is wrong. 


Trade Setup:
	•	33% Portfolio: AMD calls 12/17/27, $360 strike (111% out of the money as of today)
	•	66% Portfolio: $TLT shares (U.S. Treasury bonds)

$AMD Thesis In A Nutshell:

$NVDA market cap: $4.4T
$AMD market cap: $270B

The world is in a massive race to get more chips, and NVDA looks on track for a $10T market cap.

For the first time starting this quarter, AMD’s MI355X is on par with NVDA, with cheaper chips. Sam Altman promoted the MI400 and MI450 at an AI event earlier this year. Hyperscaler consensus is that they are testing the MI350 this year to get familiar with integrating AMD into their data centers, so they will be ready to place big orders next year for the rack scale MI400 and MI450. This was noted on the most recent earnings call.

From here on, AMD’s chips will be on par, if not better, than NVDA for inference, which both Jensen Huang and Sam Altman agree will grow 1000x+ from current demand levels. Jensen said this on the GP2 podcast interview.

In 2024, AMD did $12B in data center revenue with inferior chips, while NVDA did $115B. If AMD can do $55B in 2027, which is half of NVDA’s 2024 data center revenue, it is easily a $1T company, or an $800 stock.

Everything suggests AMD will have a competitive product at a competitive price point, with demand setting up to be off the charts in 2026 and 2027, similar to NVDA’s neck breaking 2023 and 2024 growth rates of 100%+.

Second Leg Of Trade:

If there is a recession or a black swan event, the Fed will cut rates and send TLT soaring, making up for a $0 AMD option. This is a simple hedge against a Covid style scenario.

Best Case:
	•	TLT gains 50% to 100% from rate cuts on 66% of my portfolio
	•	AMD 4x in 2.5 years from AI chip demand, with calls returning 20x on 33% of my portfolio

Base Case:
	•	AMD calls go to $0 if NVDA outcompetes AMD like in past AI failures such as MI300
	•	TLT rises as rates come down, which recovers the call premiums and results in break even in about 2.5 years

Worst Case:
	•	AMD calls go to $0
	•	TLT drops because inflation spikes, resulting in a 30% loss there as well. This is unlikely in my opinion but possible.

MI350X and MI355X should already drive healthy growth for AMD. However, MI400 will be the real game changer because of its scalability. AMD already raised the price for MI350, which just went into production, to $25,000 per chip. MI400 will be a true rack scale solution, making it highly competitive for large cluster projects.

**EPS: $1.03**, Up $0.01 (Increased Revenue)  


# A New Challenger in GPT5:

[Headline Estimates from GPT5](https://preview.redd.it/y7h3eiw0cuhf1.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9332c28885bdbec364be95f7efe16ecefe3d122)

I fed my previous posts to GPT5 (they're on Reddit anyway) and prompted it to come up with its own estimates. The above image shows the headline projections from GPT and its bullish estimates prompted me to ask for a segment breakdown. 

[Revenue by Segment and EPS](https://preview.redd.it/5ut7zj4ccuhf1.png?width=1562&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66f3898cf08e8c71f25064cd9611a61cb05ef3c3)

GPT5 is expecting strong numbers from NVDA's Data Center Segment, while its Gaming and Prof. Visualization estimates are lower than mine. GPT5 is slightly more bullish Robo &amp; Auto than I am.   


# The Estimates Stacked Up:

[GPT5 noted this as a fair way to represent their estimates](https://preview.redd.it/9u6xxt9wcuhf1.png?width=1756&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6270483896b29093ca5d80ac7db2f1f61adb0c3)

This is what the three estimates look like stacked against each other, and it now offers a wide range of perspectives. Analyst consensus is almost always conservative (going on 3 consecutive years of beats), so comparing my detailed analysis to a likely-sandbagged estimate is hardly fair. Since AI is supposed to take my job as an analyst, let's see how the actuals compare.  


# Positions:

Still in my 200 shares and ATM (Bit ITM now) Covered Calls, looking to manage in September or October.   


[$175 Calls at around 0.60 Delta Early August](https://preview.redd.it/4ioivgxjeuhf1.jpg?width=1179&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f834007b66898571302f5691d4b081a1c1ea39d)



# TLDR:

\- My Estimates Increased Slightly to $1.03 EPS on $46.4 Billion in Revenue  
\- Leaning into AI Criticism by Introducing GPT5 as an Analyst to Compare to  
\- Three estimates range in aggressiveness (AI then Me then Analyst Consensus)

121,NVDA,there is 100% a bubble. They hit a wall and are lying. GPT-5 isn’t a brain; it’s a router. AI hype is peaking. What’s your Monday play?,"TL;DR: AGI isn’t here. GPT-5 feels like autocomplete with better plumbing. Costs stay high, gains are flattening, and the market priced in a thinking god. If upgrades underwhelm, multiples compress. What are you trading Monday?

Why I think the hype is topping
	•	“Router, not mind.” It chains tools/APIs, routes prompts, and dresses it up as magic. Cool? Yes. General intelligence? No.
	•	Diminishing returns. Each new model = smaller real-world lift vs. 2023’s jump.
	•	Expensive to run. Inference bills bite; enterprises throttle usage or cap features.
	•	Messy in production. Hallucinations, latency, compliance — pilots ≠ scale.
	•	Narrative &gt; numbers. Valuations assume AGI-level growth; reality is “assistive software.”

Market angle (discussion, not advice)
	•	Most exposed: “AI-wrapped” SaaS with thin moats and GPU-dependence; picks-and-shovels priced for perfection.
	•	Safer side: Cash-gushing boring names; vendors selling non-AI painkillers; pairs trades (short story stocks / long cash flow).
	•	What’s your high-conviction Monday play?
	•	Hedging with puts on AI darlings?
	•	Pairs trade: short hype, long cash machine?
	•	Event play: calendars into the next model keynote?
	•	Or you think I’m wrong and it’s buy-the-dip season — make the bull case.

Prove me wrong challenge: Name one GPT-5 capability that materially drops unit costs or unlocks net-new revenue at scale that GPT-4 couldn’t. I’ll read every comment.

Not financial advice. I have the smoothest brain on this sub. Post your positions, roast me, and drop tickers so we can all farm tendies.

Suggested Plays

1. Long: AI Infrastructure Enablers
	•	Nvidia (NVDA) — market leader in AI chips; stocks are at record highs due to GPT‑5 demand and expansion (e.g., Tesla’s shift to Nvidia chips) ￼.
	•	Nebius (NBIS) — AI cloud provider surging after blowout Q2 and raised revenue guidance (625% YoY revenue growth, targeting ~$1B revenue) ￼.

2. Short/Neutral: Pure-play AI hype vehicles
	•	Avoid or short names riding on GPT‑5 euphoria without real infrastructure exposure or clear margin expansion. Betting markets already down on OpenAI relative to Google; sentiment is fragile.

Composite Position: Pairs Trade
	•	Go long momentum and infrastructure (e.g., NVDA, NBIS).
	•	Go neutral or short pure hype (e.g., GPT‑centric startups lacking scale or defensibility).",662,209,1754671109.0,2025-08-08T16:38:29+00:00,t3_1ml04uw,SmallStreetBets
385,NVDA,You don’t own enough Google- Another “Google is undervalued” post,"OpenAI just released their frontier model and suffice to say… it flopped. 

People are waiting with bated breath to see what Google has cooked up. They already released Genie 3, which nobody is even close to yet on world models. I think it will be trivial for them to surpass or at least catch up to OpenAI on the intelligence front for frontier LMM. And they have always been better than other AI companies from a context length and cost perspective. 

Just from an AI front, Google is killing it. Their narrow AI is winning Nobel prizes with Alphafold. Discovering algorithms with AlphaEvolve. Advancing robotics. 

Even if you don’t think Google will win the AI race to general intelligence or don’t even believe anyone will get there (which is the long term “this stock will absolutely explode if they hit AGI” bet):


let’s just look at valuations:

If OpenAI is valued at $500b then Deepmind is easily $500b. 

If Netflix is $500b then Youtube is easily $700b. 

Search is easily $1-2T. 

Now we are sitting around Googles current $2.5T valuation. 

But there’s more! 

How much is Google Cloud worth? Easily $300+ billion just based on current revenue. 

This is part of cloud but how much is their tensor chip tech alone worth? AI specific compute that’s competitive to Nvidia? Short answer is: a lot. 

If Tesla is worth $1T partly off self driving car hype, how much is Waymo worth? Easily $100-200b. 

How much is the Android/Google Play business worth? 

How much is every app that we all use daily worth? (Chrome, Maps, Gmail, Docs, Drive, etc)


I know this has been said before but Google is literally a competitor to every single major Tech companies business. They have their hands in every single pot. Whilst, they have historically had issues with marketing and selling their product, their product suite *is good*. They don’t just have a useless competitor like bing is to their search, they actually put up real competition like Google Docs is to Word. 

People talk about the risk of Google getting broken up but that might be the best thing for investors. The individual parts of Google are so valuable that forcing the market to value them separately might actually unlock value. It wouldn’t be crazy if a breakup made investors richer, not poorer (at least in the short term). The market would finally have to pull its head out of its ass and price these pieces properly. (Edit: This part is hyperbole to make a point, I don’t actually think a breakup would be good for investors) ",875,414,1754669579.0,2025-08-08T16:12:59+00:00,t3_1mkzgmj,stocks

131,NVDA,"If PLTR goes to become $1T from here, you will gain only 100%","What would you do -

Bought when it was $8/9. At this point, my cost basis is 0 because I also made more by selling covered calls than I invested in PLTR stock. So, as I have nothing left to lose on PLTR out of pocket, I am trying to figure out whether and how to exit.

So....

If PLTR grows to become $1T from here, the gain from here would just be 100%.

The valuation is so rich, that continued growth in revenue will be required at much higher rate than what NVDA had during its bull run ( from $400 to $1T was done between 2022 to 2023). Some data pulled by chatgpt -

.

**And if 'AI' is the reason for PLTR's bull run, it seems highly valued compared to that of NVDA during same phase.**

At this point, it has started to make sense to book profit and reinvest in future dips. That's my reasoning based only on simple SP and growth numbers.

Any other longs contemplating this ? What's your theory if you have decided to exit/continue to hold at current SP ?

Also, if you are thinking to buy PLTR NOW, what's your theory and what are your realistic expectations?

not advice. dyor.

Edit - Update. I exited 90% and keeping 10% in PLTR. Also, have a **speculative small position** in PLTZ (inverse/short 2x PLTR), going to keep adding upto certain limit only and then hold. Will eat up some of my realized profit from PLTR, but it ""feels"" :) PLTZ can likely give 100%+ sometime in the future. Just a speculation. Not advice.

Let’s see why this could be a good profit opportunity. Thesis:

NVIDIA developed the H20 chip for the Chinese market after the U.S. bans, but in April this year, new restrictions came into effect that blocked exports of the H20 to China, causing billion-dollar losses (inventory write-off). In July, the U.S. government relaxed the restrictions, but China raised concerns about the chip's security (backdoors?), creating uncertainty.  
As if that weren't enough, Trump announced new tariffs on semiconductors yesterday morning. The POTUS will definitely keep talking nonsense from now until August 27, so implied volatility is likely to rise.

Positions:

* 1x 5SEP 190C 4.99
* 1x 5SEP 165P 3.83

IV under 50% at the moment

The strategy is to exit as soon as there’s a significant profit. If I hit +30%, I’ll exit immediately, otherwise I’ll close the position right before earnings regardless.

Note: I’m not recommending this trade – you could lose the capital invested.

125,NVDA,"Nvidia on Tuesday rejected Chinese accusations that its data center GPUs for artificial intelligence include a hardware function that could remotely deactivate the chips, which is commonly called a “kill switch.”","“NVIDIA GPUs do not and should not have kill switches and backdoors,” wrote Nvidia’s Chief Security Officer David Reber in a blog post on Tuesday.

The blog post comes after the Cyberspace Administration of China said last week that it needed Nvidia to provide documents about what it called security vulnerabilities in the H20, Nvidia’s data center AI chip intended for the Chinese market. The regulator specifically mentioned “backdoor” security risks, according to the New York Times.

The H20 generates billions in revenue per quarter for Nvidia in sales, although the company does not typically break out its revenue specifically. The chip was briefly banned from export to China in April.

The company said its guidance would have been about $8 billion higher except for lost sales from a recent export restriction on its China-bound H20 chips.

The Trump administration said in July that it would grant a waiver for the chips to resume sales.

Silicon Valley technologists and security experts generally believe that backdoors — when a device has a hidden function that would allow a government or attacker to secretly take data from a computer or otherwise control it — are untenable in products.

Apple, in particular, has publicly fought off government requests for what it calls “backdoors” in the past as well.

Earnings per share: 16 cents adj. vs. 14 cents expected

Revenue: $1.00 billion vs. $940 million expected

The artificial intelligence software provider’s revenues grew 48% during the period. Analysts hadn’t expected the $1 billion revenue benchmark from the Denver-based company until the fourth quarter of this year.

“We’re planning to grow our revenue ... while decreasing our number of people,” CEO Alex Karp told CNBC’s Morgan Brennan in an interview. “This is a crazy, efficient revolution. The goal is to get 10x revenue and have 3,600 people. We have now 4,100.”

135,NVDA,Where is the promised chaos in the market ?,"Hello everyone,

In January, China triggered a red Monday by announcing DeepSeek, an AI that’s far cheaper and more efficient. Ultimately, retail investors poured a record amount of money into the stock market, playing the ""dip"" with Nvidia in particular.  
  
In February, when Donald Trump began announcing tariffs, the market started to tremble, with each announcement leading to ""red"" days. Yet, retail investors once again saved the market by buying the dip.  
  
On April 3, retail investors were nowhere to be found. Analysts warned that these tariffs would cripple the US market, and a trade war would paralyze the world. Tensions with China escalated.  
  
Trump backtracked on his stance with China, though he’s tempted to gradually increase tariffs on them. But for the rest of the world, as of today, no major changes. Weaker, sure, but still elevated.

Yet, we still don’t see chaos in the US economy. Corporate earnings, across all sectors, are very strong, beating expectations. Indicators show a resilient US economy.

Today, retail investors seem to have more and more money to pour into the market. Institutional investors are finally starting to follow the trend. The President of JP Morgan, who went on every platform to say the market was horrible and scary, revealed that his bank made a fortune investing in the stock market...

Still, many analysts predicted that August would be the month when indices would crash because they’ve risen too high, too fast...",203,256,1754357727.0,2025-08-05T01:35:27+00:00,t3_1mhw3xa,StockMarket

101,NVDA,Analyst bullish on Palantir stock before earnings,"Wedbush reiterated an outperform rating and a price target of $160 for Palantir stock ahead of its earnings, according to a recent research note.

Analysts led by Daniel Ives said the recent deal with the U.S. Army represents an additional tailwind, which places Palantir in the sweet spot to benefit from ""a tidal wave of federal spending on AI.""

""We continue to believe that Palantir’s unique AI software approach will be a positive growth catalyst as governments look to further increase efficiency with more software/lower headcount,"" Ives wrote.

Besides, I also have a personal watchlist, any opinion is welcomed.

347,NVDA,"ALL IN and Max Margins on SMCI !! My Rent Money, Dog's Eye Surgery Fund, Jacked to the Tits!  Either A5 or Instantaneous Ramen","**DD/TLDR Rocket Reason**

1. NVIDIA and all big tech are customers
2. 20% short interest - presumably because of financial reporting fears. SMCI went from 3 million shares short a quarter ago to 95 million shares short now (Fintel). I know finance and this is no longer a problem. SMCI clearly announced they Do Not Need to restate earnings and their auditors found no instances of fraud (given US laws, you don’t casually declare this on an earnings call). 
3. Meeting or even slightly beating earnings will squeeze the shorts’ balls blue. OPEN had a short interest of 20.73%, look what happened when it squeezed.
4. Massive expected INCREASE in AI spend. Ex: Recent Google earnings announced increase to $85 billion. X (Grok) working to launch millions of GPUs and shipping a “power plant” from Europe to power it. Every AI player (MSFT, META, AMZN, Open AI etc) will do the same increasing spend to the 70-90bill range. TSMC also reported great earnings. Clear sign demand is accelerating not slowing.
5. International expansion - SMCI won a Major Exclusive $20 billion DataVolt (Saudi Arabia) deal, Ericsson.
6. Raised 2.3 billion cash and sold 1.79 billion in receivables for expansion. Big-brain move at 0% interest with capped calls. They are currently generating cash and not burning it, which means the money is primarily for planned massive growth and expansion.
7. BofA Analist Ruplu Bhattacharya, has a $35 price target on SMCI, but had a price target of $1,090 at one point, which is a ridiculous joke. Big funds probably have major short positions and are now caught with their pants down and are using their Analist to beat prices down. They don’t know computers. If SMCI reports spectacular earnings on 8/5/2025, and their tits get squeezed, she’ll be relegated to OnlyFans.",619,247,1754262152.0,2025-08-03T23:02:32+00:00,t3_1mgxblh,wallstreetbets

July 28, 2025 – August 1, 2025","First of all, I don't want to be misunderstood. This heat map is weekly that it visualized via closing prices from July 25 to August 1.

I had 18-week streak in Week Recap, but I took a break the last 2-week. Now, it's time for a fresh start 😀

We know that August 1 is the tariff deadline, so we can wait to high volality. As expected, the stock market closed the week in negative. The S&amp;P 500 made 4-day losing streak.

📊 Here are the S&amp;P 500's week-by-week results for the last 4 week,

July 3 close at 6,279.35 - July 11 close at 6,259.75 🔴 (-0.31%)

July 11 close at 6,259.75 - July 18 close at 6,296.79 🟢 (0.59%)

July 25 close at 6,388.64 - August 1 close at 6,238.01 🔴 (-2.36%)

🔸 Monday: This week started with good news from EU that U.S. reached a trade deal. EU will purchase $750B worth of energy and invest $600B more than previously planned. The stock market opened mixed. The S&amp;P 500 was lower, but Nasdaq was higher. During the session, Morgan Stanley's Wilson predicted 7,200 by Mid-2026. Also, Oppenheimer raised year end target to 7,100 from 5,950. The stock market closed slightly higher. 🟢

🔸 Tuesday: The most important event was FOMC meeting in this week. Before the FOMC, the stock market opened flat. Job openings data released and fell by 275,000 to 7.437 million. Job market was weak in July. On the other hand, consumer confidence jumped 95.2 to 97.2 in July. It is still weak, but it is higher the lowest level in March. The U.S. and China have agreed to extend tariff truce, but it wasn't enough to lift. The stock market closed lower. 🔴

🔸 Wednesday: Before the session, Q2 GDP was released and came at 3.0%. Q1 was -0.5%. It's a positive sign and the stock market opened higher. During the session, FOMC meeting completed and interest rates unchanged as expected. Powell said we have made no decisions about September meeting. However, CME FedWatch tool is showing 80% possibility of 25 point rate cut in September. The stock market closed lower again. 🔴

🔸 Thursday: Before the session, Fed's favorite economic indicator that Core PCE inflation was released. Previous month data was revised to 2.8% year-over-year. July data is same as June and expectations. On the other hand, Microsoft and Meta released their earnings on Wednesday. The stocks smashed the expectations. The stock market opened higher. During the session, tariffs concerns dropped the indexes and the stock market closed lower. 🔴

🔸 Friday: And, August 1 arrived. The unemployment rate rose in July. The stock market opened lower. Tariffs on Canada were increased from 25% to 35%. Many countries were impacted this increments because they did not reach any agreement yet. Trump announced the new tariffs will start August 7. The stock market closed lower. Also, he fires head of labor statistics. The S&amp;P 500 dropped 1.60% and it's highest single day drop since May 21. 🔴

We were in a good rally, but tariff concerns cut again. While a few countries have agreed, many are still in negotiations or something. Also, job market did not help to lift as Powell. I think, 6,400 might be highest level for a while. After the September, I'm still optimistic.

394,NVDA,AMD is evolving from a chip supplier to a full-fledged AI computing platform player,"The MI350 is close enough to Nvidia's performance that AMD can finally charge something closer to a premium price. This chip is no longer just an affordable alternative - it's being used in real-world, mission-critical AI workloads. Most importantly, this is the “early inflection point” in the changing competitive landscape you've been watching.



Revenue and margin gains are real 

At higher average selling prices, AMD has been able to grow significantly without having to dramatically increase volume. Even the relatively low volume of the MI350 ($25K) is likely to boost Q3 and Q4 results, especially considering that they will be compared to a period when China's exports were hit hard. Margins could also improve: shifting more of the GPU portfolio to higher-end SKUs will help close AMD's earnings gap with Nvidia and Broadcom - which still limits AMD's P/E ratio.



The market expects AMD's GPU revenue to be around $1.65 billion in the third quarter. If MI355X grows as expected in the second half of the year and prices move in line with expectations, AMD's revenue could be revised upward.



Major customers could be behind this move 

AMD wouldn't be pressing prices so aggressively unless major cloud service providers such as Meta ( META ) and Oracle ( ORCL ) were on board. There is growing evidence that these customers are no longer just interested in AMD's GPUs, but are actually actively deploying them. We saw early signs of this in our Q1 earnings call and earnings filings. Customers appear to be buying AMD's complete AI platform, including ROCm, system integration and long-term support.



AMD vs. Nvidia: The Price Gap is Narrowing 

Even at $25K, the MI350 is less expensive than Nvidia's B200, making AMD an attractive choice for workloads such as inference, especially among enterprises and second-tier cloud service providers that can't justify Nvidia's pricing. This creates an optimal balance of “value and performance,” and AMD is helping to lead the way in certain market segments. This marks a significant shift in the competitive landscape.



Risks remain, but the narrative is changing 

Headwinds remain. China's export restrictions could result in a revenue reduction of \~$800 million in the second half of 2025, and it is unclear if or when licenses will resume. mi355x needs to be released smoothly and continue the momentum of mi350 - any issues with the software or system will be closely watched. rocm is still lagging behind CUDA in developer adoption. Still lagging behind CUDA in terms of adoption, but improving: ROCm now offers day one support for LLaMA 4 and there are over 2 million models optimized for AMD GPUs on Hugging Face.



Overall 

This indicates a shift in AMD's strategy. It supports our broader view that the company is no longer confined to the role of low-cost alternative, but is moving towards leadership in AI computing. If these pricing trends continue - and especially if they trigger even a modest “ahead-of-the-curve” cycle - the market may begin to reassess AMD as less of a traditional chipmaker and more of a AMD as less of a traditional chipmaker and more of a platform company. As these fundamentals strengthen, the technological breakthroughs we've seen from AMD, especially relative to NVIDIA, could begin to gain real staying power.",105,34,1754059016.0,2025-08-01T14:36:56+00:00,t3_1mey6ge,stocks
395,NVDA,"The most overlooked, undervalued, recession proof, opportunity in this macro environment: $EZPW","**Something big happened Wednesday night and nobody’s talking about it.**

EZCORP ($EZPW), of all companies, posted a stealthy *double beat*: earnings up 33.6%, revenue up 2.8%. No flashy branding, no AI, no datacenter capital burn. Just... pawnshops.

This is a company built on *short-term credit* and *collateralized lending*. And while everyone’s been watching Nvidia, this pawn empire (with operations across the U.S. and Latin America) is quietly riding the wave of inflation, tighter credit, and gold appreciation.

**Macro tailwinds: tighter credit environment, inflation and gold price**

The Fed's not cutting rates. Credit card APRs are soaring 25%+. Inflation is likely rising. Subprime borrowers are getting squeezed harder than a lime at a Mezcal tasting. Enter EZCORP. In short: banks are saying “no,” and EZCORP is saying “show me your gold chain.”

These are **non-recourse loans**. No bank account required, no credit checks. Just cash on the spot. It’s old-school lending but scaled. EZCORP now runs **1,284 stores**, including Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras.

And here’s the kicker: the **average U.S. loan** they give out is up to **$207**, from $185 last year, partly because gold prices are climbing. That means more revenue per transaction, backed by assets they can resell

# Q2 FY25: EZCORP’s quiet blowout

|Metric|Q2 FY25|YoY Growth|
|:-|:-|:-|
||
|Revenue|$318.9M|\+12%|
|Pawn Loans Outstanding (PLO)|$271.8M|\+15%|
|EBITDA|$45.1M|\+23%|
|EPS (diluted)|$0.34|\+21%|
|Merchandise Sales|$177.4M|\+8%|
|Gross Profit|$185.0M|\+10%|
|Cash on Balance Sheet|505.2M|Up 3x QoQ|

And yet? **Wall Street barely blinked.**  
Yes - the stock is up 8%, but still it's a very cheap business, if we are considering the valuations...

* EPS (annualized): \~$1.36
* PEG ratio (15% est. growth): **0.73**
* Forward P/E: \~10.5
* Analyst PT: **$21-$22**
* Current price: \~$14.32
* **Implied upside: \~47%**

Assumptions:

* FCF starting point: $107.6M (TTM) *NOTE: Strong YoY growth of* ***+232%***  *driven by both operational efficiency and the refinancing event in Q2 FY25.*
* Growth: 10% (5 years), Terminal: 3%
* WACC: 9%
* Diluted shares outstanding: 83.1M

→ **Fair Value Estimate: ± $20.5/share**

Even under conservative assumptions, this stock trades at a **meaningful discount to intrinsic value**.

# Short interest: quietly squeezable?

* **Short Float:** 17.96%
* **Short Interest:** 8.89M shares
* **Days to Cover:** 9.36
* **Short Shares Available:** Just 1.7M

# Charting the breakout: RSI, Channel, and Volume say Yes

On the **monthly chart**, EZPW has:

* Held a long-term **uptrend channel** since 2020
* Shown **bullish divergence** on RSI
* Seen **increased volume and positive MACD crossover**
* Strong support around $12.50–13.00
* Key resistance ahead at \~$15.80 and $21.00

The setup is textbook: consistent higher lows, a bullish RSI trendline, and increasing conviction.

**Institutional confidence + smart money quietly accumulating**

While EZCORP doesn’t make headlines, it does sit in portfolios run by **BlackRock (owns ± 15.7%), Vanguard (owns ±5.9%), and Dimensional Fund Advisors (± owns 6.7)**. Together they hold a substantial interest in the business of ±28%. On top, recent repurchases by management (albeit modest) signal quiet confidence, and the company still sits under most radar screens. A value trap for shorts, and a value *play* for those with a spine.

**Scaling the unsexy way: EZCORP’s inner Costco**

Pawnshops aren’t new. But scaling a pawn *empire* across Latin America? That’s innovation via *distribution*. EZCORP has added **44 new stores YoY**, including 9 de novo LatAm locations and 1 acquisition.

What’s more impressive:

* 6.2M EZ+ Rewards users, up 34%
* 25% growth in online luxury sales via **Max Pawn eBay channel**
* 30% of U.S. stores now offer “view online, buy in-store”
* 15% jump in layaways after launching longer terms

Like **Costco**, EZCORP focuses on **volume, repeat traffic, and margin control**. Just with Rolexes instead of rotisserie chickens.

# Final words: great entry

EZCORP isn’t riding a hype cycle. It’s riding the *macro reality* that millions of people are financially squeezed and need fast, dignified access to cash. EZCORP is the kind of business that thrives when the economy doesn’t. Worth a look.

It’s a profitable, cash-rich business, growing smartly in emerging markets, sitting on a short interest keg, and trading at a discount. What’s not to like?

**✔ PEG &lt; 1**  
**✔ Cash-rich, debt-refinanced**  
**✔ Short-squeeze setup**  
**✔ Long-term macro tailwind**  
**✔ Undervalued vs. peers**

Enjoy the pawnside of capitalism.

103,NVDA,GOOG - when will it take off?,"I’ve been slowly and steadily investing in GOOG - by looking at the books, it looks like a strong performer. Over the last few years, I’ve invested around $20K in it. The returns are not as staggering as other Mag 7 - it’s one of the worst performer of my portfolio. Still at 50% absolute gains, but dwarfed by how other Mag 7 grew in that period. Eg: Meta, MSFT, Amazon and of course our beloved NVDA. 

So, want to know from this group  - when do you think this stock will take off? And any particular reason (apart from anti-trust) why it has not already happened?

348,NVDA,A Carvana Bear Case,"Hi, I don't like Carvana, and think it is massively overvalued. They shot up to an all time high of $385 after their most recent earnings report, and I wanted to post my thesis on why Carvana is worth shorting. Before we get into it, I **am** biased against Carvana, I **do** have puts on Carvana, and those puts **are** losing money. It's cool, I'm not mad. I'm definitely not mad. This is partially for my own edification and research, but hopefully you find it useful as well!

If you would like a professional opinion first, then before reading what I have to say, you may want to check out is [this report](https://hindenburgresearch.com/carvana/) on Carvana from Hindenburg. They had a similar short position and wrote their own bear case for Carvana. I think they made some salient points which have highlighted problems which have actually been getting WORSE since writing that report.

For me, I took a look at their[ most recent Earnings report](https://otp.tools.investis.com/clients/us/carvana/SEC/sec-show.aspx?Type=page&amp;FilingId=18649181-55571-322427&amp;CIK=0001690820&amp;Index=11000), as well as their [previous earnings report in May](https://otp.tools.investis.com/clients/us/carvana/SEC/sec-show.aspx?Type=page&amp;FilingId=18442840-44193-290080&amp;CIK=0001690820&amp;Index=11000).

https://preview.redd.it/w5zvkn56m8gf1.png?width=2023&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=803df496e15ff034862222302f584b01f297026d

Compared to last quarter, Carvana holds 520 million more in cars in inventory (the total value of all their cars). Their total assets have increased by 488 million. Which means they have reduced their assets by 32 million in the process of acquiring these cars. And to add my own interpretation, Carvana will buy cars often without regard to quality. There is a distinct possibility that a portion of these will sit unsold for the entirety of the company's existence. Nevertheless they count these cars as assets. According to Kelley blue book, ""On average, *new cars depreciate about 30% over the first 2 years*, and continue to depreciate 8-12% each year after that."" So even in the generous interpretation that all of these cars are sellable assets, the cars they are sitting on are only getting less valuable over time.

https://preview.redd.it/xodu17wmm8gf1.png?width=2027&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c1c56bc12cb747d5213da4edf530c8c4eec508c

But are they selling all these additional cars? On a positive note, their gross profits are up by 135 million, however once operating expenses are considered, their net income was actually down by 67 million. Net income for this quarter was 308 million, down from 373 million last quarter. This is primarily due to a 117 million increase in operating expenses.

Their liabilities have increased by 144 million. Increasing in every category across the board. When we subtract their liabilities from their assets, Carvana's equity was 1.773 billion last quarter, and 2.117 billion this quarter, increasing by 344 million. Which is less than their increase in car value. You may interpret this as an investment in high quality inventory. Or, you may interpret this to mean that they are converting themselves into a rotting graveyard of used cars. Your choice.

Regarding loans, Carvana originates car loans and then sells them to partners. They do this through forward flow agreements and fixed pool loan sales. These are blind boxes of car loans and are essentially the auto industry version of a Mortgage Backed Security, which I'm sure you remember from the 2008 financial crisis. That is NOT to suggest Carvana is going to somehow cause a financial crisis, just to add context and highlight that these are some risky sub-prime loans. Last quarter they sold 800 million in fixed pool loan sales, this quarter they sold 1.2 billion. A 50% increase.

https://preview.redd.it/8lwn6scdm8gf1.png?width=641&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=efc99f4e49c9ad8cd256c31c5f05dbc1151bdb73

You may have heard that over the course of this year, auto loan delinquencies are on the rise. LendingTree says 5.1% of Americans with Auto loans are delinquent as of this month. Carvana sells their loans, so is this relevant? Well, if Carvana's loans are a product they aim to sell, and that product is reducing in value, I think that could certainly reduce their sales. And that has been happening. Car loan company Ally has reduced their dealings with Carvana. And Carvana has been increasingly relying on these sales as a key element of their income, ""Almost 26% of Carvana’s gross profit consisted of sales of customer auto loans to third parties"" according to Hindenburg, and it's only gotten worse.

**The Grift**

If we can imagine a world where Carvana is worth $400, I think I can take a moment to imagine a world where they're bankrupt. Because they almost were, and may still be headed there, despite earnings reports. This part is more speculative, so feel free to ignore it, but the report I mentioned earlier from Hindenburg talks about Carvana's many issues which I highlighted above, and eludes to some unsavory business practices which may or may not be going on below the surface. And these are the kind of practices that wont increase your shareholder value, unfortunately.

A big one the report highlights is Carvana's relationship with DriveTime, a company owned by the founder's father. A large portion of Carvana's car sales are allegedly made to DriveTime, a used car company. The report also notes several instances when DriveTime's founder, the dad, has made a total of at least 5 billion from selling Carvana shares at the elevated price.

Hindenburg suggests, ""Carvana appears to be dumping unreported costs of extended warranties onto related-party DriveTime, resulting in artificially inflated revenue and profitability. We estimate Carvana reports \~58% more warranty income per sale due to the relationship.""

What could be happening here is that Carvana is offloading unsellable cars to DriveTime in exchange for dad's cut of Carvana. But at some time in the future DriveTime will declare bankruptcy and Carvana will be unable to continue inflating their numbers.

Is this believable? Well Hindenburg also states that the father and owner of DriveTime previously ""pled guilty to felony bank fraud over allegations that he helped a company report fake accounting income through sham transactions. SEC charges also alleged he “signed a falsified letter for \[the company’s\] auditors."" So this could literally just be the dad repeating his past grift after getting caught in his last venture. And shareholders may be the ones being grifted.

The other issue is with loan sales. Given Ally's reduced business, how has Carvana continued to offload their subprime auto loans? Maybe they haven't. According to Hindenburg, ""In the past two quarters, Carvana sold $800 million in loans to an “unrelated third party.” The mystery buyer made up 18.3% and 16.3% of total loan sales in Q2 and Q3 2024""

I can't verify this, as it is shrouded in secrecy. The report implies that the loans are being sold to ""Cerberus Capital, where Carvana Director Dan Quayle is Chairman of Global Investments""

And on top of that, they also make the allegation that ""Carvana’s loans held on its books have increased 50% since 2021, to $553 million in Q3 2024. Carvana uses an accounting treatment that records no loss reserves on these loans at booking""

So they aren't actually able to offload all of these toxic assets, even to Cerberus Capital, and at some point, this will come tumbling down. It wont bring the stock market with it like in the 2008 financial crisis, but Carvana themselves would certainly go bankrupt. If you aren't going to sell, at LEAST set a stop loss.

**Valuation**

Leaving the very plausible bankruptcy question out of the equation, let's consider Price to earnings based SOLELY on what was actually reported. Carvana stock's biggest issue right now is its extremely distorted valuation.

To compare, let's look at a reasonable competitor, Carmax. Carmax sells used cars online. Carmax also sells car loans. It's also a dinosaur, one I would not personally look at or even think about if not for this post. But here goes.

|For Most Recent Quarter|Share Price|Earnings (EBIT)|Earnings Per Share|Price to Earnings (ttm)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Carvana|$385|308 Million|$1.28|117.81|
|Carmax|$58|283 Million|$1.38|16.38|

As you can see, Carmax looks to be a better earner than Carvana. And no, I dont think Carmax is the one being incorrectly valued.

To be thorough, let's also compare their most recent Book values, which is equivalent to the total stockholder equity. Carvana's most recent book value is 2.1 billion, and Carmax's book value is 6.2 billion. Barchart's most recent Book value per share puts, Carvana at 8.3 per share, and Carmax at 41.89 per share.

But what SHOULD Carvana's value be? Well that depends on your valuation method. Let's go through them.

**""Carvana should be priced for growth""**

This is about as positive a take as you can get. This is assuming Carvana grows according to its own estimates, which is predicted by analysts and represents their view of the stock's growth. I am using a forward PE ratio for this calculation, which is equal to the current stock price divided by the estimated earnings for the future. Note that this is a 12 month calculation so the PE values will be slightly different than a ten trailing month PE.

|Earnings Per Share Projections|EPS|(Forward) PE|(Future) Stock Price With 25.90 PE|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|EPS Real 2024|$1.59|242|$41.18|
|EPS Estimate 2025|$5.06|76|$131.05|
|EPS Estimate 2026|$6.23|61.79|$161.36|
|Nvidia Estimate 2025|$4.02|43.96|$104.12|

So as you can see, in this reality, Carvana is a much better growth stock than Nvidia, which is widely considered the most valuable stock in the world. Just kidding, of course. Even assuming this level of growth, Carvana has an extremely high premium attached to it.

The final column estimates what the valuation would be if Carvana was given the average PE of stocks in the S&amp;P 500 right now (which is about 5.9 above historical averages, so pretty generous I think). As you can see, any stock price above $131 is pretty clearly pricing in returns from 2026, and even that suggests a **66% downside** from it's current level at $385.

**""Carvana should be equal to Carmax's Price to Earnings""**

What if Carvana was valued based on its earnings per share at the same level that carmax is (16.38), based on the ten trailing months for both?

|Price To Earnings|EPS (ttm)|16.38 PE|Stock Price|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Carvana|2.85|(2.85 \* 16.83)|$46.68|
|Carmax|3.68|(3.68 \* 16.83)|$60.27|

So in this reality, Carvana is a stock trading BELOW Carmax at $50 a share, representing an **82% downside**.

**""Carvana should be equal to Carmax's Price to Book Value""**

What if Carvana was valued based on the same Price to book value that carmax is? The book value is used sometimes when evaluating a company based on its raw value. Car companies and banks sometimes trade for a value pretty close to their book value, as they are not often priced for growth.

|Price To Book Value|Book Value Per Share|1.44 Price To Book Value|Stock Price|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Carvana|$8.30|(8.3 \* 1.44)|$11.95|
|Carmax|$41.89|(41.89 \* 1.44)|$60.32|

In THIS reality, Carvana would ALSO be trading below Carmax at $12 a share, representing a **97% downside**. And on top of that, we have to consider that both of these businesses are considering their cars to be assets, when those cars may or may not actually be worth as much as reported. So to be REALLY negative, you could say 97% downside is charitable.

**Carvana should be equal to its price target**

In this reality, you never read this post and dont care about anything except what REAL stock analysts say. Okay. Well, fine. The street high price target is $450 per share, representing a **16.9% upside** over the next 12 months. The average is $352.17, representing an **8.5% downside**, and the lowest is $260 representing a **32.5% downside**. So all but the most bullish of analysts also agree that Carvana is actually ABOVE what its price should be in 12 months.

**Summary**

If you ask me, Carvana is overvalued. Possibly by an order of magnitude. Buy puts on it if you're a sicko like I am and want companies to be valued reasonably. A valuation sicko. And then I guess tell people about it, because unless people actually BELIEVE it's overvalued, it's going to stay overvalued until the truth comes out.

My advice to current shareholders is to take your profit and put it into a healthy business. Or if you aren't invested, consider long dated puts! If word is able to get out about this, maybe consider shorter dated puts, who knows?

**TL;DR**

Carvana scam stock, buy puts.

398,NVDA,Absolutely everything you need to know about AMZN earnings today,"Okay guys, so Amazon is set to release its Q2 earnings after the market closes today with an analyst call at 5 pm. This is gonna be a big one. Did anyone catch META yesterday? Fuck. 

For Amazon, analysts expect revenue around $162 billion (up 10%) and EPS between $1.32 and $1.33, with operating income projected at $16.7 to $16.87 billion. And during this sesh, the key areas to watch will include AWS growth (estimated at $30.77 billion, up 17%), AI investments (over $100 billion capex planned), and advertising revenue (up 17% to $14.99 billion). Considering the stock performance, it's up 5% year-to-date, with bullish analyst sentiments (e.g., UBS raised price target to $271), but some valuation concerns exist (GF Value at $189.47). External factors like tariffs and Prime Day success could influence outcomes, with potential for significant stock movement based on guidance. I know that people are going to be playing AMZN earnings so I wanted to do a little write up for /r/Stocks so you guys are well informed. And I'll even post what I plan on getting at the end. 

**Analyst Expectations and Financial Projections**

Analysts have provided a range of estimates for Amazon's Q2 performance, showing a lot of optimism. 

Revenue: Expected to be around $162 billion, with variations such as $162.1 billion and $162.19 billion, representing a 9.5% to 10% year-over-year increase.  

Earnings Per Share (EPS): Forecasted at $1.32 to $1.33, up from $1.26 last year, with Amazon having beaten EPS estimates for nine consecutive quarters.  

Operating Income: Projected between $16.7 billion and $16.87 billion, a 13.8% to 15% increase, with an operating margin expected at 10.6% (up from 9.9% last year).  

These projections suggest strong growth, and I honestly think Amazon can exceed these figures and provide robust forward guidance. Especially given its historical ""beat and raise"" pattern, which may not suffice in the current up cycle.

**Key Business Segments and Growth Drivers**

Amazon's diverse operations are expected to drive its Q2 results, with several segments highlighted as critical:  

1) AWS (Amazon Web Services)  

AWS remains a cornerstone of Amazon's profitability, with Q1 2025 revenue up 17% to $29.3 billion. For Q2, net sales are estimated at $30.77 billion, with growth of 17% excluding foreign exchange effects. However, operating margins are expected to drop to 35% due to significant investments in AI and infrastructure, part of a $100+ billion capex plan for 2025. This segment contributed 17% of revenue and 58% of operating income last year, making it a focal point for me.

2) Advertising Revenue  

Advertising is another growth engine, with Q1 2025 revenue up 18%. For Q2, it's projected to rise 17% to $14.99 billion, reflecting increased monetization of Amazon's platform as more businesses leverage its advertising ecosystem.

3) Prime Membership  

Prime membership grew 9% year-over-year to 220 million globally, providing a stable revenue stream through subscription fees. This growth, driven by benefits like free shipping and streaming, is expected to continue supporting Amazon's financials.

4) Operational Efficiency  

Amazon has improved operational efficiency, reducing fulfillment costs and increasing delivery speeds, which should enhance margins. These efforts are part of a broader strategy to balance growth investments with profitability.

5) Investments in AI and Other Areas  

Amazon's commitment to AI is a major theme, with a $100+ billion capital expenditure plan for 2025, primarily focused on AWS and AI services. This includes developing proprietary chips like Trainium2 and partnering with Nvidia to enhance AI capabilities. While these investments may pressure short-term margins, they position Amazon for long-term growth in the expanding AI market. Additionally, Project Kuiper, a satellite initiative, is noted as an area of rising expense, alongside e-commerce and content/advertising investments.

**Analyst sentiments are generally bullish**

UBS raised its price target from $249 to $271, calling Amazon the ""most coiled"" Big Tech name, implying an 18% upside and highlighting extensive investments across e-commerce, AWS, content/advertising, and Kuiper. Other analysts, including Wedbush, William Blair, and Stifel, reiterated ""outperform"" or ""buy"" ratings, with an average price target of $252.66 (range: $195 to $305). 

**External Factors and Market Context**

Several external factors could influence Amazon's earnings and stock reaction:  

Consider the Tariffs. Earlier this year, tariff concerns, particularly on Chinese goods, weighed on the stock, but recovery followed eased U.S. tariffs. Analysts are parsing impacts on e-commerce, with Amazon benefiting from stockpiling ahead of potential tariff hikes.

Also, think about the Prime Day Success. Held in July, Prime Day's performance could lift revenue guidance for the September-ending quarter, providing a positive signal for us.  

And finally, with any earnings post, we need to consider macroeconomic events such as inflation, interest rates, and consumer spending trends could affect retail sales, particularly in online stores and third-party seller revenue, expected to grow 6.5% to $58.99 billion and 7% to $38.74 billion, respectively.

**Potential Catalysts**

I'm expecting accelerating AWS growth, better-than-expected margins, new AI announcements, and strong Q3 guidance. UBS expects upward revisions to operating profit and free-cash-flow as revenue grows, potentially more dramatic than peers.  


**Comparisons**

Microsoft's recent Q2 results, where cloud growth was a significant driver, boosts my confidence in Amazon's cloud business, with MSFT stock jumping 4.47% in after-hours trading. This really does show how important AWS performance will be, as Amazon faces a high bar following Microsoft's strong showing.

**So what to do?**

Amazon's Q2 earnings are poised to be a major event, with strong growth expected across key segments like AWS, advertising, and Prime, supported by significant AI investments. This will be a great opportunity to get a call spread. For those who don't know anything about option trading, you don't need to continue reading. But for those who do, I'll be buying the 8/1 245c (@ 2.67) and selling the 252.5c (@ 1.11). This means I can get the spread for $156, with a potential max gain of 4.8x if AMZN can go up about 7.8% with earnings. Considering the stock moves on average about ±8% with earnings, there's a good chance it'll go up 4-8% today. 

Next week tho, we have a ton more earnings so I think I'll be doing a post on PLTR and AMD.",122,41,1753978189.0,2025-07-31T16:09:49+00:00,t3_1me5q6m,stocks

399,NVDA,Nvidia’s first-mover advantage is real but AMD is now ready to capture a significant share of the AI GPU market,"I think that AMD's release of the MI350 series of GPUs will give them a significant presence in the market for the following main reasons. First of all, the performance metrics I mentioned earlier put it on par with Nvidia in terms of hardware. Considering Nvidia's staggering GPU margins, AMD could offer a similar product at a much lower price to grab market share. In fact, there are reports that AMD has plans to raise prices, which one would guess indicates strong demand for its MI350 series.



While data center expansions may not have been worth it for developers in the past, hundreds of billions of dollars are currently being poured into GPUs for AI. Saving even a fraction of that would incentivize companies and their developers to use AMD's open-source ROCm platform instead of CUDA. in short, the GPU market is much larger than it used to be due to the demand for AI, and that changes the economics. In the past, it may not have been worth a developer's time to add a new server stack, but when building entirely new data centers specifically for AI, it makes sense to figure these things out if you can save even 10%.



Additionally, the AI market needs GPU resources both for training to build models and for inference to apply those models to solve problems in real-world scenarios. In the early days of the AI boom, training required more resources, or at least about half of each. In the future, reasoning resources are expected to grow faster than training resources. Fortunately (or more likely by design), products such as AMD's MI350 excel at inference and are on par with the Blackwell family. Here's how much AMD expects AI usage to continue to grow, with breakthroughs in training and inference",44,17,1753969412.0,2025-07-31T13:43:32+00:00,t3_1me1y8x,stocks

128,NVDA,Is a META stock split in the cards?,"META, Nvidia, Broadcom, Chipotle and Super Micro all did high-profile stock splits last year. But Meta, with its shares hovering just above $700, has continued to hold out.

 The company remains a candidate for a split, given the high stock price and heavy investor interest in the name. While Nvidia did a 10-for-1 split last year with shares trading above $1,000, Apple's 4-for-1 split in 2020 came with the stock in the $500 vicinity.

 Companies often say they conduct stock splits to make prices more accessible to investors, though fractional trading has become commonplace now, so investors don't necessarily need to shell out $700 to own a piece of Meta. Some experts say the benefits of stock splits are more psychological, since investors who do want to invest $700 in a company might feel better getting multiple shares out of that

400,NVDA,"Microsoft tops $4 trillion in market cap after hours, joining Nvidia in exclusive club","The $4 trillion club has a second member, at least based on after-hours trading.

Following a better-than-expected earnings report on Wednesday, Microsoft shares jumped 8%, lifting the software giant’s market cap to about $4.1 trillion. Should the rally stick on Thursday, Microsoft would join chipmaker Nvidia, which hit $4 trillion for the first time earlier this month.

Microsoft reported 18% revenue growth, its fastest rate of expansion in over three years, driven by its Azure cloud computing business. Microsoft disclosed Azure revenue in dollars for the first time, and said sales from Azure and other cloud services exceeded $75 billion in fiscal 2025, up 34% from the prior year.

As of the close on Wednesday, Microsoft shares were up 22% for the year, topping the S&amp;P 500′s 8% gain. Microsoft hit a record close of $513.71 on July 25. The stock is above $553 in extended trading.

Nvidia and Microsoft, two of the biggest beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence boom, have zoomed past Apple on the market cap leaderboard. Apple is third at about $3.2 trillion, with its stock having fallen 17% this year as investors worry that the iPhone maker is getting left behind in AI. Apple reports quarterly results after the bell on Thursday.

Among tech’s megacaps, Nvidia has been the best performer in 2025, up 33%. The chipmaker’s graphics processing units (GPUs) are the backbone of the large language models being developed by Microsoft, OpenAI, Google, Meta and others, and they’re filling up data centers being built by those same companies.

Nvidia is scheduled to report results in late August.

📉 **Signal 1: Stocks vs. Bonds — Expected Returns Near Convergence**  
The first chart compares expected returns of the S&amp;P 500 and 10-year U.S. Treasuries. The spread is now near zero—meaning equities and bonds are offering similar prospective returns. This often signals an overheated equity market and may trigger capital rotation back into bonds.

  
📊 **Signal 2: Overextended Breadth**  
The second chart shows the percentage of S&amp;P 500 stocks trading above their 50-day moving average. Once again, it has surpassed the 75% threshold—levels that have marked local peaks at least twice in the past year.

104,NVDA,Is Oklo/SMR/TerraPower the next NVDA/AMD/Intel?,"
Ok so here’s how I’m seeing it.
Everyone’s focused on $NVDA, $AMD, $INTC, but they’re just one piece of the whole puzzle. Here’s how I see it: AI needs constant computational and electrical power. Not just for the data centers and the fabs that make the chips, but the chips themselves burn power 24/7. The more models scale, the more energy they eat. That power has to come from somewhere. Big tech ceos are already talking about potential future power shortages if we dont come up with something better than what we have rn
So here’s how I’m thinking about it:
We started with AI companies throwing money at chip companies →chip companies throwing money at fabs like TSMC →fabs and AI centers pulling insane amounts of power off the grid →and now we’re about to see power companies (especially nuclear) get flooded with cash →and that means the uranium miners feeding those reactors are next in line.
This is how i see the chain:
AI companies → NVDA / AMD / INTC → TSMC / Samsung → SMRs like Oklo / SMR / TerraPower → uranium miners like UUUU / NXE / CCJ.
Every stage up the chain got paid. The last ones left to run are nuclear and uranium.
I think we’re about to see a repeat of the same pattern within the next few years as we experience energy shortage. Just like how NVDA and AMD dominated chips, I think a couple players will dominate nuclear. Right now we’ve got:
* Oklo (backed by Sam Altman, just IPO’d $10.5B)
* NuScale / SMR (~$6.8B)
* TerraPower (still private but Gates-backed and getting a ton of attention)
That’s probably the big 3. Others will show up, but like everything else, a couple names are going to take 80% of the market and leave everyone else behind.
Same goes for uranium. CCJ is the king, but NXE and UUUU are getting attention. Supply is tight, and if nuclear demand explodes, miners get squeezed upward just like GPU demand squeezed NVDA.
So yeah, are Oklo / SMR / TerraPower are the next NVDA / AMD / INTC  just further up the chain? The ones getting paid by the ones getting paid.
I’m looking at LEAP calls and they are not that expensive while they’re still under the radar. It’s the last piece of the AI/infrastructure puzzle that hasn’t run yet.
What do you guys think? Am I early? I just dropped a few grand on $UUUU and OKLO july 2026 calls so Im seaking guidance from fellow degenerates. Also I know were still years ahead of nuclear, but I have a big FOMO…",4,59,1753832499.0,2025-07-29T23:41:39+00:00,t3_1mcranr,stocks
402,NVDA,Meta Capex and Opex will shake Wallstreet to the core.,"(post translate and enhanced with AI) 

The AI fever continues driving the market to record highs.

After blowing through $60 billion on the Metaverse, Zuckerberg is now racing to lead the charge for super intelligence and infinite gains.

While I'm somewhat skeptical about this strategy of hiring a bunch of rockstar researchers who have never worked together and expecting them to perform miracles, we all have to admire Zuck's boldness.

But my point here is about whether Wall Street truly understands the magnitude of spending that Meta is committing to, and how this will affect financial results in the coming months and years.

I can't think of any similar example other than Meta itself between 2019 and 2022 with the Metaverse. And even this seems to be an order of magnitude larger.

Perhaps a similar positive example would be Microsoft's pivot to the Cloud in 2012. But in that situation, there was only one major competitor (AWS).

To wrap up: I expect that tomorrow we'll see much stronger movements in companies like Nvidia, AMD, Dell, IBM on the upside and Google and Oracle on the downside.

138,NVDA,Donald Trump freezes export controls to secure trade deal with China,"&gt;“This move represents a strategic mis-step that endangers the United States’ economic and military edge in artificial intelligence,” they write in the letter, which was seen by the Financial Times. The letter was also signed by David Feith, the former top National Security Council technology official in the current Trump administration, and Liza Tobin, who served in the NSC during Trump’s first term. Kyle Bass, a Trump supporter and founder of Hayman Capital Management, also signed. The experts said the H20 was a “potent accelerator of China’s frontier AI capabilities” that was more powerful than the H100, an advanced Nvidia chip blocked for export to China, in one key respect. They said it outperformed the H100 in “inference” — the execution of AI functions as opposed to the training of AI models — and would help produce autonomous weapons systems, intelligence surveillance platforms, and other military advancements. “We are fuelling the very infrastructure that will be used to modernise and expand the Chinese military,” they said in the letter, arranged by an advocacy group called Americans for Responsible Innovation. James Mulvenon, an expert on China’s military and chief intelligence officer at Pamir Consulting, said the problem was not limited to one chip or company. “These decisions will determine which political system, which values, will ultimately control the most powerful technology in the history of the world.”

405,NVDA,Aurora Innovations (AUR) - Current front runner in autonomous trucking software and hardware,"


https://aurora.tech/

Looking into AUR next. Autonomous trucking hardware/software company. Summary:

    •    Cash on hand: $1.15–1.2B

    •    Burn rate: $142M/Q or $600–700M/annually

    •    Runway: ~6–7 quarters (18–22 months), assuming no change

    •    To extend this runway, Aurora must either reduce burn, raise new funds, or both before cash reserves are exhausted.


Aurora Innovation has established strategic partnerships with several leading companies to advance the development and deployment of its self-driving technology, particularly for autonomous trucks. Key partnerships include those with Nvidia and Continental, focusing on both the software and hardware aspects of autonomous driving systems. Other significant collaborations involve companies like Uber Freight, FedEx, Hirschbach Motor Lines, PACCAR, Ryder, Schneider, and Volvo, reflecting a broad ecosystem approach to commercializing autonomous trucking. 


Aurora Innovation (AUR) was co-founded by Chris Urmson, the former chief technology officer of Google/Alphabet Inc.'s self-driving team, which became known as Waymo, as well as by Sterling Anderson, former head of Tesla Autopilot, and Drew Bagnell, former head of Uber's autonomy and perception team.

They are already doing test runs between Houston and Dallas, and just started a run between El Paso and Phoenix (a 1000 mile, 14 hour run that currently cannot legally be done by a single human driver in a day due to a max of 11 hours driving time allowed). This is part of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's (FMCSA) Hours of Service (HOS) regulations. The 11 hours of driving must be taken within a 14-consecutive-hour period, after at least 10 consecutive hours off duty. 

This is a huge advantage of autonomous trucks, they can operate 24 hours a day with no breaks legally required. 

So they have a huge runway right now for cash on hand compared to cash burn, they seem to be one of the leaders compared to Waymo (Waymo stopped doing trucking and focused solely on cab company)

A couple other speculative competitors but the closest is a privately owned company so can’t invest in it anyway. My guess is there is no winner take all for self driving and most likely a competition based future until one rockets to the front of the pack by being head and shoulders above the others…Which could be 5-10 years from now, but plenty of money to be made between now and then. Google and AUR are the best bets. 

Multi year hold for real gains, could still easily see a 100% gain in the next 0.5-2 years. Potential 10x by 2030.  

Aur at $11b market cap today, Waymo is like $45b right now. 
Most analysts have it valued at $10 a share. 
 
No debt and $1b cash on hand is really nice. 

Holding 3000 shares and $4000 worth of Jan 2026 $10 calls and $10-$15 2027 leaps.

This company has some seriously solid capabilities,  theyre not just a semiconductor test equipment play anymore. Their robotics division is providing the robotic arms for what Amazon is calling their most advanced warehouse automation yet (apparently these robots have ""a sense of touch""). Plus they are working with Nvidia on path planning tech thats supposedly 50-80x faster than traditional approaches.

TER is down 21% YTD and 38% over the past 12 months despite being what analysts are calling a great play in AI/robotics. With all the hype around automation stocks, you think being Amazons robotics supplier would generate more sustained momentum.

About a dozen boutique firms now specialize in repairing Nvidia's H100 GPUs, chips that somehow made it into China despite the restrictions, according to two firms in Shenzhen, China's tech hub.

The co-owner of a company that has been working on fixing Nvidia's gaming GPUs for 15 years and started working on AI chips at the end of 2024 said, “The demand for repairs is really high.”

The report says that business has been so good that the owners have set up a new company to handle these orders, which can now repair up to 500 Nvidia AI chips per month.

If Nvidia manufacturing capacity is booked for the foreseeable future, we should see Amphenol continue to run. They also pay an ok dividend.

129,NVDA,Richtech Robotics ($RR) - Deep Dive: Undervalued AI Robotics Play,"I've been doing some research into **Richtech Robotics ($RR)**, an AI robotics company that seems to be flying under the radar. After digging into their financials, partnerships, and market position, I think it presents a compelling opportunity. Here's a breakdown of what I've found:

**Current Snapshot (as of July 23, 2025):**

* **Buy-in Price:** $2.04
* **Market Cap:** $237 million
* **Shares Outstanding:** 114.8 million
* **Short Interest:** 29% (Up from 27% yesterday, according to [Fintel](https://fintel.io/ss/us/rr)) (Significant short interest, which could fuel a squeeze if momentum continues)

**Analyst &amp; Valuation Targets:**

* **Target Price:** $3.20 (Implies a **Target Market Cap** of $239.58 million, though note the slight discrepancy with the current market cap given the target price vs. shares outstanding)
* **Simply Wall St. Valuation:** Listed as **47% undervalued**.

**Why I'm Bullish on Richtech Robotics:**

1. **Strategic Partnership with NVIDIA:**
   * Richtech has partnered with NVIDIA to incorporate **NVIDIA Connect** for its customers.

2. **Leading the Pack in AI Robotics Deployment:**
   * Richtech specializes in AI robots for **delivery, service and hospitality, and cleaning.**
   * Also note that their technologies are **already deployed in businesses across the country.** This gives them a significant head start compared to other companies (like Tesla's Optimus, for example) that are still in earlier stages of bringing their AI robots to market.
   * Their flagship **ADAM and Scorpion robot systems** are designed, engineered, and assembled in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA, indicating a commitment to domestic production.
3. **Strong Institutional &amp; Insider Confidence:**
   * **Vanguard, Blackrock, and UBS** have collectively bought millions of shares over the past two quarters, particularly in Q1 2025.
   * **Insiders** also showed strong conviction, purchasing over 6 million shares in Q1 2025. This strong insider buying is a very positive signal.
4. **Improving Financial Health (Despite Current Revenue Status):**
   * While the company is currently **net negative in revenue**, this hasn't hindered progress so far.
   * Impressively, their **debt-to-asset percentage has dropped dramatically** from nearly 33% in Q4 2024 to **under 3% last quarter**. This shows a strong improvement in financial management and stability.
5. **Momentum and Technical Indicators:**
   * **Webull notes 11 bullish indicators** for the short term.
   * Signals include **bullish momentum on the weekly chart** and the **chart crossing above the 200-day Moving Average (MA)** – often considered a strong bullish sign.
   * According to Webull, it exhibits **strong quantitative momentum.**
6. **Expansion and Growth Potential:**
   * Richtech recently acquired a **new 20,000 square foot property in Las Vegas**, which is expected to **expand their manufacturing and assembly capacity by 400%**. This suggests significant planned growth and increased production capabilities.
7. **Russell 2000 Inclusion:**
   * The company's inclusion in the **Russell 2000 and 3000 indices** provides increased visibility and liquidity, as it's tracked by numerous passive funds.

**Potential Risks/Things to Watch:**

410,NVDA,"AMD positions itself in the inference segment, expecting the total addressable market (TAM) for inference to be larger than that of training","ZF Su has done a remarkable job at AMD, taking it from a struggling company to a company that now has a market capitalization that surpasses Intel's and is well ahead of NVIDIA's. This is not the first time that AMD has been at a disadvantage. This isn't the first time AMD has been at a disadvantage, and it's highly unlikely that AMD will overtake NVIDIA in market capitalization in the next few years, but the gap is certainly closing. Over the past year, AMD has been dubbed a “senior money destroyer” by investors as Wall Street analysts' price targets have fallen along with AMD's stock price, but that's now reversing. Market optimism, AMD's win over NVIDIA in AI inference, its partnership with the Middle East, and OpenAI's favoring of AMD GPUs have led to a rebound in the stock and Wall Street has raised its price target. Global investment in AI infrastructure is only going to increase, with McKinsey estimating that by 2030 the figure will be as high as $7 trillion. AI reasoning is essential during this tech boom. If AMD introduces a better product for this specific element in its GPUs, AMD will significantly close the gap as customers will want AMD GPUs for inference rather than training.

AMD is positioning itself for the future in the inference space rather than competing with NVIDIA in the training space now. The improvements they proposed in their recent AI keynote, as well as OpenAI's adoption of the MI400X, are very optimistic for AMD as growth soars with the lifting of restrictions in China.",35,12,1753451889.0,2025-07-25T13:58:09+00:00,t3_1m8zvus,stocks

Their chips are in, China will continue to find ways to smuggle them in which means some entity will be buying them as a front and reselling to China.  

Translation: there is a ongoing demand for the latest high end Nvidia chips from China that The company is fulfilling (unknowingly) and that will contrive to translate into earnings and push the stock higher.

130,NVDA,NVIDIA Was Cooked in the $DENN — Now It’s Our Turn to Eat,"  
Opendoor ripped. KSS followed. DNUT is baking. The cycle's not over — it’s just changing booths.  
These aren't random pumps. It's a pattern.  
Each move is a reawakening of a beaten-down industry:

https://preview.redd.it/q5s9qqxvbuef1.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea6b4bb43ca6cb5819767d651cab2bb162438df6

* Housing (Opendoor): Left for dead post-ZIRP, suddenly repriced on AI + interest rate pivot.
* Retail ($KSS): Legacy department stores with real estate value finally getting attention.
* QSR/Fast Food ($DNUT): Forgotten brands rediscovered as margin machines.

And now: Casual dining.  
$DENN is the last place the market hasn’t looked. It’s trading like a zombie, but it’s alive, profitable, and meme-worthy.  
When forgotten sectors come back to life, they don’t walk, they run. Denny’s is next.

Meet $DENN:  
Current price: $4.21Average analyst target: $7.46 (+78% upside)  
P/E: 8.5×  
EV/EBITDA: \~8×  
Short interest: 7.5% of float, 4.2 days to cover  
Options flow: Put/Call ratio at 0.39 — call buyers stacking up

https://preview.redd.it/7169xtsxbuef1.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67caf7e06d302540166a06067de9e6497c8e2508

This isn’t just a meme — it’s a cash-flowing diner with a cult brand, low float, and an AI legend baked in.  
Let's eat.  


1. The Setup: Low Float + Short Sellers = Full Send  
Everyone's high on donuts and department stores. Meanwhile, $DENN is serving profit at liquidation prices.

* Revenue: Up YoY
* EPS: Positive
* EBITDA: Positive
* Insider/institutional ownership: \~85%
* Share price: Down 47% YoY

Denny’s is trading like it’s going bankrupt. It’s not. It’s profitable. And the market cap is so small, one news cycle or a volume spike could light the fuse.

2. The Valuation Gap Is Dumb

|Company|P/E|EV/EBITDA|EV/Sales|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|$DENN|8.5×|7.9×|1.4×|
|McDonald’s|25×|\~16×|8.3×|
|Starbucks|33×|\~18×|2.9×|
|Restaurant Brands|21×|\~15×|5×|

You’re telling me this brand — with 1,600+ locations and positive free cash flow — is worth 8× earnings while MCD is at 25×?  
If Denny’s even drifts toward 12×, we’re looking at $7–9.

3. Why Bulls Have Ammo

* Short interest is real — 7.5% of float short, 4.2 days to cover.
* Options are dirt cheap — sub-$5 stock means cheap OTM calls.
* Call flow &gt; Put flow — Put/Call ratio is under 0.4.
* Tight float — Institutions + insiders own \~85%.
* Hype hook — NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang literally started as a dishwasher at a Denny’s.
* Recession play — In downturns, people trade down to diners. Denny’s wins on value.

This is the kind of thing memes are made of. Nostalgia, underpricing, and just enough short interest.

4. Bear Cases (Weak)

* “Same-store sales down” → True, but offset by franchising and promos.
* “Debt high” → Net debt/EBITDA \~3.9×, not ideal but manageable.
* “GLP-1 will kill fast food” → MCD, SBUX, CMG say otherwise. People still eat pancakes at 2am.

You’re not paying for growth here. You’re paying for survivability and a re-rating — both of which are live.

5. Scenarios

|Case|Multiple|Target|Return|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Nothing changes|10× EPS|$5.50|\+30%|
|Peer-discount re-rate|12×|$7–8|\+70–100%|
|Industry average|15×|$9–11|\+120–160%|
|Godcandle|Who cares|$12+|Moon|

Even the “meh” case gets you +30%. That’s rare in this tape.

6. Why This Is The Play

✓ Meme-able brand  
✓ Jensen Huang dishwasher lore  
✓ Sub-$5 = option-friendly  
✓ Institutional float strangle  
✓ Real business + cash flow  
✓ Under-owned, under-covered  
✓ Recession upside optionality

It checks every box. And right now, nobody’s looking. Yet.

7. Recent “Problems” That Are Actually Bullish

|Headline|Fear|Reality|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Dividend suspended|“No income!”|More cash for buybacks and promos|
|Flat traffic|“No growth!”|Targeting budget diners with new promos|
|Store closures|“Shrinking!”|Rationalizing footprint and lifting margins|

These aren’t red flags. They’re cleanup signals. Management is adjusting.

8. Someone’s Already Loading  
Options flow lit up last week — particularly on November $5 calls.  
Call buying outpaced puts nearly 3:1. Volume jumped.

This isn’t meme-chasers in weeklies. This looks like early positioning.  
You’ve seen how this script ends.

9. The Play  
Shares: I’m building a core under $4.50.  
Calls: Nov 21 $5C — currently \~35¢.  
Risk/reward: If it hits $8, those calls go 7–10×. If it hits $12, max pain.

This is one of the cleanest small-cap asymmetry setups I’ve seen since early 2021.

10. Jensen Washed Plates. I’m Serving Profits.  
Before GPUs, before Blackwell, before trillion-dollar caps — there was a kid in a Denny’s kitchen.  
Jensen Huang’s origin story didn’t start in a Stanford lab.  
It started behind the counter, flipping eggs and busing tables.

Now, the same diner that built an AI godfather is trading like it’s dying.  
That’s the mismatch. That’s the trade.

My position: Long shares. Long calls.

131,NVDA,RXRX is undervalued IMO and overly shorted (last post I'll make about this),"Recursion pharmaceuticals is a bio-tech company that uses an AI platform with wet and dry labs to identify compounds that are the most likely candidate to succeed in making it through clinical trials that went public in 2021.

Before anyone rips into me, yes I know they are unprofitable. Maybe I have a gambling problem or maybe I am just truly regarded.

The company has roughly 500 million in cash on hand which gives them a runway to Q4 2027, with 4 major collaborative research agreements that includes milestone payments for research as well as developmental/regulatory milestone payments. Then to cap it all off any drug candidate that is brought to market Recursion will receive a royalty for somewhere in the high single digit to mid teens. The best part of this is that Recursion is not responsible for late- stage development and commercialization costs.

Below is a brief summary from the annual report to shareholders:

https://preview.redd.it/b8o76vc84oef1.png?width=906&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d3da32aa593fae3f0b5d9346c51af1cf3f621fd

Current collaborative partnerships and incentives

After seeing the potential earnings over the next few years I started to wonder why the stock price has been stagnant. Especially since there has not been any negative news or disappointing clinical trials recently.

So I dug into the share holders and found 70% institutional ownership:

https://preview.redd.it/xstrrxta4oef1.png?width=998&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66c20020a23b04940dfccfa452c1afb964e73b54

Say what you will about institutional ownership some love it and some hate it. But it does provide a certain stabilizing factor.

Also of note NVIDIA owns close to 2% of RXRX. It is one of 6 investments NVIDIA has in its portfolio.

Up next I viewed insider ownership activity:

https://preview.redd.it/rfxfd5wd4oef1.png?width=1007&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=203f8da10f94b282f8f829f3f679775191a237ec

Nothing really revealing from the insiders.

How about the options chain:

https://preview.redd.it/k6cnow1h4oef1.png?width=1305&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=49b4fa7114c1488d1354919d6ab991c5abffc6b4

0.38 ratio seems to show generally optimistic sentiment

So why is the stock where it is?

https://preview.redd.it/0xlyxdji4oef1.png?width=1007&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=302ac410ab7f36f59e0478e95de0c7229fe45356

There we go 30% short interest, that is wild since there is 70% institutional ownership.

134,NVDA,BZAI is growing rapidly,"The last time **BZAI** gapped was last Thursday when **BlaizeAI** just received a contract for $120M from Starshine Computing Power Technology, summing its **total contracts to $176M for 2025/26**. Today (7/21/25) we had an increase in the analyst ratings to 6$ (https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/blaize-nasdaqbzai-rating-increased-to-buy-at-rosenblatt-securities-2025-07-21/), nowhere close to the P/E ratio of many AI companies (Real **EoY price target is $10-$16**). The true valuation is close to $50B+ with a TAM of over $240B+.

This is not a pump/dump company like OPEN, CLBR/PEW, BMNR or BBBY... It's a legit company. Surprisingly there is still little buzz on reddit about BZAI. **BZAI is an AI long play that already has a product**.

Firstly, **BZAI is a US based company, with US manufacturing at Texas**. Secondly, BZAI has **contracts/MoUs with SCPT, Gulf Ministry of Defense, CBIST Korea, and Turbo Federal**. You can read about it on the BZAI subreddits. This post will discuss only the reasoning about its current status, and future potential.

I assume people are unaware about the real heavy lifting hardware has to perform in order to realize actual AI products. Sure, NVIDIA designs GPU architectures that supports CUDA, but those chips are useless if you want to see AI at your doorstep. **You need an edge AI processor to churn the fast on-the-spot data and send only important features back to the central mainframe AI servers.**

Let's take an example, when you yell at Siri/Alexa/Cortana/Gemini to give you recommendations for food, your phone first translates your voice to bits, the bits are then aggregated into blocks of features. These features are then send to the central Meta/Apple/Amazon/Google servers to say ""look this person is hungry, what do we give them to eat?"", The NVIDIA GPUs in the mainframe servers crunch these features based on past/present/future personal likes and the business models they are trying to capitalize, and attempt to convince you to eat at perhaps Chipotle. The former, your phone is an ""edge processor"" the latter is a ""recommender system"".

This is exactly what Big 5 are trying to integrate, an ""AI"" processor onto the phone, because its not efficient/necessary to perform useless requests like your food recommendation on the actual mainframe servers that probably are cracking quantum entanglement. Chips like Google Tensor/Apple Neural Engine/Samsung Exynos 990 exist in the latest phones, which perform the trivial AI tasks. **This is where BZAI comes into play.** A phone is a piece of hardware that's broadly non-essential. **Essential AI products that need edge compute hardware** factor in size, space, data rates, energy dissipation and critical paths, interconnect speeds, cache coherency, and BRAM to name some and above all the software to integrate with the hardware. A full hardware-software stack! **BZAI provides this full stack in their packaged hardware-software solutions:**

Some more key points from Q1 are:

* Turbo Federal (Defense): Blaize's collaboration with Turbo Federal has progressed rapidly from strategic engagement to execution. The partnership is now entering the commercialization phase, with purchase orders in motion to deploy Blaize-powered servers and AI Studio orchestration software for perimeter security and real-time inference across defense environments.
* Ministry of Defense (Gulf Region): Blaize continues to deepen its engagement with a national Ministry of Defense, progressing through proof-of-concept and field qualification stages. These engagements are focused on delivering trusted AI inference capabilities for situational awareness and mission-critical decision-making.
* Smart Security Showcase (U.S. Market): At North America's largest physical security and smart infrastructure technology event, Blaize demonstrated real-time, deployable AI applications for perimeter defense, school safety, and smart surveillance. Integrated with partners such as OrionVM, Thrive Logic, and CVEDIA, Blaize's live demonstrations attracted significant interest from commercial and federal decision-makers seeking scalable edge intelligence solutions.
* CBIST (South Korea): Blaize was selected by the Chungbuk Institute of Science and Technology (CBIST) to lead the Chungbuk Digital Innovation Hub, delivering edge AI infrastructure to support regional smart city deployment across South Korea's Chungcheongbuk-do province.

With their first contract underway it's only a few weeks/months of time before they roll in their other signed contracts, of course its speculatively, but no drama and all the fun. Very positive and bullish sign.

Again the total addressing market is huge:

* Smart cities and traffic control - Real-time traffic analysis, pedestrian detection, and anomaly detection
* Retail &amp; Industrial Automation - Shelf inventory analysis, foot traffic counting, and shopper behavior analytics.
* Smart Surveillance &amp; Access Control - Real-time face detection, license plate recognition, threat detection.
* Healthcare Edge Applications - Remote diagnostics and point-of-care imaging analysis.
* Defense and Aerospace Situational awareness - ISR (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance), drone video processing.

All that said, if you look at the charts. The options charts (still low volume) clearly shows that MMs are hedging bets at 5$, a price point that might be unavailable in the long term.

413,NVDA,"Redditors working in IT, how do you feel about Cisco?","Some analysts are saying Cisco might be a great buy given it is undervalued compared to other AI infrastructure plays. But is it an AI play or just another cautionary tale? Some questions:

* How exciting is the partnership with Nvidia? Nvidia has their own networking products so how will this work? Will Nvidia end up just using Cisco's connections to get in front of Enterprise customers and then just bypass Cisco a few years from now after Nvidia lays the foundations?

* Cisco is bragging that they've hit their $1 billion revenue with hyperscaler goal a quarter early. Is this sustainable? How excited should a Cisco investor be about this? 

* During a joint interview, Jensen said Nvidia and Cisco will work to ""rerack"" all the Enterprise networks because the new agentic AI is going to need different equipment. They estimated this is a 2-4 trillion market opportunity. Do you believe this? Has this already been priced into Cisco?

* Cisco ""wants to unify Management, Identity, Security, IoT, and Monitoring with Networking and they are farther along than any other company"" (credit u/idleline). Do you agree with this statement? Is this a clear competitive advantage not yet priced into the stock?

199,NVDA,Muted Results but Booming Guidance: NVDA Q2 Earnings Analysis,"**TL;DR at the bottom--I broke my wrist touching grass last weekend so this** ***is*** **the short version**

This is my third consecutive quarter posting an independent analysis of NVDA’s quarterly earnings. My Q4 FY25 and Q1 FY26 estimates are available on my profile, and a comparison to analyst consensus and actual results in those quarters can be seen below.

[Note 2025Q1 Refers to Non-GAAP H20 Excluded](https://preview.redd.it/mmfycac78bef1.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f6bdebbe39904b4b4e944ef04c1020325685bdf)

[While Analysts Consistently Underestimate Revenue, My Bullish Bias has Decreased Significantly](https://preview.redd.it/zvdf6kug8bef1.png?width=848&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf6b37820b364715f26fbff6c646388c7c67959d)

On last quarter's earnings call, the Company guided for a considerable slowdown in revenue growth. They noted that the forecast included a negative impact of $8 billion from losing access to China. Jensen was particularly open on the call, saying,

“On export control... the platform that wins China is positioned to lead globally. Today, however, the $50 billion China market is effectively closed to U.S. industry.”

Jensen has been consistently meeting with Trump and his administration to get back into China. As recently as July 14th, NVDA provided a positive update on this disruption in a blog post, telling investors they are going to regain the ability to do so soon. Unfortunately, this will likely not affect revenue in Q2, but could lead to optimism from The Company when issuing guidance for Q3 and beyond.

Like in Q1, I will analyze each of the four main revenue segments and create a combined estimate. Since the Data Center segment is both the largest and in the spotlight, I will start there. 

# Data Center Estimate:

When issuing guidance, Colette Kress (CFO) stated the following: “Total revenue is expected to be $45 billion, plus or minus 2%. We expect modest sequential growth across all of our platforms. In Data Center, we anticipate the continued ramp of Blackwell to be partially offset by a decline in China revenue.”  
  
The Blackwell ramp is expected to be completely recognized this quarter, yet the segment is set to only experience “modest growth” due to being locked out of China. The H20 sales halt hit with about three weeks left in Q1, and revenue grew 9.83% QoQ. NVDA still does not have the license required to sell in China, with less than two weeks left in Q2. A re-acceleration of growth seems unlikely this quarter, and my initial estimate is closer to 5-7% growth (\~$41 to $42 billion). 

[The Graph Shows Revenue from Data Centers Since 2024Q1 and Highlights the Deceleration in 2025Q1.](https://preview.redd.it/7n0g32oz8bef1.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d31bb77ea496875aa86919a961199b793d099415)

The negative impact from the disruption in China will be the largest in Q2, which suggests a continued slowdown in QoQ growth. $41.5 billion would represent just over 6% growth, and with the current data and outlook, it will serve as the preliminary estimate.

# Gaming Estimate:

The rebound in gaming revenue in Q1 outpaced even the most bullish estimates. The record $3.8 billion in Q1 revenue represented a \~50% QoQ increase and was over 15% higher than the previous record. The report cites strength from the partnership with Nintendo (Switch 2) and the CFO noted, “Strong adoption by gamers, creatives, and AI enthusiasts.” The gaming beat helped NVDA’s headline revenue total in Q1, and The Company is optimistic strength will continue. However, given the cyclical nature of gaming and Q1 being such a positive surprise, it is difficult to project further QoQ growth to another record. $3.5 billion in Q2 would achieve 20% YoY growth in this segment and will serve as the preliminary estimate.

[Visualization of Strong Rebound in Gaming Revenue in 2025Q1](https://preview.redd.it/a001knqd9bef1.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73ce824ea06d28dd1f08ba742e551b97b7cd20ec)

# Prof. Visualization / Robotics &amp; Auto Estimate:

In the interest of time, and given that these two segments combined for barely over $1 billion in Q1, these two segments are being bundled into one breakdown. Prof. Visualization was mentioned by the CFO on the conference call and is expected to return to QoQ growth after being flat in Q1. Robotics &amp; Auto was down sequentially in Q1 but still up over 70% YoY. There was no mention of expectations in Q2. I currently have \~$1.15 billion for the two segments combined, and will look to fine-tune this closer to the release date.

# Total Revenue Estimate: $46.15 Billion



# Earnings Estimate:

On the Q1 report, NVDA added a Non-GAAP EPS line that specifically excluded the H20 charge. It came in at $0.96 per share, surpassing the consensus of $0.93 but falling $0.01 short of my $0.97 estimate. 

There was some initial confusion surrounding the three metrics as “regular” Non-GAAP EPS came in at $0.81, much higher than the Factset analyst consensus of $0.73. 

In Q2, NVDA will likely return to reporting the standard two EPS metrics, and yahoo finance lists the average estimate from 40 analysts at $1.00 per share. The earnings whisper number is a bit lower at $0.94, while the highest estimate from a single analyst is $1.09. 

While it is relatively easy to find consensus estimates for headline figures like EPS and Total Revenue, most analysts do not break out revenue by segment nor show how they convert top-line revenue to bottom-line profitability. This analysis shows the full process of forecasting revenue by segment and how it translates to the bottom-line in a form of unique transparency. 

The last section established the revenue estimate, but to get to EPS, estimates need to be made for gross margin, operating expenses, non-operating expenses, and total shares outstanding. 

NVDA’s company-issued guidance for both gross margin and operating expenses has been largely reliable in recent quarters. In Q2, the company expects gross margin of 72% and operating costs of $4 billion, which are used in this estimate. 

The company does not issue guidance for non-operating expenses nor shares outstanding, but accurate estimates can be obtained. 

[Stabilization of Cost Increases in 2024 with uptick in 2025Q1](https://preview.redd.it/ulf2s2nz9bef1.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38ed7a3d33b88cfaf4134645ffd638b043f67ca7)

The above graph shows historical data for non-operating expenses and QoQ growth for the segment. The growth rate has largely stabilized compared to previous years, even with an uptick in Q1. $4.0 billion would represent a decrease back to about 5% growth, while my current estimate of $4.1 billion represents an increase of just under 8%. 

Estimating shares outstanding can be tricky, as the company’s share repurchase program is inconsistent. NVDA still has about $25 billion authorized under the current plan for share repurchases, but that is down after aggressive buybacks in Q1. 

This analysis estimates about $9 billion in buybacks in Q2, reducing the shares outstanding from 24.61 to 24.55 billion (60m shares @ 150 = $9 B). The estimate is similar to the amount repurchased in Q4 and is lower than repurchases in Q1.   


[EPS Calculation Visualized, While Highlighting Opaqueness of Consensus](https://preview.redd.it/kglfaixaabef1.png?width=1924&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d95f34e8f6bf00b14d87a7d6d645d9e400bb658)

The calculation comes out to $1.02 EPS, which is slightly above the average analyst’s expectations. $46.15 billion in revenue is also only slightly above the consensus. 

This is the closest my estimates have been to the consensus, which has been surpassed each of the last 10 quarters. Given that I expect relatively muted results this quarter, guidance for the rest of the year will be in focus during the call. 

# Guidance:

After the positive update on China sales, investors are looking for strong guidance. While it’s not as straightforward as adding the lost $8 billion back into the forecast, analysts are expecting the worst to be in the past. Investors are looking for signs that the “start of the new wave” Jensen mentioned last quarter will materialize this year. 

The current expectation for Q3 revenue is \~$51.5 billion, an increase of 13% from Q2 expectations ($45.55). In Q1, revenue grew 10% QoQ to $44.06 billion. This means analysts expect just over 3% growth in the current quarter with notable re-acceleration in Q3. 

Analysts are looking for at least a piece of the Chinese market in Q3 with the $51.5 billion forecast. Q2 guidance would have been closer to $53 billion with full access to China, suggesting the Q3 forecast still projects some disruption in China near term. 

If NVDA signals a faster-than-expected ramp in sales to China, guidance expectations that already look strong could still be too low. However, any delays in the licensing process or misaligned inventory could dampen Q3’s forecast. 

# Valuation:

Regardless of belief in the company, NVDA is expensive right now. “Expensive” in this case means that it is trading at higher multiples than multi-year averages. 

Even using the H20 excluded EPS number from Q1, NVDA has earned $3.34 per share over the last four quarters. Trailing earnings are expected to increase to $3.66 after Q2’s report, while full year EPS is currently expected to come in at around $4.30. 

Based on a current price of \~$173, NVDA is currently trading at over 51x TTM earnings, and 40x forward earnings.

While NVDA has previously traded for 40x forward earnings, it has also traded for closer to 20x forward earnings as recently as this year. 

NVDA is also currently experiencing an elevated Price to Sales ratio (higher than 75% of history) of over 28x sales, and its Price to Book ratio of 50x is more expensive than 91% of NVDA’s history. 

Buying NVDA at $170 makes sense only if the company continues to deliver bullish surprises on top of already sky-high expectations. I am not selling shares ahead of the report, even with the price outpacing my targets. 

# Positions:

When I began posting NVDA analysis and creating my price targets, NVDA traded for about $140 per share. At the time, I felt the price was fair, and it wasn’t until the liberation day tariff sell-off to sub $90 that I began buying more aggressively. 

I currently own 200 shares with a cost basis around $125. While I expected NVDA to recover rather quickly, the near 100% rally from April lows leads me to believe hype and FOMO are driving the price higher rather than fundamental growth. While NVDA’s growth has been explosive, the current price leaves no room for negative catalysts. 

Based on my expectations for NVDA in the rest of 2025, I sold an ATM covered call expiring in December. I am willing to sell at $175 between now and the end of the year, so I decided to collect $3000 ($1500 x2) selling that call option. I now have $15 of downside protection through December or will sell my shares for a massive profit.

110,NVDA,AI Action Day This Wednesday,"I posted a couple days ago expressing my view that money can be made by being on top of trump's agenda, policy-related news, etc. I'm not saying its easy, but I think in several instances so far this year, the ""puzzle pieces"" have been out there, and if you put them together, you could have positioned ahead of the news. MP was one i mentioned in my previous post but there have been others.

To get to the point... There is an ""AI Action Day"" event happening on Wednesday. Hosted by All-In podcast people (David Sachs) and with various tech leaders in attendance as well as Trump of course.  Supposedly this will be an announcement of a larger strategy to promote US AI dominance. I would bet that there are opportunities here. Not clear if there is a home run, but I think a smart person could figure out a smart way to play this.

Unfortunately, I'm not a smart person, but maybe collectively as a group of not-smart people, we can figure out some plays here.

I can't link sources for some reason, keeps deleting my post, but you guys can google more information regarding the event if you want. TLDR It's being hosted

Technology leaders participating in the event include **Chris Power, CEO of Hadrian**; **Shyam Sankar, CTO of Palantir**; **Paul Buchheit, Partner at YCombinator; James Litinsky, CEO of MP Materials; Lisa Su, CEO of AMD.**

Additional speakers are still being confirmed.

I don't think the obvious choices are going to move much here. NVDA is already up significantly and i don't expect any announcements big enough to move a 4 trillion market cap... The easing of chip restrictions is also already priced in now. I expected this will be touched on at the event, but it's no longer news.

Spitballing but a few ideas:

I think energy will be a major focus of any strategy announcement. This is an area that is critically important for AI, and an area where the US is SIGNIFICANTLY lagging China. I'm not too sure how this could be played, but I'm considering EQT. I was looking at them last week due to the PA AI event. The stock didn't move much unfortunately, but all of nat gas seems to have struggled to close the week for whatever reason. By no means an expert here, but EQT has a major grift angle in that their CEO is closely tied to the republican party/trump.

Datacenter buildout: PWR, ACM, FLR - not really sure here. Chatgpt helped me on this one. Maybe APLD? Could be some type of policy/tax incentive to stimulate datacenter construction. not that its really needed at this point...

I'm really just spitballing and hoping to start some conversation here.",12,11,1753052974.0,2025-07-20T23:09:34+00:00,t3_1m52zbb,stocks

111,NVDA,Nvidia Will Continue Controlling The AI Board,"Nvidia is the 'queen' of the AI ecosystem, dominating hardware, software, and systems and controlling key segments from training to inference and networking.

Unmatched AI leadership, explosive revenue growth, and strategic partnerships with players like Astera Labs, Credo, and Super Micro Computer reinforce Nvidia's central role.

China market access and the Omniverse platform provide significant new growth drivers, supporting a strong 12-24 month growth outlook and a buy rating.

Despite high absolute valuation multiples, Nvidia's rapid growth and favorable PEG ratios make it attractive versus peers; the main risk is US-China geopolitical tension.

I believe these companies are well-positioned in the AI ecosystem, but I realise that one piece is missing: the queen. Just like in a game of chess, the queen is the most powerful and versatile piece on the board. It can move in any direction (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) and quickly cover a wide area. That is why I believe it is a perfect fit for NVIDIA (NVDA). I say this because it dominates both offensively and defensively. Just as the queen controls most of the board, NVDA controls the most valuable parts of the AI infrastructure, from training to inference, simulation, and networking. Secondly, it is versatile and critical because it spans hardware, software, and systems. This is cool because few participants can match its breadth and influence. Finally, it leverages strategic partnerships. I mean, just as the queen commands pawns, rooks, and bishops, NVDA integrates system builders (such as Super Micro Computer (SMCI)), connectivity providers (such as Credo Technology Group (CRDO) and Astera Labs (ALAB)), and government AI programmes to expand its control over the AI battlefield.

So why is the queen so special?

Well, several factors set Nvidia apart. First and foremost, it holds an unparalleled leadership position in the AI field, thanks to the combination of hardware, software, and ecosystem advantages. Its Blackwell GPU architecture makes it uniquely special. Combined with the Omniverse simulation platform, we are driving self-reinforcing AI, which is driving explosive growth. For example, in the first quarter of the 2026 fiscal year, NVDA achieved revenue of $44.1 billion, representing a year over year increase of 69%. Data centre revenue reached $39.1 billion, up 73%. Some of Nvidia's key customers such as Microsoft , Google  OpenAI, and Meta  deploy tens of thousands of Nvidia's latest GPUs each quarter. For example, according to SA Weebler Finance data, hyperscale data centre operators are running approximately 1,000 NVLink rack systems (about 72,000 GPUs) per week, with further increases expected. Ideally, this means Nvidia's data centre run rate in the AI computing sector has exceeded $170 billion annually.

Secondly, NVDA's stack is also expanding beyond GPUs. As I mentioned, its global industrial simulation platform is now being used to digitise entire factories and cities. In fact, the platform has evolved to support critical infrastructure. Original equipment manufacturers like BMW are running over 30 virtual factories on the platform to optimise production in advance. As each AI solution requires an increasing amount of synthetic training data, NVDA's end-to-end solutions form an unparalleled moat. Ideally, this platform means more users generating more simulation data, ultimately driving demand for more Nvidia computing resources. What I see is that NVDA is now at the centre of the AI value chain.

Finally, the U.S. has approved the resumption of exports of NVIDIA H20 AI GPUs to China. This means NVIDIA will be able to access China's potential market, which is significant. According to a Morgan Stanley report, China's AI market is expected to reach $1.4 trillion by 2030.

China has been systematically implementing a long-term strategy to build its domestic artificial intelligence capabilities. Its strong academic foundation, innovative methods, data, talent, and growing foreign investment are driving it toward becoming a leading artificial intelligence powerhouse...

‘...China is less concerned with building the most powerful AI capabilities and more focused on bringing AI to market. China embraces open-source AI, while the United States appears to be moving toward closed, tightly controlled AI systems...’

‘...The next 6 to 12 months will be a critical period for Chinese AI companies, as more and more deployments aimed at solving real-world problems begin to demonstrate productivity gains.’

Due to this milestone, NVDA's Jensen Huang estimates that NVDA's potential market size  in China will reach $50 billion. This means that China's spending on AI will increase, and Nvidia's growth prospects are expected to be stronger than ever before. I expect this growth outlook to be reflected in the upcoming quarterly earnings report to be released on 27 August 2025.

These factors combined will undoubtedly accelerate Nvidia's growth trajectory over the next 12 to 24 months. Therefore, I assign a ‘Buy’ rating to Nvidia Corporation.

Nvidia's AI Ecosystem

Having highlighted the case for NVDA, I would like to connect it to some AI components I have researched previously. Some of these AI companies have remarkable growth prospects and are expected to align their growth trajectories with NVDA. Additionally, the connections between NVDA and these AI companies will help us better understand NVDA's future direction.

First, Astera Labs  is a leading connectivity chip company that recently went public in 2024. ALAB's chips support scalable and low-latency GPU rack interconnects. For more information on Astera Labs and its chips, please refer to Article 1 and Article 2. Now, Nvidia has publicly announced its collaboration with Astera on NVLink Fusion. This collaboration expands NVDA's total addressable market (TAM).

There is also Credo Technology, which is known for its active cables  re-timers, and SerDes chips. According to SA Oakoff Investments, most hyperscale computing vendors now consider CRDO's AEC to be the de facto standard for in-rack links. This means that AEC cables are the infrastructure required for NVDA's 72-GPU Blackwell rack.

Third, Super Micro Computer  and Celestica  manufacture and sell GPU racks and systems using NVDA technology. Nvidia currently provides complete data centre racks containing tens of thousands of GPUs, which are delivered to system builders like SMCI and CLS. They then collaborate with NVDA to package and sell these racks to hyperscale customers such as Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon. For more information, please refer to this article from SMCI and this article from Celestica.

In summary, these partnerships demonstrate NVIDIA's connectivity within the AI ecosystem. This confirms that NVIDIA is indeed the queen of the AI chessboard.

For a company with a market capitalisation of 4.22 trillion dollars, it still has significant growth opportunities, particularly in the Chinese market, which means there is much to watch for with NVIDIA. Additionally, I note that NVIDIA has an A- growth rating, as shown in the figure below. The company's expected revenue growth rate is 60.71%, while the industry median is 7.28%. Furthermore, its 3-5 year compound annual growth rate  for expected long-term earnings per share  growth is 29.09%, compared to the industry median of 14.29%. This clearly indicates the expected growth levels for certain potential AI opportunities, such as the Omniverse platform and the Chinese AI market.

Now, when it comes to valuation, the growth outlook is becoming clearer. First, when I look at the chart below, I notice that most metrics are above the industry median, indicating that the valuation is higher than the industry median. Its non-GAAP forward price-to-earnings ratio is 40.12 times, and its forward enterprise value to EBITDA ratio is 34.79 times, both significantly higher than the industry median. However, when I look at the non-GAAP forward price-to-earnings ratio , it indicates that the valuation is undervalued by 27%. NVDA's price-to-earnings ratio is 1.38 times, while the industry median is 1.90 times. Based on the GAAP trailing 12-month PEG, the company's P/E ratio is 0.69 times, undervalued by 31% compared to the industry median. Ideally, I would say that most multiples look high in absolute terms, but compared to NVDA's 60.71% compound annual growth rate, the stock's valuation isn't as high as it appears.

In terms of peer comparison, I chose NVDA's closest competitors because Nvidia is already far ahead in terms of market capitalisation, so I chose Broadcom and AMD. I noticed that NVDA's price-to-earnings ratio and expected price-to-earnings ratio are still lower than its peers.

I believe that the biggest risk facing NVIDIA at present is geopolitical risk. Currently, there are many uncertainties between China and the United States, especially following the imposition of tariffs on Liberation Day and the U.S. government's decision to suspend exports of H20 GPUs to China. Such situations could recur and undermine NVIDIA's growth plans and market expansion efforts. Losing the Chinese market would have a significant impact on NVIDIA's business. Additionally, geopolitical events such as trade tariffs and sanctions could affect global supply or cloud computing spending in some of the key regions where NVIDIA operates. In conclusion, in this grand AI infrastructure game, NVIDIA is the queen. Currently, it is the most powerful and flexible piece on the board. Compared to peers that may occupy other key positions, NVIDIA controls every direction. For example, AMD is the rook, SMCI is the bishop, while Credo and Astera are agile knights. Ultimately, NVIDIA determines the pace and scope of this game. As AI demand continues to grow, NVIDIA's dominant position is further strengthened by the expansion of the Chinese market.",44,26,1753028984.0,2025-07-20T16:29:44+00:00,t3_1m4t8er,stocks

350,NVDA,Google’s AI Awakening: Earnings Bull Case,"# Beyond the AI hype, YouTube's dominance and a transforming Search business create a powerful, and potentially undervalued, growth story.

As Nvidia Corp. solidifies its position as a $4 trillion titan on the back of the AI hardware boom, a compelling debate is intensifying on Wall Street over what some see as a glaring valuation gap: Alphabet Inc., the parent company of Google.

While shares of the search giant have performed well, they have lagged the explosive, triple-digit gains of the companies building the ""picks and shovels"" of the AI revolution. This has led to a growing belief among some investors that Google, with its deeply integrated ""full stack"" of AI assets, is on the cusp of a significant re-rating. They are betting that the company’s upcoming second-quarter earnings report on July 23 will be the primary catalyst, forcing the market to shift its focus from the cost of Google's AI ambitions to the reality of its profits.

“For years, AI was a massive cost center for Google. The question for the second half of 2025 is whether it can become a massive profit center,” says one technology strategist. “Next week’s report is the first real test of that thesis.”

# The Unseen Competitor Winning the Streaming Wars

While investors have been fixated on Google's AI story, the recent earnings report from Netflix provided an inadvertent, and powerful, bull case for one of Google’s most valuable assets: YouTube.

Netflix’s management noted the intense competition for viewer engagement, and recent Nielsen data tells the story. In May, YouTube commanded 12.5% of all U.S. television screen time, significantly ahead of Netflix’s 7.5%. This data confirms that YouTube is not just a mobile video app, but the dominant media platform in the modern living room.

Financially, the scale is staggering. YouTube’s advertising revenue alone, at over $34 billion annually, is nearly the size of Netflix’s entire global enterprise. When combined with an estimated $19 billion in subscription revenue from YouTube Premium and YouTube TV, a hypothetical standalone “YouTube Inc.” would be a media behemoth with over $53 billion in annual sales, far outpacing its rivals.

“Netflix’s earnings call was inadvertently the best bull case for YouTube we’ve seen all year,” noted one portfolio manager. “It confirmed who truly owns the living room, and that value has yet to be fully unlocked in Alphabet’s stock price.”

# The Bear Case Reimagined: Search as an AI Utility

A persistent fear among investors has been that AI chatbots would cannibalize Google’s core Search business, which remains its primary source of profit. A contrarian view is now emerging, however, that AI will not be a threat, but rather Search's greatest accelerator.

This thesis posits that as Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI agents become more prevalent, they will need constant access to the live, indexed web to provide up-to-date, reliable information. The most efficient and trusted source for that data is Google's Search index.

Under this model, the biggest new customers for Google Search may not be humans, but other AIs. This could transform the Search business from a consumer-facing advertising platform into a foundational “Search as a Service” utility for the entire AI economy, monetized through high-margin, programmatic API access.

“The fear was that the search box would die,” says a tech strategist. “The reality may be that the underlying Search index becomes the foundational data layer for the entire AI ecosystem—a far more valuable position.”

# The Path to $3 Trillion

For Google to close the valuation gap with its peers, investors believe the market must recognize the value of its interconnected empire. A ""sum-of-the-parts"" analysis reveals immense potential: a dominant media company in YouTube, a profitable and growing Cloud business, and a portfolio of high-risk, high-reward ""Other Bets"" like the autonomous driving unit, Waymo.

The ultimate validation of its AI leadership could come from a partnership with its biggest rival. Persistent rumors of Apple integrating Google's Gemini into iOS for advanced AI tasks draw a direct parallel to the estimated $20 billion annual deal Google pays Apple for its search default status. Such a deal would instantly cement Gemini's position as the indispensable intelligence layer for the mobile world.

The narrative for the past year has rightfully celebrated the companies building the infrastructure for AI. The bull case for Google is a bet that the focus is about to shift to the companies that can most effectively monetize it. Investors will be watching closely on July 23rd for the answer.

  
**TL;DR:**

* **Google is likely undervalued.** The market has rewarded AI hardware companies like Nvidia but hasn't yet priced in Google's ability to profit from its ""full-stack"" AI ecosystem. The July 23rd earnings report is the key catalyst to prove this.
* **YouTube is quietly winning the streaming wars.** It has more viewing time than Netflix, making it a dominant media empire whose massive value is not fully reflected in Google's stock price.
* **The ""AI is a threat to Search"" narrative is likely wrong.** The opposite is more probable: AI agents will become massive new customers, using the Google Search index as the essential data layer for the entire AI economy, creating a new, high-margin business.
* **For the first time, real revenue from AI subscriptions (Gemini, Veo) will be reported.** This shifts the story from ""AI is an expense"" to ""AI is a profit engine.""
* **A potential multi-billion dollar deal for Apple to use Gemini** (similar to their current Search deal) is a massive, often overlooked catalyst that would cement Google's AI supremacy.

138,NVDA,Aeluma (ALMU) is X10 any way you look at it (semiconductor / AI datacenter / defense / quantum etc.) Providing a fundamental core principles solution (letting silicone chips grow their own quantum dot lights to transfer data at light speed).,"Aeluma (ALMU) is very under the radar now but wrapped up in the whole idea that AI data centers have reached hard limits due to electrons transferring information in copper where there are huge gains from transferring information with photons instead.

Now, lots of players do this photon info transfer stuff. Big ones like Intel, and funded startups (that NVDA funds) with hundreds of staff. But they all have tradeoffs.

Aeluma is really focusing on the core, most fundamental physics solution. Which is growing quantum lights directly on the chips in a way that's super cheap and already in mass production. So they grow basically little things on chips that can produce light due to quantum physics, and use that to transfer information around. If you've heard of POET they have a platform that lets you buy a great laser from one lab and smack it on a chip from another lab. But the real fundamental ""holy grail"" for material science is just growing light directly on the chip.

Can they do it? Yeah they now have contracts with department of defense, navy, etc. for submarine sensors. Since their sensors have better detection through fog and stuff when the subs put up a parascope. 1 second difference is all you need to win a submarine battle.

The CEO is former DARPA and he is super integrated there including through a program that will enable them to sell to Lockheed, Raytheon, etc. He also runs a quantum lab that google built their quantum computer. Literally their office is like 3 miles or something like that from Googles quantum lab.

And on to quantum they are selected by NASA to help build the quantum internet. E.g. they have actually received money to *commercialize* quantum entangled light chips so the whole solar system can be a connected quantum computer.

Let's see what else. They have a board member that was VP of finance as NVDA for like 30 years. Another investor is a noble laureate who invented the blue led... another investor is one of the top patent attorneys in the US... If you check their LinkedIn they are getting comments by Apples top engineer. Like these guys have a stellar team really really good team. They are already making revenue through defense contracts so they don't need to dilute stock... the operations are super nice and they partner with US fabricators for 100% US supply chain hence the DOD etc. starting to purchase.

A prominent analyst expects at least $10 upside and commercial contracts announced soonish. Says they are already in talks with 15 potential commercial customers... Right now their valuation is based on zero commercial customers. And the largest current risk is no commercial customers. I believe they will get commercial customers no problem. Which leads me to:

Mobile phones... the little notch / island things is a huge market over the next 2 years. Android will try to leapfrog Apple and ALMU's sensors can actually go through the OLED perfectly fine for facial recognition. So I've seen estimates these sensors are a 0$ market and in two years will be a 2$ billion market, and they are addressing this market.

They have other markets, AR/VR, Lidar and robotics sensors, other stuff. Remember this is a totally fundamental physics technology. Growing light directly on the chip so information can process at the speed of light. Think if META wants a manhatten size datacenter how important is the speed of data transfer when everything has to be parallel? It will for sure all go light instead of copper.

Anyway I see this stock easily 10X from 300M to 3B marketcap. We are in huge datacenter expansion still and this is fundamental tech that has traction and revenue. The next thing is there is huge precedence for large acquisitions from AMD, Intel, Broadcom, NVDA etc. optical semiconductor stuff is bought all the time for a few billion it's essentially part of their business model to spend a few billion in R&amp;D for this kind of full stack AI integration. And with only like 15\~\~ employees, great patent, team, etc. its such a target for aquisition. Also we have super low flow several million shares and \~40% insider ownership. All-time-highs keep touching at \~$20.

IMO this is a strong buy. 

Data:

**My idea for holding this stock in anticipation of growth to 1B mcap and acquisition announcement for 2-5X mcap \~\~ for 10-20X from current level in 1-3 years.**

* **Investment Thesis: High-Risk/High-Reward Acquisition Play**
   * Core bet: Aeluma (ALMU) undervalued at $286M market cap (as of 7/18/25 close), priced on early-stage financials, not strategic tech potential; up 136% YTD, 479% 1YR on momentum. Acquisition by NVIDIA/AMD/Intel could yield 5-10x returns via premium buyout (2-5x current cap), exploiting public-private valuation arbitrage vs. peers ($1B-$4.4B).

* **Market Opportunities: Multi-Billion TAM Across Verticals**
   * AI Datacenters ($10-40B): Breaks ""3m copper wall"" for &gt;100Gbps; cuts power to 1.5-2 pJ/bit (NVIDIA target). Optical I/O essential for scaling amid thermal limits; mkt to $35B by '32.
   * Mobile/Consumer ($2B+ SWIR by '27): Under-display 3D sensing for notch-free phones; 90% cost drop ($5K to $3-8/sensor); 12-18mo window for Android pre-Apple '26-27.
   * Quantum (Post-2035): On-chip entangled sources for NASA quantum internet; unhackable comms, distributed qubits; solves SWaP for space.
   * Aerospace/Defense (Core Driver): SWIR/visible integration for fog-piercing sensors; 12-sec naval detection edge; 265-500% YoY growth.
   * Long Tail: Auto LiDAR/ADAS, AR/VR tracking, 5G/6G optics, biomed imaging; platform diversifies beyond gov't.

   * Profitability: Net loss TTM -$3.15M (improving from -$4.56M FY24); EPS TTM -$0.26. EBITDA -$1.76M; R&amp;D focused \~$2.5M/yr.
   * Balance Sheet: Cash \~$3-4M (strong position per Q3 release); burn \~$400K/qtr = 8-10 qtr runway. EV \~$282M; trades at discount to peers despite momentum.
* **Competitive Landscape: Underdog with Unique Edge**
   * Peers Overvalued: Ayar Labs ($1B+, $372M funded; external lasers); Celestial AI ($2.5B, $589M; fabric); Lightmatter ($4.4B, $850M; compute). System-level; Aeluma's light source complementary, non-conflicting.
   * Intel: 8M hybrid circuits shipped; scale edge, but Aeluma MOCVD monolithic superior on cost/performance.
   * Differentiator: MOCVD scalability (billions LEDs/yr) vs. lab methods; capital-efficient (13 vs. 135-200 staff); fights via first-mover in monolithic.
* **Analyst Coverage &amp; Commercial Pipeline: Near-Term Catalysts**
   * Craig-Hallum: Initiated Buy (7/14/25), $26 PT (\~80% upside from $14.50 close); sees SAM $3B+ by 2030, higher with moonshots. Analyst notes highlight conversion of $15M+ gov't validation to commercial; spoke to \~15 customers/partners indicating strong pipeline interest.
   * Timeline: 3-9 mo for first commercial contracts/design wins; key to de-risking thesis, unlocking rev inflection beyond gov't (93% mix). Lack of public wins biggest risk; analyst views as catalyst window for traction in AI/mobile/defense.
* **M&amp;A Precedents &amp; Valuation Arbitrage**
   * Direct: AMD Enosemi ('25, undisclosed; SiPh for co-packaged); extends to Aeluma for monolithic advance. NVIDIA Mellanox ($6.9B interconnects); AMD Xilinx ($35B packaging/IP).
   * Photonics: Cisco Acacia ($4.5B optics); Marvell Inphi ($10B electro-optics); II-VI Coherent ($7.1B lasers). Multiples 3-6x rev for mature; Aeluma pre-comm warrants premium as IP ""option.""
   * Arbitrage: $286M cap vs. peers $1-4.4B; ignores strategic value. SOX NTM EBITDA 24x supports 3-6x rev benchmark; small float adds buyout pop potential.
* **Strategic Fit: Top Suitors NVIDIA/AMD/Intel**
   * AMD (Primary): Builds on Enosemi; leapfrogs NVIDIA in optical I/O for AI war; full-stack edge.
   * Intel (Secondary): Boosts IFS foundry with monolithic ""crown jewel""; dual product/customer use; parallels Tower Semi bid.
   * NVIDIA: Internalizes NVLink optics; cuts Ayar reliance; deep-tech buy history (Run:ai, Deci).
   * Others: Cisco/Marvell/Broadcom/Coherent for verticals; all driven by AI interconnect shift.",23,7,1752936680.0,2025-07-19T14:51:20+00:00,t3_1m3y40y,SmallStreetBets

203,NVDA,I Sold My Corvette for $78K and Went All-In on RMBS.,"Ticker: $RMBS
Position: Scaling into 1,000+ shares 
Conviction: Stronger than the LT4 torque curve
Catalyst: IP dominance in AI memory infrastructure nobody’s pricing in

🏎️ The Setup:

I sold my 2019 Sebring Orange Z06 — 2LZ, Kalahari interior, 5,955 miles of pure sauce — for $78K cash.

Why?

Because while everyone’s chasing gains in NVDA, AMD, and MU, I went full galaxy brain and bought the company that quietly gets paid every time those companies scale.

I didn’t just trade torque for tech.
I traded a car for compoundable alpha.

139,NVDA,Bull Case for Recursion Pharmaceuticals (RXRX),"This is my breakdown of why **I like this stock.** Many may disagree, but this is my logic. TLDR is at the bottom:

**Pioneering AI-Driven Drug Discovery in Biotech**

Recursion Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: RXRX) represents a compelling investment opportunity in the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and biotechnology. As a leader in leveraging AI to revolutionize drug discovery, Recursion is positioned to capitalize on the inefficiencies of traditional pharma R&amp;D, where over 90% of drug candidates fail. The company's Recursion Operating System (OS) stands out as a transformative platform, enabling faster, more efficient, and cost-effective development of novel therapeutics. This bull case focuses on Recursion's AI platform as a first-mover advantage in biotech and explores the diverse revenue streams it could unlock, potentially driving significant long-term growth for RXRX stock.

**The Recursion AI Platform: A Technological Moat**

At the core of Recursion's value proposition is its AI-powered Recursion OS, an integrated system designed for scaled drug discovery and development. The platform combines proprietary datasets exceeding 65 petabytes—encompassing phenomics (cell imaging), transcriptomics, InVivomics (in vivo data), proteomics, ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion), and de-identified patient data—with advanced robotics and computer vision. This allows Recursion to conduct millions of automated cell experiments weekly in its wet labs, generating vast amounts of high-dimensional biological data that feed into a self-improving AI feedback loop.

**Key technologies bolstering the platform include:**

**-Machine Learning Models:** Intelligent algorithms for rapid target identification and molecule design, predicting drug interactions and efficacy with unprecedented accuracy.

**-BioHive-2 Supercomputer:** Developed in collaboration with NVIDIA, this is biopharma's most powerful supercomputer, enabling massive computational scale. Which has recently been reported to be in the process of an upgrade from NVIDIA.

**-Boltz-2 AI Model:** A next-generation model, co-developed with MIT, that predicts binding affinity between molecules and targets at exceptional speed and precision.

These tools have demonstrated tangible efficiencies: Recursion claims to reduce the time and cost from hit identification to IND-enabling studies compared to industry averages, addressing the traditional 90% failure rate in drug development. By industrializing biology through AI, Recursion is not just accelerating discovery but also de-risking it, creating a scalable ""learning system"" where each successive drug candidate has a higher probability of success.

**First-Mover Advantage in the Biotech AI Revolution**

Recursion is widely regarded as a pioneer in AI-enabled drug discovery, often dubbed the ""NVIDIA of biotech"" for its foundational role in applying compute power to biological challenges. Founded in 2013, the company went public in 2021, raising $306 million in its IPO, and has since built a robust ecosystem that positions it ahead of competitors. Traditional drug discovery relies on hypothesis-driven approaches, which are slow, expensive (costing billions per approved drug), and prone to failure. Recursion's data-driven, AI-centric model flips this paradigm, using unbiased exploration of biological relationships to uncover novel insights that ""wouldn’t have come by human design.

**This first-mover status is amplified by strategic partnerships with industry giants:**

**-NVIDIA:** Collaboration on BioHive-2 and AI model development, providing access to cutting-edge GPU technology.

**-Exscientia:** Recent merger/combination enhancing AI capabilities, with early clinical wins like REC-617, where only 136 molecules were synthesized for a Phase 1 oncology candidate—dramatically reducing costs and timelines.

**-Other pharma leaders** (e.g., Bayer, Roche/Genentech): Multi-year deals for collaborative discovery in areas like fibrosis and oncology.

These alliances validate Recursion's platform and expand its reach, allowing it to tackle complex diseases while sharing risks. As AI adoption in biotech accelerates—fueled by broader trends like those seen in NVIDIA's ecosystem—Recursion's early lead could translate into market dominance, similar to how first movers in tech platforms (e.g., AWS in cloud computing) captured outsized value. Investor sentiment echoes this, with Recursion highlighted in recent features as laying the groundwork for industry-wide transformation.

**Revenue Potential:**

From Collaborations to Blockbuster Drugs Recursion's revenue model is multifaceted, evolving from partnership-driven income to high-margin pipeline commercialization. In Q1 2025, the company reported $15 million in revenue, primarily from collaboration agreements—a 7% year-over-year increase. Analysts project explosive growth, with revenue expected to surge from $58.8 million in 2024 to $263 million in 2027, implying a compounded annual growth rate This trajectory underscores the platform's scalability.

**Key revenue streams include:**

**1. Collaboration and Milestone Payments:** High-value deals with pharma partners provide upfront fees, research funding, and milestones (e.g., up to billions in potential payments per program). These are low-risk, recurring sources that fund internal R&amp;D while validating the AI platform.

**2. Pipeline Commercialization**: Recursion's internal pipeline targets oncology (e.g., REC-3565 for B-cell malignancies, now in Phase 1) and rare diseases (e.g., programs for familial adenomatous polyposis and hypophosphatasia). With candidates in preclinical to Phase 3 stages, successful approvals could generate billions in annual sales from first-in-class or best-in-class drugs. The true upside lies in long-term pipeline revenue, as AI reduces failure rates and speeds market entry.

**3. Licensing and Data Monetization:** The platform's datasets and AI models could be licensed to other biotechs or used for co-development, creating software-like margins. As Recursion builds a ""learning system,"" it could offer AI-as-a-service for drug discovery, tapping into the $100+ billion global pharma R&amp;D market.

**4. M&amp;A and Spinouts:** The recent Exscientia integration adds clinical assets and could lead to spinouts or acquisitions, unlocking additional value.

With $427.6 million in cash (potentially rising to $800 million post-merger) and a burn rate sustainable through 2027, Recursion has ample runway to execute. Positive pipeline updates, such as dosing the first patient in REC-3565 trials, have already driven stock gains of 5.5% in recent months.

**Why RXRX Could Be a Multi-Bagger**

In a market where AI is reshaping industries, Recursion's platform positions it to disrupt biotech's trillion-dollar opportunity. As a first mover, it benefits from network effects: more data improves AI, leading to better drugs and stronger partnerships. While risks like clinical failures exist, the bull case hinges on execution—delivering on pipeline milestones could trigger a re-rating, with some viewing RXRX as a ""millionaire-maker"" stock. For investors betting on AI's second wave in biotech, RXRX offers asymmetric upside, potentially turning today's modest revenue into tomorrow's blockbusters.

**TLDR:** AI driven drug discovery is a first in class technology, giving RXRX a chance to become a giant first mover if the company is managed and supported correctly.",10,26,1752853628.0,2025-07-18T15:47:08+00:00,t3_1m35uyv,SmallStreetBets

414,NVDA,nvidia valuation just doesn't make any sense to me,"It's at 4.2T right now. It's most valued company on the planet. Yet what do they exactly do? They /design/ compute chips.

Let that sink in - they design those chips, they don't even manufacture them.

Most of those chips today go to AI industry, they used to be a GPU industry leader, but today it's not about graphics anymore, it's just about AI compute. Graphics and gaming is a minor market for them, and companies like AMD can provide better gaming GPU cards for less money. So let's talk about the AI - because then you have companies like Intel and AMD, and Google with their own TPUs and then you have China which is according to various sources maybe about 2 - 5 years behind, but ultimately trying to be able to both design and manufacture such chips too.

So:

nvidia - valued at 4.2T capable only of designing powerful compute chips, being currently most popular by AI researchers because their CUDA software stack is already widely adopted and mature

Intel - valued at \~100B capable of **both designing and manufacturing** comparably powerful compute chips - not having so mature ecosystem as CUDA - yet  
AMD - valued at \~250B capable of only designing compute chips just as powerful as nvidia, only lacking in adoption of their software stack (ROCm) that they keep improving (they already provide accelerators cards even more powerful than nvidia)

TSMC - valued at 1.2T which is manufacturing for most of chip designers, now including even Intel (partially) that nvidia is totally dependent on

Then you have companies like Google and Cerebras that design their own silicon (again depending on TSMC just as everyone else, maybe except Chinese) that make chips far more powerful than nvidia does.

So where is this insane valuation of nvidia coming from? Is it just because they have a temporary leading edge in industry that just seems to be a top of all hype?

Because in few years they could literally become irrelevant in the AI world just as Nokia became irrelevant in the mobile phone world - the competition exists, has similar products, and it's only a matter of short time until software stacks for Intel and AMD GPUs get as much adopted in LLM / AI world as CUDA is.

Can someone help me understand this valuation?",0,50,1752764130.0,2025-07-17T14:55:30+00:00,t3_1m29pgv,stocks
114,NVDA,Nvidia could recoup as much as $15 billion in revenue with H20 sales to China set to resume,"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-could-recoup-as-much-as-15-billion-in-revenue-with-h20-sales-to-china-set-to-resume-100052288.html

&gt; Nvidia (NVDA) is set to recoup billions of dollars in revenue if the tech giant resumes sales of its AI chips to China as expected after a surprise export ban in April.

&gt; Wall Street analysts at Stifel, Bernstein, and William Blair said Nvidia could make up as much as $15 billion in revenue from China in the second half of the year to hit around $20 billion from the region for its 2026 fiscal year, which ends next January. That would be an uptick from its roughly $17 billion in sales from China in 2025.

&gt; Nvidia said Tuesday that it had received assurances from the Trump administration that it would be granted licenses to resume sales of its H20 chips to Chinese customers, sending the stock to a new record high.

&gt; Stifel analyst Ruben Roy raised his price target on Nvidia to $202 from $180 following the news, writing in a note to clients Tuesday that, given pent-up demand, there will ""likely be an accelerated cadence of H20 ingestion from China customers"" in the second half of the year.",461,57,1752763586.0,2025-07-17T14:46:26+00:00,t3_1m29h0v,stocks

117,NVDA,Wall Street steady again after Trump downplays threat to Fed Chair Jerome Powell's job,"Wall Street appears calm after President Donald Trump walked back his earlier threats to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.

Futures for the S&amp;P 500 were unchanged before the opening bell Thursday, while futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.2%. Nasdaq futures rose less than 0.1%, essentially flat.

Trump has harshly criticized Powell and his Fed colleagues for the decision to stand pat on interest rates at a time when the economy is broadly healthy and unemployment is low. Trump's new complaint about Powell  which he says could be grounds for firing the central bank chief  is about cost overruns on the $2.5 billion renovation project at the Fed's Washington headquarters.

Wall Street loves lower rates because they goose prices higher for stocks and other investments, and Trump himself has been clamoring for the Fed to cut more quickly. But Powell has insisted he wants to wait for more data about how Trump’s stiff tariffs will affect the economy and inflation.

Markets, as well as the dollar, took a quick dive Wednesday on reports that Trump was talking about terminating Powell, but largely recovered after he appeared to walk back those sentiments.

A number of companies early in the earnings season have been reporting strong performances, even as they cite uncertainty about the near future due to the potential impacts of Trump's tariffs.

PepsiCo shares rose 2% before the bell Thursday after the beverage and snack giant's second-quarter sales and profit topped Wall Street projections. PepsiCo reaffirmed its April guidance, which projected lower full-year profit than previous forecasts due to increased costs from tariffs and a pullback in consumer spending.

The world’s largest chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), reported huge increases in sales and profit from a year ago, sending its stock up 3.4% in early trading. However, TSMC, a major supplier for Nvidia (NVDA), warned that “uncertainties and risks from the potential impact from tariff policies exist.”

Shares of United Airlines (UAL), which reported after the bell Wednesday, dipped 1.6% overnight after the carrier's second-quarter revenue came in a touch lower than expected. United also cut its full-year profit guidance.

Also falling early Thursday are shares of Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM) and Ingredion, makers of high fructose corn syrup. President Donald Trump said Wednesday that Coca-Cola has agreed to use real cane sugar in its flagship soft drink in the U.S. at his suggestion  though the company has yet to confirm that.

Ingredion tumbled almost 6% early Thursday, and Archer-Daniels-Midland fell 3%.

TAIPEI (Reuters) -TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, posted a 60.7% jump in second-quarter net profit on Thursday, beating market forecasts and hitting a historic high as it benefited from surging demand for semiconductors used in artificial intelligence applications.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, whose customers include Apple and Nvidia, saw April-June net profit rise to T$398.3 billion ($13.53 billion).

The profit handily beat a T$377.9 billion LSEG SmartEstimate, which is weighted toward forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate.

So you will find only US/UK/Aus stock on this portfolio. Sorry it's in french but you will understand easily. I hide some information about how much i put on these stocks.

my dream : sell everything and keep only 4 stocks with the best entry possible. Because i was f...ed by Euro/Dollars change (more than 14% of loss in addition)

My biggest mistake is to try to use my brain and try to fit my stock with the economic trend. Finally, i should have only followed the trend of reddit : Rocket lab, ast space, one quantum stock, circle and robinhood, and i would be richer than today ...

Some explanation of my portfolio :

\- AI stock : so i took Arista as leader of networking for AI data center, Marvell for custom chipset and their strong position in this sector (google, amazon and some other big cap company). And Vertiv for the part of cooling data center. I got Nvidia and Amazon but i sold before 2 april and during deepseek. I got Coreweave, TSS inc and Nebius, both make me money, i just follow reddit trend, and that works sometime

\- Energy : Trump wanted to open the market of LNG for the world and this energy is used for data center. So i took cheniere and kinder morgan, that doesn't move, it's blocked. I take ITM power for Green Hydrogen, but the stock is dropping hard since i bough it (-20% in one week)

\-Gold : i take Genesis minerals, the stock is dropping too while gold begin its rally. Why ? i don't know...

  
I got Arista, Cheniere, Kinder Morgan, and Marvell since the early year.

352,NVDA,"Intel bagholders, I got one question for you...","Why aren't you buying more?

While you regards are circle jerking over NVIDIA's $4T market cap, Jensen is furiously dumping shares to add to his personal jacket collection. Meanwhile, Intel is playing the long game.

NVIDIA's GPU dominance is built on training hype and datacenter porn, but they're about to get steamrolled by the most predictable trend in computing history: eventually, everything runs on a fucking potato.

Here's what's really happening, GPUs weren't designed for AI, AI was designed around GPUs. We're literally running neural networks on graphics cards because that's what was available, not because it's optimal. Now that specialized training and inference hardware is coming, this whole house of cards falls apart.

Not every company is training GPT-5. Only for the top players does this even make sense. The real money isn't in the repurposed graphics cards powering today's model training. It's in the purpose-built, boring-ass processors that'll run AI inference on every toaster, doorbell, and sex toy in existence. And Intel is positioning to own that world.

# Dismantling NVIDIA's hype

Let me break this down for you mouth-breathers. Most of you have no idea what CUDA actually is or why it doesn't matter. The funny thing is neither do the companies or their developers building these AI models using it.

I'm a Platform Engineer. Which means I'm the poor bastard who has to productionize and scale the garbage that AI teams try to ship. Let me tell you, most AI ""engineers"" code like toddlers with crayons. It's embarrassing.

Picture this, you've got these script kiddies sitting in their Herman Miller chairs, MacBook Pros gleaming under the open office lighting, staring lovingly at their golden NVIDIA GPUs like they're some sort of religious artifacts. Like you, to these ape-like engineers, CUDA is simply magic. A godlike ethereal force aligning all the fairy dust just right in their $40,000 golden shrine to Jensen.

But it isn't.

CUDA is just a C++ extension with some runtime libraries. That's it. The ""moat"" everyone keeps parroting about doesn't exist because ALL the software frameworks used in the industry support multiple backends. PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX, they all run on AMD, Intel, custom silicon, whatever. The hardware is completely abstracted away. Most developers never even know what backend they're running on.

These people have zero concept of basic software engineering principles, let alone understanding the backend infrastructure their code runs on. They're statisticians and researchers who learned to use a computer the same way a medieval alchemist learned to use fire.

They believe that if it runs on their MacBook, it's production ready. They write code like they're still submitting homework assignments, except now their homework is burning through millions in compute costs.

# A Fundamental Shift is Coming

At the moment, companies everywhere are conflating training requirements with inference requirements like they're the same thing.

I've seen production deployments at major companies that would make any competent engineer weep. Burning millions per year on H100s because they can't differentiate between development and production requirements. Companies treating every ML workload like they're training GPT-5.

These deployments only exist because companies throw unlimited capex budgets at fundamentally misunderstood architectures just to get a ticket on the AI hype train. But it's not sustainable.

Training requires massive parallel compute for backpropagation. Fine, NVIDIA won that round with their Ferrari hardware. But the market is shifting from training to inference, and inference has completely different optimization requirements.

Inference is single forward passes that need to be cheap, consistent, and efficient, not just fast. A Llama model classifying support tickets doesn't need a $25,000 H100. It needs cost-effective compute that can handle steady loads without breaking the bank. These workloads are perfectly suited for whoever can deliver the best price to performance story. Literally anyone else but NVIDIA.

You can only burn through VC money and corporate budgets for so long before someone starts asking uncomfortable questions. The corporate bean counters are getting nosy about what these ""AI initiatives"" are actually producing for their massive compute spend. When finance realizes they're paying Ferrari prices for Honda Civic workloads, the free money party ends fast. And where does it go? To Intel, AMD, and every custom silicon vendor with a better price-to-performance story.

Remember DeepSeek? When they claimed comparable performance using 2,048 H800s versus competitors' 10,000+ H100s, NVIDIA lost $589 billion in market value in one day. That wasn't market overreaction. That was the market briefly glimpsing reality about AI efficiency.

If that's the market reaction to a boost in training efficiency, imagine what happens when the inference efficiency story becomes undeniable.

Specialized inference chips are already showing 5-20x performance improvements over general-purpose GPUs. When companies realize they can run their workloads on cheaper, more efficient hardware, the migration will be swift and brutal for NVIDIA's margins.

Intel's Gaudi 3 baseboards are delivering 2.9x better price performance to NVIDIA's H100 baseboards.

Meanwhile, Intel trades like a dying company when they're positioned to capture the massive inference market that everyone's ignoring. The technical setup screams bottom, the valuation is absurd, and the fundamental shift is accelerating.

# The Trade:

Positions:

INTC 2600 shares, selling covered calls every other week, selling puts with available cash as collateral.

The way I see it, you're getting paid to wait on a potential 2-3x if the turnaround works. And if it doesn't, you're buying below tangible book value while NVIDIA holders watch their gains evaporate.

INB4 ""why aren't you buying puts on NVIDIA?"":

Listen, that stock has more momentum than a freight train on cocaine. Maybe it keeps ripping to $300 while I'm crying into my positions. But physics applies to stonks too, and what goes parabolic eventually comes back to earth.

I'd rather bet on the inevitable winner of the post-hype reality than try to time the peak of an irrational bubble.

142,NVDA,So Nvidia can deliver its H20 processors to China..,"Hi everyone,

I don’t know if you remember the deal signed with China to return to 30% tariffs (basically, back to square one). Trump implied that China only got low tariffs and the right to send students to American universities in exchange. However, in return, Trump secured 0% tariffs on exports to China and the right to import rare earths under license.

  
Then, strangely, several pieces of news went unnoticed, like the authorization to deliver AI-related software to China. And now the H20 processors, whose performance was highlighted during the boom of Chinese AI, particularly with Deepseek.

  
So, naturally, we’re surprised that Trump didn’t dare announce that American tech is once again accessible to China. But is this really just a return to the starting point, or does this deal open the floodgates to further concessions on U.S. tech?

  
Because the H20 processors were already made by China to comply with Biden’s decree. Trump wanted an even more restrictive decree.",136,33,1752621305.0,2025-07-15T23:15:05+00:00,t3_1m0wx1j,StockMarket

353,NVDA,$CRWV My Investment Strategy,"As a longtime investor in the AI infrastructure track, I've taken a deep dive into CoreWeave's acquisition of CoreScientific and have come to a different conclusion than the market. Let me share my complete thought process.

First, I carefully analyzed the core value of the deal. By acquiring CoreScientific, CoreWeave will gain 1.34 GW of off-the-shelf data center capacity and an additional 700 MW of expansion space. This opened my eyes to several key advantages:

1: Up to $500 million in annual lease cost savings

2: Complete control over data center design and operations, enabling greater flexibility to serve AI customers

3: Anticipated $350 million in new hosting revenue by 2026

The market's reaction to this deal baffles me. The reasons for the stock's decline I would summarize as three:

1: Investors are concerned about the equity dilution effect

2: Doubts about CoreScientific's digital currency business

3: Disapproval of the asset-heavy operating model

But my research came to a different conclusion. In my opinion.

Equity dilution is a short-term effect, with significant integration benefits in the long term

Digital currency business only accounts for a small part, the core value is in data center assets

The asset-heavy model builds a more solid competitive barrier in the AI era instead.

I particularly value CoreWeave's unique advantages:

1: Deep cooperation with NVIDIA, first to deploy Blackwell chips

2: Obtaining long-term large orders from OpenAI and Microsoft

3: Specialized AI cloud service capabilities

Based on the price targets ($150-200) from organizations such as Argus and Mizuho, I believe the current $145 share price is significantly undervalued. My investment strategy is:

1: Gradually build a position before the end of the lockup period

2: Target to hold for 6-12 months and wait for integration benefits to emerge

3: Set a 10% stop-loss level to control risk.

Of course, I am also aware of the potential risks

Too much dependence on large customers such as OpenAI

Data center construction may not be as expected

Increased competition in the AI industry

However, after weighing the overall situation, I still decided to increase my position. Because I believe

1: AI infrastructure is the most certain track in the next 5 years

2: CoreWeave's first-mover advantage is obvious

3: The current valuation has sufficient margin of safety

This is the complete logic of my investment in CoreWeave. Although the stock price may continue to fluctuate in the short term, I am confident in its long-term performance. I will continue to track the company's integration progress and earnings performance, and adjust my position strategy as appropriate

My bet:

20 shares of CRWV

120,NVDA,NVDA eyes fresh highs as China sales may resume,"Looks like NVDA is back in the headlines (when is it not?)  this time with a shot at reclaiming lost ground in China

After months of silence and billions in lost revenue, Nvidia just said it's applying to resume sales of its H20 AI chips in China. The US government apparently ""assured"" them that licenses will be granted  which, if true, is a massive shift from the strict bans we saw earlier this year. Shares are ripping in premarket

What’s wild is that this comes just weeks after Jensen Huang met with Trump. Now he's in Beijing for a media briefing. Coincidence? Maybe. But the timing feels... calculated

Also worth noting: AMD is jumping too, riding Nvidia’s coattails and signaling that it might get the same green light. So maybe Washington's stance on AI chips to China is softening a bit?

Of course, even if deliveries resume, it’s unlikely to impact Nvidia’s current quarter much  too little time left. But if they can get chips flowing in Q3 and Q4, that’s a whole different story

Nvidia was already on a tear after breaking that $4T milestone, and now this could add more fuel. If they can recapture even part of that China demand, it could be another big leg up  Does this feel like a short-term bump, or a full-on policy pivot that could open the floodgates again?",74,10,1752585111.0,2025-07-15T13:11:51+00:00,t3_1m0he5b,stocks

News: [US CPI Report For June](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2025-07-15/us-cpi-report-for-june?srnd=homepage-americas)

[**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&amp;p=d)/AMD- NVDA/AMD is now allowed to sell its previously restricted H20/MI308 chips to China after gaining U.S. government approval. This reopens a major demand pipeline and removes a significant geopolitical overhang, boosting investor sentiment around long-term growth prospects. NVDA has hit ATH from this, I'm more interested in AMD today as a trade though just because it's run down compared to NVDA, but I'm interested in seeing if NVDA can break $170. The export clearance marks a shift in U.S. posture toward China and semiconductors and the AI race, suggesting trade tensions are entering a more flexible phase and all that money Jensen ""donated"" to Trump is paying off. This benefits high-end chipmakers, namely AMD/NVDA the most.

[**BABA (Alibaba)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&amp;p=d)/KC/FXI/all Chinese stocks- The chip export announcement has been interpreted as Trump easing his stance on China, sparking a rally across most Chinese equities. BABA was up nearly 6% premarket, and I'm mainly interested in seeing if we can break daily highs in BABA today, other than that I'm also watching KC, a Chinese datacenter stock. Main risk is that Trump reverses his stance- the TACO trade can cut both ways.

[**MP (MP Materials)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MP&amp;p=d)\- The Department of Defense agreed to buy $400M in MP's newly issued preferred stock, taking a 15% stake in the company last week. AAPL is expected to announce a $500M commitment to MP, signaling ""deepening partnerships to localize critical rare-earth supply chains"" (this was announced on FOX news).

419,NVDA,AI is overvalued,"I am going to preface this with the fact I have worked in the AI field with some big companies for about 10 years now and understand everything about AI and how it works. 

I think a AI bubble is here, we are overvalueing every company that seems to use AI for the sole reason that it uses AI. We are creating a bubble of artificial valuation. AI has many uses and I do believe we will continue using it in the future, but that does not mean it is now the most powerful market indicator. The value of AI companies should be based on the integration value. Why does every AI company hit huge numbers shortly after the launch. It makes no sense. The whole point of valuation is how much shareholder value can they provide and with many of these new companies that number is real low. We are throwing money at these useless AI companies for absolutely no reason. We can look at a example of OpenAI. They are at the cutting edge of LLM  technology. It is never going to become the next ""Google"" and while I do think it is amazing what they do and I use Chatgpt often, why does everyone say they are undervalued. It isn't a trillion dollar company. That is just one dumb example though. The real overvaluation is the 75% of AI companies that are truly useless. We will always use AI in the future as a society, but it won't be a million companies, it will be the best of the best that we use for everything. 

There are countless AI companies that all think because they use AI they are the future, and we do fall for it. I think that in the near future there will be a AI burst. The bubble will finally collapse, it will hit everyone harder than we would ever expect. I have no idea when its going to happen, could be this year, could be next, and could be in 5 years. The overvaluation of AI is at least 50% artificial. 

Shorting AI might sound stupid, and it could be I am totally wrong, but what if I am right. 

Edit: I am not talking about the big hitters in the AI industry. The OpenAI, Palantir, Nvidia are all huge and extremely impactful. I am solely saying these are the companies that will survive. They are so ahead of everyone else that in 1 day they can teach a model to do virtually anything. Other companies will be forced to die out. This is just my prediction for the future of AI.

420,NVDA,The future of film. Netflix or some other company?,"Netflix has announced that they will begin showing AI generated ads in 2026. It's pretty clear what happens from there. What starts as 15-30 second AI-generated advertisements shown in the middle of your favorite TV series eventually evolves into 40-50 minute AI-generated episodes that *become* your new favorite TV series.

At some point in the not too distant future, and perhaps sooner than you think, the major streaming platforms will start rolling out feature-length films and TV series created entirely with AI. Over time, the quality will improve to be indistinguishable from real life.

The future of film is not in big budget productions with a cast of A-list stars. The future of film is in AI-generated content, created for pennies on the dollar and with very few human actors. Movies and series will be produced not over several months or years on set at some studio in Hollywood but in a few days or hours from who knows where. Like Bibles with the introduction of the printing press, they'll be produced in the thousands.

And companies can limit their exposure to risk by shifting to an On Demand model. Sure, there will be established franchises like Marvel and Star Wars and others they'll keep dishing out, but long gone will be the days when a studio drops $150M on a movie that flops.

Because the future of film won't be just Netflix Original content (or another company's), much of it will be *your* content. You'll have the power of Gen AI at your fingertips.

It won't be long until you can log into Netflix or another platform, and with a simple prompt or a choice of a few options, generate an entire film or TV series that you can watch that day and share with your friends. User content will be circulated and rated like your aunt's potato salad recipe on Allrecipes.com.

Movies are inherently procedural. Every story, at least a decent one, has:

* Structure (Freytag's pyramid, Three-act Play, The Hero's Journey, etc)
* Plot (Rags to Riches, Overcoming the Monster, Comedy, Tragedy, and Rebirth, etc)
* Theme (Love, Good vs Evil, Coming of Age, etc)
* Tone (Serious, Uplifting, Bleak, etc)
* Conflict (Man vs Man, Man vs Society, Man vs Nature, etc)
* Characters (Humans, Elves, Demons, Robots, Zombies, etc)
* Setting (Present Day, Apocalyptic, Alternate Dimension, Mars, etc)

You'll be able mix and match all of these elements and generate a prompt. BOOM - you have a new film or TV series that you'll be the first to view. Give it a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and Netflix will learn from your prompt and produce better recipes tailored just for you. You'll be able to share it with your friends on Netflix too. Top rated user content will be owned by Netflix who can sell it or rent it. Maybe they'll give you a percentage of the profit.

If you want a franchise with 20 movies, you'll have it. If you want TV series with 50 seasons, you'll have it.

So, what could the future look like?

Netflix has a current market cap of $529B with subscriptions priced between $7.99 and $24.99/mo. It's not unrealistic to double, triple, or even quadruple these costs to provide what I just described. As a millennial, I remember paying $70ish for cable 10-15 years ago. You have to believe people will be willing to pay a similar cost for On Demand film.

Is it unrealistic to forecast Netflix with a market cap of $2T?

Perhaps it's Google (Alphabet), not Netflix who will capitalize on this - and they won't just stick to movies and series. They'll evolve YouTube into a Generative AI hub. Create film, series, vlogs, and more. Veo3 is impressive. How much more capable will it be in 10 years?

If Nvidia is building ""AI factories"" to produce off-the-shelf AI models, then on-demand AI film is not so far fetched.

They say Tom Cruise saved Hollywood with Top Gun 2. I believe he only bought them a bit of extra time.",26,41,1752503214.0,2025-07-14T14:26:54+00:00,t3_1lzntu4,stocks

Despite escalating trade tensions with fresh tariff threats against the EU and Mexico, U.S. markets display resilience ahead of the critical earnings season kickoff. Mega-cap tech stocks maintain leadership with modest gains, while industrial and packaging sectors show some weakness amid global uncertainty. Analyst sentiment remains predominantly bullish on select growth and infrastructure plays, with strong buy ratings and price target raises for companies like Roblox, NextDecade, and Eli Lilly. Caution is advised as geopolitical risks and tariff impacts unfold in the near term, but overall technical signals support a continued cautiously optimistic market trajectory.

This week started with tariff concerns and ended with tariff concerns. Throughout the week, Trump announced lots of new tariffs on countries and commodities. 

📊 Here are the S&amp;P 500's week-by-week results for the last 4 week,

June 13 close at 5,976.97 - June 20 close at 5,967.84 🔴 (-0.15%)

June 20 close at 5,967.84 - June 27 close at 6,173.07 🟢 (3.44%)

June 27 close at 6,173.07 - July 3 close at 6,279.35 🟢 (1.72%)

July 3 close at 6,279.35 - July 11 close at 6,259.75 🔴 (-0.31%)

🔸 Monday: The week started under the tariff concerns, so the stock market opened lower. Before the session, Scott Bessent said we're going to have several trade announcements in next 48 hours. China released gold reserves data and showing it has been buying gold for 8-months. During the session, Trump announced 25% tariff on South Korea and Japan starting August 1. Also, he announced 40% on Nyanmar, 30% on South Africa, 40% on Laos. As a result, the stock market closed down nearly 1%. 🔴

🔸 Tuesday: The stock market opened flat. We've seen lots of times this opening in the week. Trump said August tariff deadline ""not 100% firm"", but he changed him thoughts and he said deadline won't extended. He also said we're going to send more weapons to Ukraine. Meanwhile, he said 50% tariff on copper and 200% tariff on pharmaceuticals. Elon Musk announced the launch of the 'America Party' and Tesla dropped more than 7%. The stock market closed lower again. 🔴

🔸 Wednesday: The stock market higher as await trade talks. Trump announced 7 more tariff letters. Also, he continued to attack Powell for rate cuts. The Nasdaq closed record and Nvidia became the first company a $4T milestone. Impressive. The EU commision said it aims to reach a trade deal before August 1. EU progress still slow. The stock market closed higher. 🟢

🔸 Thursday: The stock market opened flat again. Trump announced 50% tariff on Brazil. It could impact on coffee prices. Gold and Silver continued to rise, but Silver is the star of the week. Interestingly, jobless claims came in below expectations. Fed’s Daly expects two rate cut in 2025. These news lifted the stock market upper and closed positive. 🟢

🔸 Friday: Trump announced a tariff 35% on Canada. The stock market opened lower. Silver surged to $38.50 and its highest level since 2011. Trump continued to attack Powell, but he said that asked if he'll fire Powell and said No. The stock market closed lower. 🔴

The S&amp;P 500 broke 2-week winning streak. Tariff concerns are headlines, but the stock market did not respond highly this before. If there's positive news from EU, Canada or China, it can help to lift the stock market. There was a heavy news flow, but the stock market was quiet. What do you think? How was your week?

228,NVDA,$1.4m --&gt; $5.4m in 18 Months - 85% in Cash Now,"I've lost a lot of sleep over the past 18 months trading my mom's IRA (she's more than ok with this!), and I've been able to substantially outperform the market.  I lost most of her portfolio 3 months ago in April (bottom tick was $800k) but have been able to grow it back to a much higher value than it was before the tariff BS.

Total gains in 18 months: $4,000,000

I have been trading options (obviously, this is WSB.) For the first 6 months, my big winner was HIMS, although I sold WAY too early. I bought calls around $10 and sold around $20-$24. My other big plays have been scalping NVDA and especially GOOGL. Despite being a lousy hold for the last year, I've consistently YOLO'd into GOOGL on big pull backs, including the Apple congressional testimony news (Google searches were down for the first time on Safari, although Google denied this.)

My strategy is to buy near or at-the-money calls 2-5 months out with at least one earnings in between. I don't usually hold through earnings. I try to scale out of the position over the course of 2-10 trading days. I'm happy with 20%-50% gains and am fine with leaving money on the table. Because the calls are many months out, there isn't too much theta decay if the stock goes sideways.

I generally keep cash on the side to YOLO into calls if there's a huge overreaction on a given ticker. If I'm fully invested, it's hard to take advantage of certain opportunities. I don't think I have that much patience, but I've definitely improved since my early trading days.

On Friday I sold most of the portfolio and am now 85%  in cash. The other 15% is in QQQ puts and UNH calls. I think there will be buying opportunities soon given the new EU / Canada tariff news, but ultimately, as we all know, taco's gonna taco.",17773,867,1752339303.0,2025-07-12T16:55:03+00:00,t3_1ly582b,wallstreetbets
123,NVDA,Lump sump vs swing trading over years for growth stock,"I thought it would be smart to learn swing trading by analyzing technical chart (MACross, MACD lines), it looks good in short trend but in long trend, it seems it cannot beat just put all money (lump sump) in the beginning and forget about it.

  
For example: assume I invested  $10 000 to NVDA stock in beginning of 2020, after 5 years, it gained 1,473.66% which means I would have $147 366 now.

This allin method has advantages:

\- Much bigger gain than swing trading? I have this conception but it is good if some swing traders can confirm that.

\- No tax paid over years (big gains!) compared to swing tradings which I would need to pay tax (in EU) from capital gain

  
What do you think?

No Hedge, No Braincells, Just AI-Induced Delusion","Today I did the financial equivalent of freebasing AI hype and slapping the buy button like it wronged my ancestors. 500 contracts. $CRWV 150C. Expiring next Friday. Because nothing says “emotional stability” like lighting $27K on fire for a company that sounds like a crypto rug pull dressed in a Patagonia vest.

Do I have a plan? Sort of. The plan is Wall Street suddenly remembers CoreWeave is the unofficial dealer for every AI junkie in Silicon Valley. The plan is that Nvidia wakes up feeling flirty and drags the entire sector with it. The plan is that something literally anything sends this stock full anime power up mode and rips it $20+ by next Friday. That’s the plan. Is it good? Absolutely not. But it’s mine.

My thesis? It’s AI. It’s hot. It’s underloved. It’s due. If $NVDA can hit $1400 off vibes and a Midjourney slideshow, then CoreWeave can absolutely rip on pure speculation and caffeine.

If it hits? I walk into a SoftBank yacht party like I belong there and soft launch my fund: Delusional Vibe Capital.
If it doesn’t? I explain to my mom why her retirement is now tied up in something that sounds like a League of Legends champion.

My entire investment strategy is basically “trust the vibes, ignore the Greeks.”

146,NVDA,"$AMD is in a deep drawdown, having lost more than half its value from April 2024 to April 2025 ($180 –&gt; $103 !!)","The drawdown is in contrast to its competitor(in GPUs), $NVDA, which has risen 26% over the last year.

**There are a few reasons for the drawdown:**

• In Q2’24, AMD’s gaming hardware revenue dropped by 59% due to a fall in demand for semi-custom chips used in PlayStation &amp; Xbox.

• While it’s doing better than Intel in CPUs, it’s lagging behind NVIDIA in GPUs

• AMD’s MI-series accelerators struggled to gain traction against NVIDIA’s well-entrenched CUDA software ecosystem and superior performance, raising doubts about AMD’s ability to catch up in AI GPUs.

**But**, a lot has changed in 3 months. ​​From its bottom in April, the stock is now up 57%!

**Here's why I think $AMD is gonna come back:**

• They delivered a strong first-quarter earnings that beat expectations. Revenue is up 36% YoY, and data center sales rose 57%.

• The company launched its new Instinct MI350 series, which claims to have 60% more memory than Nvidia chips, and can create 40% for every dollar spent.

• AMD announced a $6 billion buyback program and a string of quick acquisitions focused on AI (Brium &amp; Untether)

To everyone who is concerned that Nvidia is too far ahead and too big for AMD to compete, don’t forget that AMD managed to beat Intel in processor performance. 

Just 10 years ago, in 2015, Intel was worth $150 billion and AMD was worth only $2 billion. Today, AMD has 3x the market cap of Intel.

147,NVDA,Taking money from index fund to buy a stock,"At the beginning of this year I decided to buy an individual stock for the first time; up until that time I had always been in index funds only. So on Jan 6, 2025 – not having any liquid cash available – I took $20,000 (4% of my IRA) from my S&amp;P 500 index fund FXAIX, and bought 131.656 shares of NVIDIA at $151.91 a share. My timing turned out to be horrible – NVDA started dropping after that, for the next few months, and didn't recover back to my cost basis of 151 until Jun 25th.

On July 8th when it hit 160, at that point my NVDA shares were worth $21,000, and being up $1,000, I figured I had reached the ""break even point."" In that, if I had left the $20,000 in FXAIX, I also would have been up close to $1,000 during this same time period of Jan 6 - July 8. (FXAIX was up +4.18% during that period. $20,000 X +4.18% = $836.)

I plan on holding NVDA long term, so at this point, going forward if it continues to deliver anything like its historical annual returns:

(10 year average annual return: 78.29%)

(20 year average annual return: 39.11%)

then this will have been a good move for me – taking money from an index fund to buy a stock.

Or am I wrong? Am I missing something? Are my calculations incorrect? Should you always make a move only when you have the liquid cash available? Or is it ever a good idea to take dollars from a fund like I did just to buy a stock?

  
EDIT: Some good responses and advice, thanks.

And I'm aware of the basic point that picking individual stocks is gambling, not investing, etc.

That's why I took just 4% of my IRA. With that small amount I'm perfectly willing to do the reallocation, take the risk, and trade the stability and long-term compounding of my S&amp;P 500 index fund for the higher upside potential of NVDA.

That said, I know the GENERAL answer to my question simply boils down to whatever the future holds. If over time NVDA does in fact deliver higher returns than FXAIX, then this was a good move for me to make.

I guess what I'm looking for is a SPECIFIC answer to my question – from the standpoint of ""buying method."" Buying a stock like I did with money taken from another fund, vs. buying it with liquid cash (if I had had some available). From an INVESTING PERSPECTIVE, is there anything inherently different about these two buying methods? For example, maybe there's some aspect of investing where there's a clear downside to taking the money from a fund (selling $20,000 of FXAIX like I did), that would rule out ever doing it that way? Or, is it such that the buying method in and of itself is irrelevant, and that it all really boils down to is the stock's performance over time?",3,18,1752253613.0,2025-07-11T17:06:53+00:00,t3_1lxceda,StockMarket

# One ETF That Caught My Eye: KOID (KraneShares Humanoid &amp; Embodied AI ETF)

I don’t own it (yet), but I’ve been tracking KOID closely. It's the first ETF I’ve seen that is **dedicated entirely to the humanoid and embodied AI ecosystem**. What's unique

125,NVDA,Trump posted: ‘The stock market is at an all-time high and interest rates should be cut immediately’!,"Former U.S. President Donald Trump just posted heavy rhetoric on social media, praising tech, industrial stocks and cryptocurrencies for their big gains and strongly calling on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. Let's break down what he said and analyze the current state of the market with the latest data. Tech stocks, industrial stocks, Nasdaq hit record highs, cryptocurrencies “break through the sky” Nvidia (NVDA) is up 47% since the tariffs, the U.S. made hundreds of billions of dollars from the tariffs the country came back and called on the Fed to immediately cut interest rates declaring that “there is no inflation” .

How does the market interpret this?

Expectations for rate cuts are heating up: inflation is falling back + political heat is rising in a campaign year, Trump's statement may create some public pressure on the Fed (although its independence remains).

Tariffs negative turned positive? : Despite initial concerns that the market was under pressure, from the perspective of capital rotation, industrial, AI and defense stocks have risen, and it seems that the “Made in the USA” narrative is stronger.

Nvidia became a symbol: as the AI concept leader, NVDA after the tariffs rose against the trend, became the representative of the “no fear of policy uncertainty”, ARM, SMCI, AVGO, etc. also strengthened, the whole AI plate into the “revaluation period”.

Follow-up possible trend?

If the next Fed officials do not rush to suppress the rate cut expectations, the market may be the following scenarios

 Long beneficiary direction: tech giants (NVDA, MSFT, GOOGL), interest rate sensitive growth stocks (ARKK, SMH), industrial/infrastructure stocks (CAT, DE, GE)

Risks to watch out for: QQQ/SPY technicals are close to overheating, Powell or other officials release hawkish letters, earnings season is approaching, and there could be a “positive cash-out-on-decline” 

What do our Reddit friends think?

Do you think Trump is just “rubbing it in” or is the impact of his policies really being priced into the market?

Will the Fed turn dovish under this political pressure?

423,NVDA,"Tech Leads Market Rebound, But Trade Tensions Signal Trouble Ahead","Markets rallied yesterday on the back of tech strength particularly Nvidia, which became the first U.S. company to cross a $4 trillion market cap. But while equities surged, serious macro risks are developing under the surface.

President Trump announced new tariffs: 

50% on copper imports starting Aug 1

20–30% on seven other countries

50% on *all* Brazilian imports a move explicitly framed as political retaliation, not trade-related.

This matters: Brazil is the U.S.'s largest coffee supplier. Expect prices to rise and broader trade flows to feel the shock in coming months.

Meanwhile, investor sentiment has reached *extreme greed* levels. Many are ignoring the macro risk buildup, chasing short-term gains driven by FOMO. We've seen this movie before.

Fed minutes from June show clear internal disagreement. Some are open to cuts as early as July; others want to wait until 2025. My take: Powell will follow the market’s lead and deliver a cut in September not just because of inflation trends, but because growth is clearly weakening under the surface, especially with tariff headwinds incoming.

 I'm cautious here. Many indexes are now overbought, and lower-quality small caps are getting dragged into the rally a classic late cycle sign. It's time to trim risk, not chase momentum.

Q1 2025 revenue reached $44.06B, up 69% y/y; of which data center revenue was $39.1B, up 73% y/y. ytd stock price rose 21%, more than triple in 3 years, the market is optimistic about continued expansion in the next 2 years.

Pullback pressure and potential risks: export restrictions impact: up to $8B of China sales are restricted, short-term profits and revenue there is a non-negligible disturbance 

valuation height: although a number of institutions still maintain a Strong Buy, the target price is mainly concentrated in the $174-$190 range, the potential upside space is limited.

Competition and macro uncertainty: AMD, Broadcom and other rivals continue to force, and the global economy, interest rates and policy may become uncertain launch factors.

My short-term technical outlook and market observation 

If the US market pulls back due to macro risks, NVDA will also be under short-term retracement pressure.

Resistance: $164.7-165 range highs are key, breakout could trigger a rally to $175-190. 

Support: $155-160. If broken, be wary of technical corrective pressure.

My view 

Long term holders: 

NVDA has AI “No. 1” status, architecture + chip + software ecosystem is mature, government and enterprise AI continues to expand, valuation is high but the next 3 years there is still a lot of room for growth.

Short-term traders: 

current position between resistance and support, high valuation stage, if touch export restrictions or macro negative, or 5-10% retracement opportunities. If it breaks $165, short-term follow-through long can be considered.

Conclusion Summary: 

Supporting factors: Blackwell chip architecture, AI demand continues to explode, government programs pushing Sovereign AI levels up, strong earnings.

Risk factors: export ban, valuation near record highs, increased competition, macroeconomic uncertainty.

What do you think?

Is the global government embrace of AI a bubble or a trend?

Will NVDA correct again in the short term? At what price would you take a position?

July’s early rebound in investor risk appetite, coupled with fading geopolitical concerns and the Fed’s cautious signals on future rates, supports a cautiously bullish view on equities. Technology and AI sectors continue to lead gains despite trade tensions, with strong analyst buy ratings on megacap tech stocks (AAPL, MSFT, META, NVDA). However, mixed views on Tesla highlight volatility in growth names. You should monitor tariff developments and Fed communications closely while favoring quality growth and defensive sectors as hedges.

Key recommendations include leveraging opportunities in the tech sector with validated upside potential from leading analysts, selectively rotating into defensive industrial and insurance sectors with positive analyst outlooks, and maintaining a cautious stance on tariff-sensitive companies.

The stock market returned to its winning ways on Wednesday as Nvidia and other technology stocks helped lift the Nasdaq Composite to another record close.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 218 points, or 0.5%. The S&amp;P 500 was up 0.6%. The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.9%. The Nasdaq topped its closing high from Friday, while the S&amp;P 500 moved just shy of its own record.
The yield on the 2-year Treasury note dropped to 3.86%, while the 10-year yield was down to 4.34%.
The rally in bonds, which sent yields lower, happened despite minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's June meeting, which showcased a divide among central bankers on when to start cutting interest rates.
Andrew Brenner, head of international fixed income at NatAlliance Securities, argues the latest moves in the bond market are all about positioning, especially given an auction of 10-year notes that saw strong demand.
Nvidia became the first U.S. firm to cross the $4 trillion market cap threshold this morning. It, along with a handful of other stocks linked to the artificial intelligence trade, helped boost the market.
The next major test won’t come until earnings season kicks off next week. And tech earnings will follow in the ensuing weeks after that. Given the market’s surge, any signs of weakness could jolt stocks.
But for now, volatility is back to its lowest levels since February. Not even the latest tariff threats could throw a wrench in that.",17,2,1752115613.0,2025-07-10T02:46:53+00:00,t3_1lw1tcr,stocks
234,NVDA,$POET -- THE 10 BAGGER YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT,"If you've been on WSB for any time at all, you've read a new DD and thought, ""This guy is a moron; his play will never work""—only to check the ticker a couple weeks later and see it's already up over 100%. This is your chance to right that wrong and make a shit ton of money in the process.

**SKIP THIS PART IF RETARDED:**

Thanks to NVDA and Co, computer chips are faster than ever. The problem? Electronic data transmission can't keep up. Because of thermodynamics, the fastest that data can effectively be electronically transmitted at the chip level is around 100Gbps-ish. In order to maximize the power of those NVDA chips companies pay millions for, they'll HAVE TO switch to photonics (data transmission using light). Okay, so who is making this technology? A lot of companies (Broadcom, Mitsubishi, Foxconn, Lumentum, etc). The tricky part is converting between electronic data from the chips and photonic data from the transmission modules. This is where POET Technologies comes in (here is their website, if you want to try to better understand what they do: [POET](https://www.poet-technologies.com/))

POET is incredibly well-positioned for the inevitable photonics boom. Their partners include Foxconn, Mitsubishi, Celestial AI, Luxshare, Adtran, Mentech, and Lessengers. POET will supply these companies with Optical Interposers that they will add to their Optical Modules. Those companies will sell those Optical Modules to AI data centers, cloud computing, telecom, etc. Diagram for the mentally impaired:

https://preview.redd.it/nxasurdroxbf1.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54fa88c56f66e8992752794c69041ccfc47ad597

Now, POET is a pre-revenue company. However, the switch from electronic to photonic chip-level data transmission is happening *as we speak*. And so, the single most important statement of this entire DD: **POET WILL START SHIPPING ORDERS TO THEIR CUSTOMERS AND MAKING SIGNIFICANT REVENUE WITHIN THE NEXT MONTHS, WEEKS, OR DAYS.** The reason why this hasn't already started is because the customers in the final step of the diagram need to wait 6-9 months to test-run the technology before finalizing their orders -- standard practice in the industry ([Source](https://agoracom.com/ir/POETTechnologies/forums/discussion/topics/809555-OFC-Summary/messages/2434913?entity=thread&amp;view=thread)). In other words, the orders have ALREADY BEEN PLACED, and everyone is simply waiting for the tests to conclude to actually start fulfilling them: ""In fact, \[Rep. from POET customer\] stated that they already have a large hyperscaler customer who has placed orders for the solution."" [(](https://agoracom.com/ir/POETTechnologies/forums/discussion/topics/809555-OFC-Summary/messages/2434913?entity=thread&amp;view=thread)[Source](https://agoracom.com/ir/POETTechnologies/forums/discussion/topics/809555-OFC-Summary/messages/2434913?entity=thread&amp;view=thread)).

With such a small market cap, a skeptic might wonder how POET would be able to defend their valuable position in the industry. First, they have a shit ton of patents for their technology ([Source](https://patents.justia.com/assignee/poet-technologies-inc)). Additionally, their various partners/customers have incorporated POET's technology into a wide variety of transmission speeds: 400Gbps, 800Gbps, 1.6Tbps, and even 3.2Tbps. Right now, 1.6T and 3.2T are not needed in the vast majority of cases. However, as companies require faster and faster data transmission in the coming years, they'll still be buying optical modules with POET's tech inside. Because of this, I cannot reiterate enough how well-positioned POET is to capitalize on the AI / data center boom.

**IF RETARDED, START READING HERE:**

Knowing that POET will start making money hand-over-fist in the near future, the next step is to calculate how much they could actually make. Taken from their Q4 2024 earnings report:

""Established a major wafer-level assembly and test facility for optical engines in Penang, Malaysia with the signing of several agreements with Globetronics Manufacturing Sdn. Bhd., a leading semiconductor manufacturer and contractor, equipping Globetronics with the capacity to manufacture an initial **1 million POET optical engines annually**."" ([Source](https://www.poet-technologies.com/news/poet-technologies-reports-fourth-quarter-2024-financial-results))

But that's not all. They recently made another manufacturing agreement for even more production, expected to be ready in 1 to 2 quarters:

""POET Technologies has signed a manufacturing agreement with NationGate Solutions in Malaysia to produce optical engine assemblies, enhancing its manufacturing capabilities and **addressing growing customer demand**."" ([Source](https://www.tipranks.com/news/company-announcements/poet-technologies-expands-manufacturing-with-nationgate-in-malaysia))

Because the Globetronics facility is already up and running ([Source](https://x.com/POETtech/status/1938241918712090821)), I'll be conservative and use the production numbers from that facility alone. Again, being conservative, I'll average the 400G and 800G optical units at $250 a pop. 1M units \* $250 / unit is $250M. Multiply that by a P/S ratio of 10, and you get a market cap of $2.5B -- representing a **5X** from the current market cap of $500M. And that revenue is going to start pouring in any day. But let's get crazy and estimate what this could be 3 years in the future. 3M units \* $500 / unit (accounting for 1.6T, 3.2T being more expensive) \* 10 P/S ratio = $15B market cap -- **30X upside** from current share price.

The best part about this situation? Wall Street doesn't care enough about pre-revenue microcaps to understand POET's potential. Once institutions take the time to understand POET's position in a rapidly burgeoning industry, this thing will practically double overnight (And yes, I know that it's already up over 50% from the recent lows. I posted this as soon as this got above the $500M mkt cap requirement).

https://preview.redd.it/gfcstni4cybf1.png?width=724&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a4e5793fb2e02108aa0b06dc6a1f7434d0c9df55

If this stock gets ANY sort of public attention, the market will quickly re-price its valuation. Coupled with the incoming slew of positive news (fulfilled purchase orders, revenue, new products, etc), this has the potential to go on a crazy run. The only caveat is that I can't tell you when exactly this could happen. POET's CEO has reiterated that H2 2025 will bring revenue -- I'd guess orders start getting announced before September. That doesn't mean you should go and buy calls expiring in a month, though.

https://preview.redd.it/n8yvi1vq6ybf1.png?width=1505&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7336f25c19e73565ad46e676de4dd2981ecbbc3

The easiest way to play this is to buy shares and chill -- I am almost certain that POET will at least double by the end of the year. If you happen to be a degenerate gambler and are morally against buying shares -- go for 1/16/26 or 1/15/27 10c. The options chain is stupidly bullish, and it could easily gamma squ\*eze if the share price continues to go up and degenerates continue buying OTM calls.

https://preview.redd.it/1c0jwnvt7ybf1.png?width=713&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a1f8fa4fe4b1f09fdb7837a6ccd1d25b5f4338c

My base case is $12/share by EOY, and $30/share by Q3 2026. My optimistic case is $30/share by EOY, and $45-60/share (3.75B to 5B mkt cap) by Q3 2026. We could easily see $60 or higher sooner than that if you get hype and news at the right time.

**TL;DR** \-- POET, a $500M mkt cap photonics company, is on the cusp of generating significant revenue. Think of the potential for an immediate 5X return, minimum. The market is largely unaware of this stock, and it will undergo a dramatic re-pricing in the coming weeks and months. Buy into the next multi-bagger BEFORE it happens.

**Position:**

EDIT: Initially forgot about this, but they've won a bunch of awards for their technology. Doesn't really mean much for share price, but it's evidence that this whole thing isn't vaporware.

150,NVDA,The worst stocks you bought based on bad advice,"Not being ashamed, I think few people here are professional financial or market analysts, and very few have key connections in the management of the companies they own shares in. We all invest based on our convictions and the public information we find online. So, of course, there will always be the know-it-alls criticizing our losses, saying everything could have been avoided if we were more rigorous...

Recently, I made three mistakes by buying stocks, thinking they would follow an upward trend due to the economic context, but it seems I always arrive too late because within 24 hours, I went from -10% to -24% currently (a small amount, but still...).

The first: Navitas Semiconductor. Several partnerships, the latest with Nvidia for its hyperscalers. I’m expecting a slight recovery while telling myself such a partnership will boost the stock a bit more. I bought at $7.90, putting in a decent amount. The stock is now hovering around $6, surviving with dead cat bounces. I’m sure if I hadn’t bought it, it would be at $10 now, like all the stocks that signed key partnerships with Nvidia...

The second: Genesis Mineral. I’ll keep it short: I was looking for a mining company to bet on the rise of gold. Someone recommended this company. It had reportedly acquired a highly promising new exploration site in Australia, a solid financial situation, an undervalued stock, and institutional investors as shareholders. I did my little research, and it seemed true. I took a small position, and in three weeks, I’ve lost 20%, and the stock is collapsing. The only news from the company is that they replaced an executive member, and that’s it... Technically, all resistances have been broken in three weeks, with the last one at $4, and it’s not impossible that it gets broken today... So, I see it crashing.

The third: Energy Fuels. I wanted to bet on rare earths and nuclear energy; some told me this was the best company. Well, spoiler: I’m down -8% in two days. The stock is completely tanking when the context should be boosting it. But no, the stock is diving even though I bought it at $5.90, knowing it had hit $6.38 the day before... now it’s at $5.50.

And then, one last little mistake: ITM Power PLC, a group specialized in green hydrogen, having secured several big contracts. No reason for it to drop. I took a small position after a 7% dip, but no luck,the stock has dropped -13% in two days...I think I’m done with Reddit advice because it’s ruining me more than anything else. I’m even going to stop this stock-picking momentum game because I always get burned. I dropped Credo Technology because the stock was sinking, breaking all resistances under rumors of being 'overvalued' and 'euphoric,' and the next day, it went up 8%, and today it’s hitting records. Or maybe on Reddit, people are trolling by recommending companies about to crash because you’re missing some piece of expertise",59,170,1752106441.0,2025-07-10T00:14:01+00:00,t3_1lvyov2,StockMarket

The chipmaker is the first company to ever achieve this market value.

Nvidia is the world’s most valuable company, surpassing Microsoft and Apple, both of which hit the $3 trillion mark before Nvidia. Microsoft is also one of Nvidia’s biggest and most important customers.

The California-based company, which was founded in 1993, first passed the $2 trillion mark in February 2024, and surpassed $3 trillion in June.

Nvidia has profited heavily off of growing demand for artificial intelligence hardware and chips since the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022. The company has positioned itself as the decisive leader in the creating the graphics processing units that power large language models.

426,NVDA,Energy efficiency and AI growth,"I'm new to investing and in that sub so apologies if my discussion is misplaced. I only own a few Nvidia stocks so far. Now that AI has grown leading many semiconductor and AI companies to grow. My thoughts are that energy efficiency for GPUs to run or other solutions will be the next big thing. With data centers popping everywhere energy demands seem to grow significantly. So I'm assuming that either companies with more energy efficient architectures will gain ground or other solutions will need to be brought up. I've done some research on that and I've seen that Ambarella is working on energy efficient chips, Intel is working on neuromorphic but still on r&amp;d level, IBM has some interesting work but it's not focused on that. My thoughts are that energy if not already will very soon be of the essence. So my question/discussion lies on how do you see the AI industry moving forward in relation to energy demands, and if that's to be the case what companies do you think would benefit from such direction.

Separately, Wall Street is growing concerned over the loss of EV tax credits and regulatory credits stemming from Trump's ""One Big Beautiful Bill.""

Over the weekend, Musk polled users on X about whether he should start an independent party called the America Party to challenge the government's status quo. Musk continued his complaints that Trump's bill would do nothing to rein in the deficit and offers little in terms of benefits to the American people.

""By a factor of 2 to 1, you want a new political party and you shall have it!"" Musk said. ""Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.""

146,NVDA,$30k in SPY 12/19 $680 Calls: BIG UPDATE - I've repositioned into 3/20/26 $780s,"For those of you who have been following for a few months, after a nearly 400% gain, I've repositioned all my 12/19 $680 calls into 3/20/26 $780 calls.

**The move:**

I’ve dubbed this trade The Big Call and rolled out of 243 SPY $680 calls (Dec 19, 2025, bought at $1.25 for $30,375 on Apr 25, 2025) into 2,289 SPY $780 calls (Mar 20, 2026) at $0.59 ($135,051 cost) due to major timeline shifts in my thesis. For those following this saga since April, here’s the play. I initially banked on Trump’s EU tariff resolution by Jul 4, 2025, and a 25 bps Fed rate cut by Jul 30, 2025, to push SPY to $680 by mid-August. But WSJ (Jun 26) and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent (on CBS’s Face the Nation, Jul 6, 2025) now confirm tariff talks with the EU, Japan, and South Korea are on track to wrap by Labor Day, Sep 1, 2025, with a rate cut likely on Sep 16–17, 2025 (Goldman Sachs projection). The $680 calls’ short expiration (Dec 2025, 94 days on Sep 17) risked heavy theta decay (-0.0462), so I pivoted to $780 calls with a longer runway (Mar 2026, 183 days on Sep 17, 79 days on Dec 31, theta -0.0071). The higher contract volume (2,289 vs. 243) supercharges returns for my bullish thesis: SPY hitting $720.40 by Dec 31, 2025 (+23.10% from $586.08, mirroring 2024’s Jan 1–Dec 31 gain).

**Market catalysts are electric:**

The Iran-Israel ceasefire (Jun 20–23) sparked a 2.9% SPY surge to $616.035 (Jun 27, blasting past the $611.09 high from Feb 19, 2025). Mag 7 Q2 2025 earnings, led by Nvidia’s relentless climb, are poised to smash consensus, fueling AI-driven market gains (per Bloomberg, Jul 3, 2025). Goldman Sachs projects three 25 bps rate cuts (Sep, Oct, Nov 2025), driven by cooling inflation (Core PCE 3.1%) and labor market softness (NFP +147,000, unemployment 4.1%, Reuters, Jul 1, 2025). Bessent’s optimism on tariff resolutions with Japan and South Korea (Times of India, Jul 7, 2025) signals a broader trade deal by Sep 1, boosting market confidence and SPY’s trajectory. 

Bull Case (Dec 31, 2025, SPY $720.40): The Big Call ($780 calls) hits $5.92, yielding $1,355,088 (2,289 × $5.92 × 100, +903.4%, +$1,220,037 from $135,051).

**Exit Plan:** 

I’m holding through Dec 31, 2025, to capture max upside at $720.40, riding the wave of trade deals, AI earnings, and rate cuts.",197,52,1751915377.0,2025-07-07T19:09:37+00:00,t3_1lu30pg,SmallStreetBets
428,NVDA,The majority of individual stocks often underperform the overall index.,"Some examples of stocks that have significantly outperformed the S&amp;P 500 over the past two decades (2005-2024 or similar 20-year periods) include:
NVIDIA, with an average annual return of 39.2%.
Netflix, with an average annual return of 36.5%.
Apple, with an average annual return of 32.0%.
Monster Beverage, with a total 20-year return of 15,439%.
Intuitive Surgical, with a total 20-year return of 13,889%. 

Survival Rate: Historically, only about 20-25% of companies in the S&amp;P 500 remain in the index after 20 years.

Finding these top-performing stocks is challenging, as the vast majority of individual securities do not outperform the broader market index over the long run. 

Final Takeaway
Over the 2005–2025 span, the S&amp;P 500 returned about 10% annually (total ~640%).
In contrast, real individual investors typically achieved 6–9% annualized returns, underperforming by 1–6 percentage points per year depending on timeframe.

147,NVDA,"BBAI: 3x, 6x, 10x Bagger (TAM analysis)","**Disclosure** – I own 107 shares of BBAI, one of the bigger positions in my highly speculative portfolio. TRIED TO POST ON WSB, they genuinely just next let any of my posts go through. Incredibly frustrating, anyways - posted this on BBAI too. Let me know your thoughts. 

So with all the hype around BBAI I thought it could be interesting to conduct some real fundamental analysis on the upside for BBAI. Instead of just blindly buying into the hype, I'm going to use CAGRs and TAMs to justify why BBAI can win big without having to suck up much of the market. Sick of all the copy/paste ChatGPT stock DD so let’s see if we can make a case using real analysis.

Ok so I bet half the regards who own the stock can't name its top four products, so here they are:

* **VeriScan**: Used for biometric identification and identity verification. Think airport boarding, border security, secure facilities.
* **TrueFace**: Facial recognition software with 1:N search capabilities, used in security and authentication settings.
* **ProModel &amp; Shipyard AI**: Modeling and simulation tools already used by DoD for logistics planning and military operations.
* **ConductorOS**: A distributed AI management tool for running models at the edge (on sensors, UAVs, battlefield equipment, etc.).

They’ve already got contracts with the Air Force, Army, DHS, and CBP. They’re now pushing into retail, fintech, and smart infrastructure.

# Why BigBear Can Actually Hit These Targets

* They already have government traction: They’re not starting from zero. BBAI is already working with the Air Force, Army, and DHS. VeriScan is being used in aviation/border control, TrueFace is deployed, and ProModel has history in DoD logistics.
* Post-Pangiam merger firepower: Their acquisition of Pangiam brings a strong commercial sales pipeline and partnerships (e.g., biometric payment deployment with SoftPoint, integration with Google Cloud). It’s not just gov anymore—they’re building a commercial machine.
* Their tech fits the fastest growing slices of AI: ConductorOS is aimed at edge AI (\~22% CAGR), and TrueFace is in facial recognition (\~16% CAGR). These aren’t sleepy legacy verticals—they’re accelerating.
* The market is massively fragmented: Most competitors own only 5–10% of the market, and 70–80% of each vertical remains uncaptured. BigBear doesn’t need to take market from giants—it just needs to grow where others aren’t.
* Federal-to-commercial crossover is rare: BigBear has both. Most gov-tech AI firms struggle to expand commercially. Most commercial AI firms can’t win federal bids. BigBear’s one of the few trying to do both with a unified platform.
* Their current revenue base is tiny: So even modest growth in share (0.1% → 0.5–1.5%) means massive % growth in revenue. It’s easier to go from $78M → $1B than from $5B → $10B.

Bottom line: Honestly - these could be conservative estimates given the DD. But I'm here trying to make a case that they don't need to win a huge % of the market so I'm gonna stick with my conservative estimates here.

# Valuation Scenarios Based on That Revenue

|Scenario|2030 Revenue|EV/Sales Multiple|Implied Enterprise Value|Implied Market Cap|Implied Share Price (155M shares)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Base|$1.08B|6×|$6.5B|\~$6.4B|\~$41|
|Bull|$1.08B|10×|$10.8B|\~$10.7B|\~$69|
|Bear|$1.08B|3×|$3.2B|\~$3.1B|\~$20|

Current price: $7.70. Current market cap: \~$2.26B

Even the base case is a near 2.8× return.

# How Did You Get the Share Price?

EV × Growth rate for each case, subtract debt (around \~$111M) and divide by shares. Maybe they take on more debt, maybe they pay it off, unclear I'm not a genie so I'm going to keep it static for the sake of analysis. They would have to really issue a lot of debt and new shares to dilute these implied share prices down to make them not super enticing.

# Risks

They have to win contracts to grow, who knows maybe they just never do. No such thing as a risk free bet. If you want that buy T-Bills.

There’s competition, maybe someone else wins out way bigger. Maybe??? But most of these other players are already pretty damn expensive, with huge market caps from other business lines. We are talking money made - BBAI seems to have the most upside from here.

Might need to issue more shares - dilute. Yeah no real good counter here, just could happen and take down the total return slightly.

If they don’t break into commercial use, growth slows, this space falls out of favor.

Any of this shit could happen to any of these companies. This is all just gambling take the bet you like.

# TL;DR

BBAI is a $2.26B market cap AI firm targeting $150B+ in combined TAMs across defense and commercial AI. With projected revenue of $1B+ by 2030, it doesn’t need to dominate—it just needs a piece. Even 0.5–1.5% share in each vertical gives you multi-billion-dollar upside.

BBAI doesn't need to come close to owning the market to win huge.",0,2,1751652876.0,2025-07-04T18:14:36+00:00,t3_1lrpj2m,SmallStreetBets
148,NVDA,IS THIS THE NEXT NVIDIA? HOLO,"Investors Keep an Eye on MicroCloud Hologram (HOLO) — IS THIS THE NEXT NVIDIA?

Published: July 3, 2025

Investors are showing growing interest in MicroCloud Hologram Inc., a company that is positioning itself as a leader in advanced holographic technologies, with disruptive potential similar to what Nvidia had in its early days.

What is MicroCloud Hologram?

MicroCloud Hologram combines cutting-edge artificial intelligence, spatial data science and optics technologies to create digital twins and quantum computing solutions. Its applications are mainly aimed at sectors such as electric vehicles and renewable energy.

Why so much interest now? • The company has maintained a technical consolidation pattern around $4.20, with a rounded base that suggests stability. • Trading volume has increased recently, which could anticipate a major breakout to the upside. • A volume surpassing of the zone between 5.20 and 5.50USD would be a clear sign of a change in trend towards the rise. • Furthermore, the alliances and contracts that MicroCloud is closing with large companies in the energy and automotive sectors generate positive expectations in the markets.

Risks to consider

Like any small company (nano-cap), MicroCloud Hologram faces significant risks due to its high volatility and the uncertainty typical of technology companies in the growth phase. Current losses and lack of consolidated profits are also factors that investors should analyze carefully.

Conclusion

The current moment for MicroCloud Hologram seems critical: the technical structure and the increase in volume invite us to think about a possible change in trend. If the stock strongly breaks the key resistance of $5.20–$5.50, it could trigger a major bullish rally.",0,15,1751630671.0,2025-07-04T12:04:31+00:00,t3_1lrh2o7,SmallStreetBets

151,NVDA,"Comprehensive Market Research on Market Impact from the ""Big Beautiful Bill"" - Claude Opus 4","# Market turmoil and opportunity: Inside the $3.3 trillion tax revolution

The One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act has cleared its final legislative hurdle, passing the Senate 51-50 on July 1, 2025, with Vice President Vance casting the deciding vote. This sweeping $3.3 trillion tax and spending package now returns to the House for final passage before the July 4 deadline, creating immediate and dramatic shifts across equity markets. The legislation fundamentally reshapes the American tax landscape while triggering violent sector rotations that demand immediate portfolio repositioning.

## R&amp;D renaissance drives tech sector opportunities

The restoration of immediate R&amp;D expense deductibility represents the most significant corporate tax change since 2017, reversing the painful 5-year amortization requirement imposed in 2022. **Technology giants spending $45-65 billion annually on R&amp;D will see immediate cash flow benefits**, with the Senate's permanent restoration creating more value than the House's temporary version.

**NVIDIA (NVDA)** emerges as a primary beneficiary despite stretched valuations. The company's massive GPU development costs become immediately deductible, improving cash flows at a critical moment in the AI infrastructure buildout. While the stock hit all-time highs in 2025 with a recent 4.33% gain, the R&amp;D provision provides fundamental support for continued momentum.

Among mega-cap tech, **Meta Platforms (META)** offers the most compelling risk-reward profile. The company allocates **34% of gross profit to R&amp;D ($39.1 billion annually)**, positioning it to capture outsized benefits from immediate deductibility. Unlike peers trading at extreme premiums, Meta's valuation remains reasonable relative to its AI and metaverse growth potential.

**Alphabet (GOOGL)** presents an underappreciated opportunity with $45.9 billion in annual R&amp;D spending, second only to Amazon. The company's diversified revenue streams across search, cloud, and autonomous driving provide defensive characteristics while the R&amp;D provision enhances offensive growth investments. Waymo's robotaxi development particularly benefits from immediate expense recognition.

Biotech offers selective opportunities, with **Gilead Sciences (GILD)** standing out after a 26% gain over the past year. The company's HIV drug lenacapavir faces a critical FDA approval timeline in June 2025, with immediate R&amp;D deductibility improving the economics of its robust pipeline development.

## Healthcare transformation through HSA expansion

The bill's healthcare provisions create a watershed moment for health insurers and HSA administrators. **Contribution limits double for lower-income earners**, while Medicare Part A enrollment no longer disqualifies participation – a change affecting millions of working seniors. The expansion of eligible expenses to include gym memberships and direct primary care arrangements fundamentally alters the HSA value proposition.

**UnitedHealth Group (UNH)** leads sector beneficiaries with a compelling setup: trading at just 11.06x earnings with analyst price targets implying 20% upside to $524.70. The recent Medicare Advantage rate increase of 5.06% (versus 2.23% originally proposed) adds $25 billion in industry revenue, with UNH capturing the largest share. The stock gained 6% on the Medicare announcement alone, signaling further upside as HSA expansion details emerge.

**CVS Health (CVS)** offers unique dual exposure as both a major health insurer and HSA administrator through its vast retail footprint. The stock surged 6.5% on Medicare rate news and maintains a Strong Buy rating from analysts who see the integrated model capturing outsized benefits from expanded HSA eligibility and usage.

## Homebuilders at historic discounts

The preservation and enhancement of mortgage interest deductions, combined with the new $10,000 auto loan interest deduction for American-made vehicles, creates powerful tailwinds for homebuilders trading at seemingly impossible valuations. **D.R. Horton (DHI)** trades at just 4.6-12.97x earnings (sources vary due to calculation methods), focusing on affordable homes averaging $375,000 – perfectly positioned for millennial first-time buyers benefiting from enhanced tax breaks.

**PulteGroup (PHM)** at 4.4x earnings represents even deeper value, with management's strategic focus on entry-level buyers and aggressive land acquisition positioning the company for multi-year outperformance. These valuations suggest the market completely dismisses the housing shortage reality and underestimates the demand surge from improved affordability through tax benefits.

For exposure to the luxury segment, **Toll Brothers (TOL)** offers unique positioning with average sales prices near $1 million. While more interest-rate sensitive, the enhanced SALT deduction cap of $40,000 particularly benefits their high-tax state customers in the Northeast and California.

## Clean energy faces existential crisis

The bill's clean energy provisions represent nothing short of an industry earthquake. The **60-day construction deadline** for projects to qualify for clean electricity credits effectively kills most utility-scale developments not already underway. Projects must be operational by December 31, 2028, creating an impossible timeline for new initiatives.

**First Solar (FSLR)** has plummeted from $300 to ~$127, with analyst downgrades cascading as federal tax credit dependency becomes a liability rather than an asset. The company's U.S.-based manufacturing provides some insulation versus Chinese imports, but the credit elimination fundamentally breaks the economics of solar deployment.

The residential solar sector faces complete disruption. **Sunrun (RUN)** at ~$6 (down from $26) and **SunPower (SPWR)** at ~$3 epitomize the devastation, with business models entirely dependent on federal subsidies now facing extinction. Leasing models particularly suffer as the economics collapse without transferable tax credits.

Electric vehicle manufacturers confront similar challenges. The $7,500 new EV credit terminates after 2025, while used EV credits end within 90 days of enactment. **Tesla (TSLA)** trades at 97x forward earnings – a valuation impossible to justify as mass-market EV adoption stalls without subsidies. **Rivian (RIVN)** burns $800 million to $1 billion quarterly, creating an existential funding crisis as the pathway to profitability evaporates.

EV charging infrastructure stocks reflect terminal decline scenarios. **ChargePoint (CHPT)** down 74% year-to-date faces going concern warnings, while **EVgo (EVGO)** and **Blink Charging (BLNK)** trade at fractions of their former valuations. The sector requires massive government support to achieve profitability – support that definitively ends with this legislation.

## Inflation hedging becomes imperative

The bill's $3.3 trillion price tag, expanding to $5 trillion if temporary provisions extend, creates unavoidable inflationary pressures. Treasury Secretary Bessent's claims of non-inflationary growth appear politically motivated, with independent analysts projecting 2-3% additional inflation from fiscal expansion alone.

Gold has already responded, reaching $3,344/oz on July 2, 2025, up 26.7% year-to-date. **iShares Gold Trust (IAU)** offers the most cost-efficient exposure with a 0.25% expense ratio versus 0.4% for GLD. Goldman Sachs' conservative $2,700 target appears outdated, with consensus projections of $3,560-$3,925 for 2025 and $3,904-$5,155 for 2026 reflecting the fiscal reality.

TIPS bonds offer compelling real yields not seen in years: 5-year at 1.65%, 10-year at 1.99%, and 30-year at 2.57%. Building a TIPS ladder particularly suits conservative investors seeking inflation protection without equity volatility. **Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities (VTIP)** provides liquid exposure for tactical positioning.

Commodities historically outperform during inflationary regimes, with **Invesco DB Commodity Index (DBC)** offering diversified exposure across energy (55%), agriculture, and metals. The fund's 1.36% year-to-date gain understates potential upside as fiscal stimulus drives demand-pull inflation.

Among equities, consumer staples with genuine pricing power outperform. **Coca-Cola (KO)** up 20% year-to-date demonstrates this dynamic, with its 3% dividend yield and consistent 4%+ price increases staying ahead of inflation. **Procter &amp; Gamble (PG)** matches this performance with six consecutive years of 4%+ organic growth, proving durable pricing power across essential categories.

## Current market dynamics and positioning

The S&amp;P 500's recovery from April lows – gaining 24% to trade within 2% of all-time highs – masks violent sector rotations beneath the surface. Clean energy ETFs like **iShares Global Clean Energy (ICLN)** face continuous outflows, down 11.22% over one year, while defense and traditional energy attract record inflows.

Institutional positioning reveals the smart money's migration. Hedge funds maintain record-low leverage at 25-year lows while holding elevated cash positions earning ~5% yields. Their largest overweight remains healthcare at +662 basis points versus the Russell 3000, anticipating further benefits from HSA expansion and Medicare Advantage rate increases.

Volume spikes tell the story of dislocation. Some affected stocks like **PubMatic (PUBM)** saw trading volumes 70x normal levels around bill announcements, indicating forced liquidations and dramatic repositioning. The VIX remains elevated as uncertainty persists regarding House passage and implementation details.

## Ethical investment opportunities avoiding oil and defense

For investors seeking bill benefits while maintaining ESG principles, compelling opportunities exist outside oil/gas and defense sectors. Healthcare innovation leaders like **Centene Corporation (CNC)** with its 0.99/1.00 ESG Pulse score combine strong social impact with direct bill benefits through tax cuts enabling expanded community health programs.

Technology ESG leaders particularly shine. **NVIDIA** maintains an MSCI AAA rating while benefiting from R&amp;D credits. **Salesforce (CRM)** achieved net-zero emissions across all scopes while gaining from corporate tax provisions. **Keysight Technologies (KEYS)** offers the sector's lowest ESG risk score at 6.07 while capturing R&amp;D benefits for sustainable technology development.

The manufacturing renaissance creates opportunities in companies like **Applied Materials (AMAT)**, upgraded to MSCI AAA rating with over 100 ESG specialists on staff. The company benefits significantly from bonus depreciation and R&amp;D credits while maintaining net-zero commitments and sustainable manufacturing practices.

Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) offer fixed-income alternatives with social impact. Organizations like Local Initiatives Support Corporation and Reinvestment Fund carry investment-grade ratings while channeling tax savings into underserved communities. The enhanced Opportunity Zone provisions through 2028 create additional tax-advantaged impact investing opportunities.

## Strategic portfolio positioning for the new regime

The One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act demands immediate portfolio action across three critical dimensions: capturing direct beneficiaries, avoiding terminal declines, and hedging inevitable inflation. The window for positioning narrows daily as the House approaches its final vote.

**Highest conviction long positions**: UnitedHealth Group (UNH) for healthcare transformation, Gilead Sciences (GILD) for biotech R&amp;D benefits, D.R. Horton (DHI) for housing affordability enhancement, and iShares Gold Trust (IAU) for inflation protection. These positions offer asymmetric risk-reward with multiple catalysts for outperformance.

**Mandatory avoidance list**: Sunrun (RUN), ChargePoint (CHPT), Enphase Energy (ENPH), and other clean energy pure plays face business model extinction. Even at depressed valuations, these remain value traps without federal support. EV manufacturers including Tesla at 97x earnings cannot justify valuations without subsidies.

**Inflation hedging allocation**: Conservative investors should allocate 15-20% to gold, 10-15% to TIPS, and 15-20% to consumer staples. Growth-oriented portfolios can reduce these allocations but ignore inflation hedging at their peril given the fiscal expansion's magnitude.

The bill's passage creates the most significant tax regime change since 2017, with impacts reverberating for decades. Unlike typical tax legislation with gradual effects, the immediate termination of clean energy credits and instant restoration of R&amp;D deductibility create violent discontinuities requiring immediate action. Winners and losers have rarely been clearer – the only question remaining is execution speed as these dramatic shifts unfold.",1,0,1751469478.0,2025-07-02T15:17:58+00:00,t3_1lpyjs7,SmallStreetBets
129,NVDA,You Don't Need to Buy More,"The ‘elephant in the room’ for Palantir Technologies is its expected P/E of over 200x and market cap of over 100x sales, reflecting expectations of accelerated growth. Is the market forecast correct?

Palantir's unique position at the AI application layer, proven scalability, and fit with Western values justify its high valuation by making it a potential $1 trillion company.

Using Microsoft as a benchmark, Palantir would need $90bn in revenue, $68bn in gross profit, $23bn in free cash flow and a 40.3% compound annual growth rate in revenue to become a $1 trillion company.

Palantir's first quarter 2025 revenue growth rate of 39% is in line with the required 40.3% CAGR, and the US commercial revenue growth rate (71% year-over-year) suggests a potential acceleration to 70% by 2026.

Volatility is to be expected, and those who are sceptical about AI should avoid PLTR stocks. I have been following Palantir Technologies Inc since May 2024 and recommend it as a strong buy given its unique positioning in AI (personal view)

Palantir has a unique competitive advantage in the ‘application layer’ of AI, i.e. in the systems That is, in the user-facing part of the system, AI functionality can be accessed and used through specific applications.

Palantir has proven that its solutions can deliver real value to business customers and governments. More importantly, it has demonstrated the scalability of its business - as evidenced by its impressive Rule of 40 numbers.

Being a founder-led company with a nearly two-decade history in the U.S. military and government sectors is another competitive advantage for Palantir. The company has positioned itself politically as a strong supporter of Western values and an important military supplier in the age of AI.

Given these factors, Palantir is uniquely positioned to benefit from the acceleration of the AI race as AI applications (and their growth) shift from GPU vendors to agent-based AI and robotics. In short, Palantir is one of the few, if not the only, company that can play a central role in global workforce automation.

Recently, with Palantir's recent record highs, I wanted to focus on something else that is like an ‘elephant in the room’ for anyone considering taking a stake in Palantir: its high valuation.

What does the market see that you don't?

When I started covering Palantir, critics pointed to the company's inability to scale its business (Palantir was glorified as a ‘consulting firm’) and its questionable addressable market in AI (which some still see as a passing fad or bubble).

Today, those who are bearish on Palantir tend to acknowledge that the company is truly unique, but the criticism focuses on its valuation. To be clear, I fully understand those who are concerned when they see its expected P/E ratio exceeding 200x and its market cap exceeding 100x sales.Palantir's valuation is indeed high.

However, when I evaluate a stock, I always ask myself the same question: what does the market think about a company to give it such a high valuation?

I think the market is accelerating, fuelled by the AI race. A fundamental question investors should ask themselves is: Does Palantir have what it takes to be a $1 trillion company?

If the answer is yes, then the upside is about 3x relative to today's valuation.

To me, it's clear that the market believes this is a new Mag 7 company on the rise, and that's why it's giving PLTR such a high valuation, regardless of its accelerating growth.

In the next section, I will analyse what it will take for Palantir to grow into a $1 trillion market cap company. Feel free to judge for yourself whether this is realistic. If it is realistic, then I think long-term investors should be able to accept Palantir's current high valuation, which still represents a significant discount relative to the company's long-term trajectory.

What would a $1 trillion Palantir look like?

Not all companies with a $1 trillion market cap trade at the same valuation. In order to figure out what a $1 trillion market cap Palantir would actually look like, I would first find a reference company to compare it to. That's not easy because there are only about a dozen companies with a market cap of more than $1 trillion globally, and some of them are in completely different sectors, such as energy.

My company of choice is Microsoft. I think it is the closest to Palantir in terms of business, as most of its business is geared towards B2B customers and selling software solutions to them. Its business model is also partially similar to Palantir's in that it ‘locks in’ enterprise customers with hard-to-migrate software such as Microsoft Windows or Microsoft Office. Finally, Microsoft itself is a strong AI company with a high (albeit more reasonable) valuation. Is this likely to happen? My take on the AI race

Palantir's 39% year-over-year growth rate through the first quarter of 2025 is roughly in line with my assumptions for the above scenario, which could value the company at $1 trillion. Of course, I don't expect Palantir to really maintain a perfect 40%-ish growth rate for 10 years and then suddenly drop to 5%. I expect Palantir to accelerate its growth over the next few quarters and then eventually slow down.

In this context, it's worth noting that Palantir's overall revenue growth has historically lagged U.S. commercial revenue. For example, in the first quarter of 2024, U.S. commercial revenues grew 40% year-over-year, while total revenues grew 21%. One year later (Q1 2025), total revenues are roughly at the same level as commercial revenues a year ago (39% vs. 40%), while U.S. commercial revenues are now growing at 71% year-over-year.

I think the market has taken note of this trend and now expects Palantir's total revenue growth rate to accelerate from 40% to roughly 70% (on par with U.S. commercial revenues) by the beginning of 2026.Palantir may achieve this by the first quarter of 2026, later in 2026, or not at all. Market volatility is to be expected. Obviously, I expect the market to react differently in each case - in my view, adjustments will only be made if the growth rate does not match the expected acceleration.

Palantir's success in becoming a trillion-dollar company will ultimately depend on whether the AI race provides Palantir with enough potential markets to accelerate its growth.

A detailed discussion of the entire AI race is beyond the scope of this article. In short, I am personally very bullish on AI and I think we are at the beginning of a new industrial revolution. I believe that over the next few quarters we will see continued demand for GPUs and microchips translate into accelerated demand for cloud solutions and AI application layer solutions, which will benefit Palantir greatly.NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA), a leading manufacturer of ‘key components’ (GPUs) in the AI race, was one of the early beneficiaries of AI. The company has managed to grow its total revenue from just over $5bn in 2016 to $148bn. This equates to a staggering 46% compound annual growth rate over nine years, which is roughly in line with my model of how Palantir will grow to a $1 trillion valuation.

Personally, I think Palantir can replicate Nvidia's success over the next 10 years as the AI race rapidly shifts from hardware to new software applications.

That's why I don't think Palantir is currently overvalued. The market is simply more forward-looking than it has been in the past. Instead, I see \~3x upside from its current valuation, and I maintain my medium-term price target of $250 per share (consistent with my past research), which is based on its five-year CAGR of \~30% and an investment horizon of 2030. To be clear, I do believe that Palantir will eventually be valued at $1 trillion, and I expect to reassess my price target in the future. Needless to say, those readers who remain sceptical about AI and believe it is a bubble destined to burst would do well to steer clear of Palantir and, as I stated in the previous section, the bullish case for Palantir at its current price is only valid if the AI race accelerates. That is the fundamental risk of entering Palantir at this time.

Another key risk is volatility. With the market's current growth expectations for the company so high, its shares are likely to pull back sharply on even the slightest sign of weakness. In my view, Palantir is not only on track to meet its earnings guidance in the coming quarters, but it is also expected to consistently beat guidance and begin to show accelerated growth - possibly in line with its U.S. commercial sector's growth rate (70%) in the first quarter.

Even if the company eventually evolves into a new ‘Mag 7’ giant, adjustments and volatility are likely. No company is immune to poor results, and investors should be wary of Palantir's potential exposure to rapid changes in market sentiment in the future. In my opinion, anyone not comfortable with high volatility should avoid this stock.

Conclusion

At first glance, Palantir's valuation seems unsustainable. However, the market is always forward looking and if all it took to be a good investor was to read the P/E ratio, then we could all be Warren Buffett. The key question investors should be thinking about when analysing Palantir is: what is the market seeing beyond the numbers of the last few quarters?

Personally, I think the market is witnessing a company with a $1 trillion valuation. Overall revenue growth in the first quarter of 2025 (39%) is comparable to the growth in U.S. commercial sales a year ago (40% in the first quarter of 2024). I believe the market now expects this trend to continue, with Palantir growing at 70% of the level of U.S. commercial revenues in the first quarter of 2025.

Moving towards $1 trillion is achievable in my view. palantir needs to grow at a CAGR of about 40% over the next 10 years, slightly less than NVIDIA's 2016 year-to-date growth rate. In my view, Palantir is uniquely positioned in the AI ‘application layer’ and I believe it can achieve this goal.

A $1 trillion valuation implies about 3x upside from current price levels. Therefore, net of short-term volatility, I believe Palantir remains undervalued. While I maintain my five-year price target of $250 per share, if the company continues to perform as well as it has in the past, I expect to buy on the downside

130,NVDA,OpenAI says no plans to use Google's self-developed chips,"Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)-backed OpenAI has no active plans to use Alphabet unit Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) tensor processing units, or TPUs, the company said following media reports that the AI startup was planning to use rival Google's chips to meet growing demand, Reuters reported.

A spokesperson for OpenAI told the news agency that OpenAI is in early testing with some of Google's TPUs, but it has no plans to deploy them at scale right now, the report added.

OpenAI is actively using Nvidia's graphics processing units, or GPUs, and AMD's (NASDAQ:AMD) AI chips to power its growing demand, the report noted.

A potential deal for Google's TPUs could have marked a supplier diversification for OpenAI, which has relied on Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) chips in the past to train its AI models and for inference computing. On Monday, analysts from Morgan Stanley said in a research note that potential usage of Google's chips for inferencing OpenAI's AI workloads would have been a significant endorsement of Google's hardware.

Over the weekend, it was reported that OpenAI has started using Google-made AI chips to build its products. However, it was noted that Google was not providing the most powerful TPUs to OpenAI, signaling its plans to use its most advanced versions to power the company's internal projects, including its own large language model Gemini.

Last month, OpenAI, reportedly, signed a deal with Google Cloud for the AI company's computing needs.",84,22,1751415563.0,2025-07-02T00:19:23+00:00,t3_1lphw97,stocks

131,NVDA,"As a long term investor, how to strategize my exit plan (when to sell)?","I know when a company is at a bargain to buy. Problem is, I know when to buy, but I don’t know when to sell. Do I sell when I need the money or when doctor tells me I only got a month to live? 

Let me give you several examples:

I was able to buy lots of Celsius stocks at $8 basis in 2020 when I began trying their drinks, enjoyed it and began seeing Celsius drinks sold everywhere at grocery markets and convenience stores. I felt confident. Celsius rose all the way to $95, the stock split and dropped all the way back to $25. Obviously, I did not sell any.

Same thing applies to FSLY, SQ, SE when I did not sell at the peak and watched them drop all the way back to my entry price then I panic sold and only secured a very little gain.

SMCI - I also panic sold at $23.81 for small gain and obviously, watching the price going back up is lots of pain. 

I was able to buy lots of crowdstrike last year in July when the outage caused chaos within airport and various companies. I also scooped some UNH as well due to recent (to me, it’s overreaction) free fall. 

I bought lots of ASTS at $11 and sold at $30 to get my entry money back. Then it went all the way to $46. 

Lots of people say, if a stock gives you 25% to 50%, it makes sense for you to sell all, take the profit and run. It’s not true at all. If you sold NVDA, TSLA, AMD and PLTR at 30% gain, you probably cried yourself to sleep every night. Some of the companies do have ten-fold potential if you decide to hold long. And selling them also subject yourself to short term capital gain tax. 

Also, PLTR PE ratio skyrockets. I understand military contract and AI reliance are legit, but there’s no guarantee for price to hold. When is a good time to sell? Which companies have bright future to hold strong despite free fall? Nobody has a crystal ball I understand but does reading business financial statement and learning their fundamental/ business model/ ecological system gives you a clue? 

Market is at ATH carried by major techs due to AI replacing humans leading to boost in company’s profit margin and future earning potential. But correction will eventually come.

154,NVDA,Daily Newsletter from an app I created (not an ad),"Hey guys, 

I'll be sharing a newsletter from a flow I created daily for free if anyone wants to read it; it compiles information from various sources (news, newsletters, reddit, twitter etc, creates some underlying reports etc). It's just a project of mine which I'm not planning to commercialize and simply want to see if there is any feedback :)

The answer is theoretically customized to cater to a high risk, knowledgable investor.
  

Alright, let's cut to the chase. Here's the lay of the land for today, June 30, 2025. The market is running a two-speed playbook, and if you're not on the right side of it, you're getting left behind.

\### Today's Market Briefing: The Great Divergence Accelerates

Bottom Line Up Front: The market is a tale of two cities. 🏙️ On one street, AI and tech are throwing a block party, fueled by massive deals and relentless momentum. On the other, the macro storm clouds are gathering, with giants like BlackRock sounding the alarm. Our AI Signal's ""Great Divergence"" theme isn't just a forecast; it's happening in real-time today. The play is to ride the tech wave while keeping a close eye on the macro cracks.

\---

\### 📈 What's Driving the Action Today

The news flow is perfectly illustrating this split personality. Here's what's moving the needle right now:

\#### 1. The AI Engine Roars Louder 🚀

The AI momentum is not slowing down; it's finding new ways to accelerate.

Palantir (PLTR) &amp; Accenture (ACN) Team Up: Palantir shares jumped \~5% today on a major strategic partnership with Accenture Federal Services. According to the announcement, Accenture's massive Data &amp; AI team will train on Palantir's platform to supercharge government deployments. This is a critical development, moving beyond hype to real-world, large-scale enterprise adoption. It's a textbook example of the AI application layer creating value.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/palantir-stock-jumps-accenture-federal-163425936.html

Semiconductor Strength Continues: While the news is from late last week, the sentiment is carrying over. Nvidia (NVDA) continues to flirt with a $4 trillion market cap (https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-breakout-puts-4-trillion-100304547.html), and Micron's (MU) stellar earnings, driven by AI data center demand, are lifting the entire memory sector. The foundation of the AI trade remains rock-solid.

\#### 2. Fintech Disrupts TradFi 🔗

The lines between traditional finance and crypto are blurring, creating explosive opportunities.

Robinhood (HOOD) Goes Global: Robinhood is surging today after launching tokenized trading for over 200 U.S. stocks and ETFs for its European users. As detailed in the news from [Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/robinhood-launches-tokens-allowing-eu-users-to-trade-in-us-stocks-4117441), this move, in partnership with Arbitrum, allows 24/7, commission-free trading. This is a direct shot across the bow of traditional exchanges and a massive validation for blockchain-based capital markets. HOOD is trending heavily on social media, and for good reason.

\#### 3. Big Pharma on the Hunt 💊

The Healthcare sector is proving its ""new defensive"" status with aggressive M&amp;A.

AbbVie (ABBV) Buys Capstan: AbbVie announced it's acquiring cell therapy developer Capstan Therapeutics for up to $2.1 billion. This is a strategic move to bolster its immunology pipeline as its blockbuster drug, Humira, faces patent cliffs. This shows that cash-rich pharma giants are actively buying innovation, creating value and putting a floor under the sector.

\---

\### 💣 The Macro Headwinds Are Building

While the tech party rages, don't ignore the warning sirens. The macro picture is getting darker, and the institutional players are taking notice.

BlackRock Sounds the Alarm on US Debt: In a high-importance report today, BlackRock (BLK) explicitly stated that surging U.S. government debt is the ""greatest risk to US market standing."" They warn that the debt could sap appetite for U.S. assets and are advising clients to diversify. When the world's largest asset manager issues a warning this stark, you listen. This is the institutional validation of the fears we've been tracking.

Source: Rising government debt poses greatest risk to US market standing, says BlackRock (https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/abbvie-to-buy-capstan-therapeutics-for-up-to-21-billion-4116986)

Fed &amp; Political Pressure Cooker: The fallout from Fed Chair Powell's testimony last week continues to simmer. The Fed is walking a tightrope, trying to be ""data-dependent"" while facing immense political pressure to cut rates. This uncertainty is a key source of volatility. The Fed's move to ease capital requirements for big banks, as reported by CNBC, shows they are trying to keep the financial plumbing working, but the underlying stress is evident.

Retail Jitters: On the social media front, there's a tangible sense of unease. Reddit discussions point to a ""strange calm"" (https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5375991-gop-tax-bill-health-cuts/) and investor complacency, while also highlighting risks from the GOP tax bill, a weak housing market, and the looming July 9 tariff deadline.

In short, the market is giving us a clear signal: The momentum is with AI-centric tech and innovative healthcare. The risk is in the broad economy and cyclical sectors exposed to policy blunders and a weakening consumer. Trade accordingly.",1,1,1751303331.0,2025-06-30T17:08:51+00:00,t3_1lod42v,SmallStreetBets
354,NVDA,IREN Play and why it has more room to run,"To get bullish with IREN, all one has to do is take a view on monetization of energy &amp; land portfolio. Time to power is one of the most important pieces of the story. If the hyperscalars have 3 years to get to GW scale they can build their own energy. Oracle searching for 5 1GW+ sites ready in early 2026 - who else has this? CBRE new update yesterday shows data center rents are very strong

Mining Business
~650M, 550M, 450M, 300M 
If bitcoin does well or network difficulty stays constrained this can be much higher. If AI takes as much energy as people estimate, mining will only be done in markets with extreme power oversupply

Cumulative cash flows = 2B ($9 per share undiscounted) though all of this will be reinvested 

Horizon 1 &amp; 2 
125M EBITDA ($1.25M/MW) -

IREN has 47MW with redundancy, great latency in Canada ready for conversion. If someone is willing to sign 2-4 year leases they will get GPU financing. 

Assume they do convert it, 1B of financing, lease for $3/hr (cheap, CRWV rents for $8.5) over whole 3-year chip life, 90% utilization (much higher now) - 3-4% of rev energy cost = 190M EBT * 10 = 1.9B value ($8.5/shr)

If some of these were used for cloud, value creation would be higher, so no use distinguishing 

Horizon illustrates the value capture clearly, costs 350M yet will deliver 60M-75M EBITDA valued at 15-20x, or 900M-1.5B, thus captures 7.3M-20M/MW in value. Even at 750k/MW on 1.92M/MW data center revenue ($160/kw/mo 2024 avg. rent, Cushman &amp; Wakefield) you get valued at 15M/MW on a 7M cost, creating 8M/MW of value. At extremely low multiple for data center of 15 x 750k/MW = 11.25M/MW, capturing 4.25M/MW or 16B across the portfolio = $70/shr

What initially gave me conviction - comparing 3.5 cents / kwh vs 6 cents for natural gas, &gt;10 cents for nuclear, saves 220-570k/MW/yr. Capitalizing that along with other costs at 15x gives 3.3M-8.5M/MW value from energy savings alone. Then potentially couple M/MW from time savings, latency advantage, land value, power infrastructure, grid connected secured energy

This is cruder, but the point stands even if my assumptions are way off

$CORZ potentially acquired by $CRWV  

1.3GW secured power, 500MW AI DC under construction with CRWV lease worth 7.5B (15M/MW) minus lease financing of 5B = 2.5B value

CORZ EV ex AI DC = 3.5B
CORZ EV ex BTC &amp; AI = 2.9B
Implied value per secured MW = $3.625M/MW 

IREN has 3GW secured, though only 150MW AI under construction, worth maybe 1.875B (12M/MW, 20% less than $CORZ) minus remaining funding req of 125M = 1.75B 

IREN EV = 3.75B 
IREN mining = 51 EH (650M EBITDA * 3x) = 1.95B
IREN EV ex AI DC = 2B

Data Centers in 2025:
Bloom Energy 2025 Datacenter Report: Mid-Year Pulse

 Executive Context: Power Is Now the Bottleneck

AI’s exponential growth is colliding with a fundamental constraint: electricity. 
.By 2028, U.S. data centers are expected to consume 12% of the nation’s electricity—up from just 4% in 2023.
.Some hyperscale campuses are projected to demand over 1 GW, equivalent to powering 800,000 homes.
.This new reality is shifting power availability from a ""consideration"" to a strategic constraint that can determine the success or failure of a data center buildout.

1. Power Access Has Surpassed All Other Site Criteria
.84% of developers now rank power availability among their top three considerations, far surpassing fiber proximity, regulations, and labor access.
.A year ago, fiber was the top concern—this shift underscores how pressing the power situation has become.

2. Power Delays Are Widely Underestimated
.Data center developers are underestimating grid connection timelines by 1–2 years.
.For example, in high-demand markets like Northern Virginia and Phoenix, developers think they can get power by 2026–2027, while utilities are forecasting 2028 or later.
.This gap reveals a growing disconnect and puts urgency on alternative solutions like onsite generation.

3. AI Adoption Is Driving a Massive Scale-Up in Power Needs
.The median AI data center size is projected to grow:
.From ~175 MW today
.To ~275 MW by 2030
.To ~375 MW by 2035
.Much of this growth is tied to high-power chips like NVIDIA Blackwell (~1kW per GPU).
.Many facilities will also merge training and inference workloads, further compounding the energy demand.
.There's also a significant shift to DC (direct current) architectures, borrowed from EV battery systems, to better manage the power flow for water-cooled racks and high-density servers.

4. Onsite Power Is the Next Frontier
.Use of onsite power generation is expected to triple by 2030:
.38% of facilities will incorporate onsite generation (vs. 13% a year ago).
.27% expect to be fully powered onsite by 2030 (up from just 1%).

Reasons include:
.Faster deployment (vs. waiting on grid expansion)
.Control over reliability
.Load flexibility for AI workloads
.However, air permitting could become a key hurdle—especially in “non-attainment zones” with strict emissions rules. This is why low-emission fuel cell tech (like Bloom’s) is gaining favor.

 5. Reliability, Cost, and Load Flexibility Rule
.Reliability is the #1 requirement—non-negotiable.
.Cost matters, but only when paired with acceleration in time-to-power.
.Load following is now essential: AI models generate highly variable power demands, and older tech like turbines may not respond fast enough without compromising performance or emissions.
.Despite the focus on speed and cost, 95% of respondents still have carbon reduction goals, even if they’re deprioritized in the short term.

- Strategic Takeaway: Onsite Power as a Competitive Lever
.Onsite generation is no longer a Plan B—it’s a strategic enabler.
.The winners in this space will:
.Build faster by avoiding grid bottlenecks
.Maintain uptime with reliable onsite solutions
.Use scalable, flexible, and clean technologies (fuel cells, etc.)
.Plan around permitting risks with low-emissions tech

132,NVDA,The NVDA journey has just begun,"Nvidia is at the centre of the AI revolution, with breakthrough products and great opportunities ahead that continue to exceed my expectations.

Recent innovations such as the Blackwell GB200 NVL72 and expanding AI applications, including robotics, solidify Nvidia's dominant market position and growth potential.

Despite a record valuation, Nvidia's history of growing profits at a rate above valuation is unlikely to end.

I remain a committed long-term buyer of NVDA and I believe that Nvidia's leadership in AI and data centre technology makes it a must-have stock, despite the short-term risks.

How about now? NVIDIA's stock price and valuation just hit an all-time high, and many investors are wondering if NVIDIA is overvalued. Maybe they should take profits? Surely we'll see some short sellers active. For me, the journey has just begun. Since my recent article NVIDIA has announced some significant partnerships and at the recent GTC Paris conference its CEO made it clear to me that the growth story behind AI is continuing to accelerate. Let me bring you up to speed while we review whether NVIDIA remains a worthwhile buying opportunity.

It's worth noting that the US or Asia aren't the only ones committed to AI development - Europe is also active and not far behind. While Europe isn't often mentioned in these discussions (there's even a joke that the US owns AI while Europe has an ‘AI Act’ to regulate it), NVIDIA has highlighted its involvement in industrial/physical AI From the heart of Germany's automotive industry to the manufacturing hubs of France and Italy, Europe is adopting industrial AI and advanced AI robotics to address labour shortages, increase productivity and drive sustainable economic growth.

Robotics companies are developing humanoid robots and collaborative systems to integrate AI into real-world manufacturing applications. Backed by a $200bn investment programme and a coordinated effort by the European Commission, Europe is at the forefront of the next wave of AI-driven industrial automation.

It's easy to get caught up in concerns about potential overvaluation once the stock hits another record high. Take a look at NVDA's P/E ratio trend (I usually focus on EV/EBITDA, but it's showing the same trend). Since April 2025, the P/E has risen significantly as valuations have experienced a dynamic recovery (over 50%).

What's the key to deciding whether it's worth paying nearly $50 per share for $1 in earnings? It's the growth story behind NVIDIA and its continued path. NVIDIA's performance over the past few years suggests that it has a very good growth habit to reach its valuation levels. Just look at its P/E ratio in July 2023 - over 240x! Now, what surprises me is that buyers of NVIDIA actually made a lot of money during that time :)

How is that possible? NVIDIA's earnings are growing faster than its valuation. That's why you observe that valuation multiples have been declining since early 2024. Yes, the valuation multiple is now up nearly 50x, but ...... if NVIDIA continues on this path, delivers on its intended product roadmap, and the world continues to move towards an AI-driven economy, NVIDIA's current valuation will look cheap in a few years.

Risk factors? There are many, and there are no risk-free investments in the stock market. If the Trump administration escalates the trade war, which is currently on hold, NVIDIA could face some short-term issues that would impact NVIDIA's supply and customer operations. Yes, NVIDIA is well prepared for these changes, with some production being shifted to the U.S. and adjusted supply for Chinese customers (due to export restrictions). Any economic or geopolitical fluctuations could also hurt market sentiment, but in the long run I don't see this as a factor.

So, as an investor with a long-term focus and a bright future for NVIDIA, not only am I not selling any shares, I'm adding to my holdings. For me, NVIDIA remains a ‘Strong Buy’ stock. Cheers!",0,17,1751209517.0,2025-06-29T15:05:17+00:00,t3_1lngvg0,stocks

After 2-week losing streak, the stock market closed on the positive side. Despite the negative closes the past 2-week, the results were minimal and just 0.38 and 0.15. As you see the below, it was not deep correction. We've seen much bigger losses before like 9% in this year 😀

Here are the S&amp;P 500's week-by-week results,

May. 30 close at 5,911.69 - June 6 close at 6,000.36 🟢 (+1.49%)

🔸 Monday: The week started with monitoring to Middle East tensions. Before the session, White House said Trump 'Still interested' in Iran diplomacy. The stock market opened flat. Tesla launched a small fleet of self-driving taxis in Austin, Texas. The stock helped to lift the stock market because it gained more than 8%. However, Iran attacked U.S. bases in Doha, Qatar. In result, the S&amp;P 500 gained over 1% and closed above 6,000 once again. 🟢

🔸 Tuesday: Israel-Iran ceasefire agreement came and the stock market opened higher. Powell spoke at the congressional testimony and he still pointed to tariffs effect and inflation. The stock market closed with second session of solid gains. 🟢

🔸 Wednesday: Compared to previous 2-day, Wednesday was a quiet. The stock market opened slightly higher. During the session, Trump said 2 important things. First one is he going to talk to Iran next week. Second one is begun interviewing candidates to replace Fed Chair with 3 to 4 names. As a result, the stock market closed flat, but still in positive. 🟢

🔸 Thursday: Q1 GDP data was released before the session. The U.S. economy shrank 0.5%. On the other hand, jobless claims is the lowest level for 6-week. As a result, the stock market opened slightly higher. During the session, gains accelerated and closed nearly all-time high. By the way, U.S. Dollar dropped the lowest level since March 2022. 🟢

🔸 Friday: PCE inflation was released. Core PCE inflation came higher than expectations. It came mounthly at 0.2% and increased yearly from 2.6% to 2.7%. This is Fed's favorite economic indicator. We would have prefer equal or lower than expectations. However, Scott Bessent said a trade deal with China could be finalized by Labor Day. The stock market opened higher. Near the end of the session, Trump announced terminating all discussions on trade with Canada. The indexes tumbled, but recovered again. The S&amp;P 500 closed at new all-time high. 🟢

The next Fed meeting at July 29-30 and the stock market still isn't await rate cut (datas from CME FedWatch Tool which you can find via Google search). The stock market closed very good week. The only negative impact came from Trump yesterday. When I saw the message on Truth Social, I expected closed lower. However, the stock market closed at new all-time high.

Make no mistake, this is also a win for Google Cloud against Microsoft Azure,” says one Microsoft partner top executive. ‘[OpenAI] has continued, all year long, to loosen its dependency on Microsoft.

“Hats off to Google. They made the right R&amp;D moves to win over a customer with lots of money to spend,” said the executive.

Google has its own DeepMind AI lab that competes directly against OpenAI around developing large language models (LLMs) for AI customers.

“[OpenAI] will be spending a ton of money on Google. They have $10 billion in sales. There’s money to be made here by Google,” the solution provider executive said. “We’re a big Azure shop, but I can see Google making some headwinds with its chips and cloud business overall because of the money they’re going to make on OpenAI. ... But we’re still big believers that Microsoft will be the leader in the AI era.”

I’m a huge Google bull. I see AI as a naturally oligopolistic industry. Multiple winners are possible. Google will lose in some areas, but win in others. 

However, you need the full stack. Google has the full stack. The Hardware, The Software, The Data, The Network, The Capital, and The Employees. No one else has it all. And it’s working.

133,NVDA,Trump Announces Mineral Rights Deal With Congo What does this mean for the stock market?,"Just saw the big news: Trump brokered a mineral deal between the U.S. and the DRC that will give U.S. firms access to key minerals such as cobalt, tantalum, lithium, and copper in exchange for U.S. support for the Congo-Rwanda peace deal 

This looks like more than just geopolitical maneuvering, it could have long-term implications for the stock market and certain stocks.

Brief summary

The U.S., pushed by Trump, brokered a peace deal between Congo and Rwanda and signed a multi-billion dollar “minerals for security” agreement.

Trump's allies and private companies (including Massad Boulos) plan to invest over $500 million to build a smelter there, with the goal of moving away from dependence on the Chinese mineral chain.

Why this deserves investor attention

KEY MINERALS, STRATEGIC MATERIALS 

The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) controls roughly 70 percent of the world's cobalt and 60 percent of its tantalum reserves-metals widely used in electric car batteries, chips, electronics, and military technology.

If the U.S. can establish its own supply chain, the global industrial landscape could be rewritten.

Capital Flows Could Change 

If U.S. miners and tech companies get in first, companies like Freeport-McMoRan (FCX), Albemarle (ALB), or lithium material companies like Livent (LTHM) could be the winners.

 Geo Risks vs Market Opportunities 

The Congo situation remains complex - if a peace deal stands, commodity prices could stabilize and U.S. firms may be able to gain control of resources in the long term; conversely, a short-term landmine.

Impact on Tech &amp; EV Sectors 

OEMs such as Tesla and the battery chain (e.g., NVDA, TSLA, BATT-type ETFs) could benefit if cobalt and lithium supplies become more stable and EV production costs fall.

CURRENT MARKET REACTION: 

Global mining stocks rallied in the early stages of the peace deal rumors, but then retreated as details of the deal remain unclear

Market Sentiment: cautiously optimistic and bullish in the long term, but short-term uncertainties remain (situation, implementation, opposition factions, etc.)

My recommendations from an investment perspective

Long-term Layout Focus on resource stocks (e.g. ALB, FCX) - once the agreement is implemented, it is a probable event for US companies to acquire substantial mineral resources.

Medium-term ideas Tracking battery, electric vehicle sector - if the cost of raw materials downward, vehicle margins and growth logic benefit.

Short-term operation Pay attention to the progress of events - the peace agreement is unstable and may be repeated; if you intervene, you can add a stop loss or hedge.

Macro observation If the United States to “resource diplomacy” as a means of follow-up in Greenland, Ukraine and other places may also have similar operations.

Some of my questions

Has anyone been following cobalt or lithium resource stocks? Any early layouts for this wave?

134,NVDA,"Trump: US-China Trade Framework ""Signed""  Rare Earths Deal, Tariffs Rollback in Motion","Trump just said that the U.S. and China “signed” a framework deal on tariffs and trade. This follows the informal understanding they reached in Geneva back in May

Key points:

China confirmed both sides have finalized details of the framework

China will resume rare earth exports to the U.S

In return, the U.S. will remove countermeasures (probably the steep retaliatory tariffs).

Commerce Secretary Lutnick says 10 more trade deals are close mentions Canada, Japan, etc

Treasury Sec. Bessent says they want to wrap up trade talks by Labor Day (Sept 1)

The July 9 tariff deadline might get pushed back if talks show “good faith.”

Trump already sealed a deal with the UK; the EU is next, but tensions are high (threats of 50% tariffs on EU goods )

Stephen Miran (White House economic adviser) also said we may not see tariffs go below 10% long-term, but some countries could get better rates depending on how talks go

My take: This could be bullish for sectors exposed to China or dependent on rare earths (think EVs, semis, clean energy). If tariffs ease, expect to see some relief rallies across the board

157,NVDA,Why doest China allow USA buying rare earth in exchange for low tariffs ?,"Hi,

  
Sorry since the beginning of negociation of China and US , i understand nothing. USA make everything to impeach China developing their tech sector. So under Trump and Bider, China has lost a lot, included Huawei, the best china high tech company (P30 was so better than Iphone ...). Today, Huawei use a weak cpu and they don't have the right to use windows anymore. We can talk about ASML. USA forbid ASML to sell one of their big lithography machines. So today, China must use old machines to produce useless chipset. And the last hit was the ban of H20 made by Nvidia.

US will get rare earth and China will get :

\- Chinese student can study in US ...

\- 55% tariff instead 150 (or someting like that)

Seriously ? they will let US get rare earth just for that ? No Nvidia chipset ? no ASML machine ? no ban lefting ?

It's just crazy. Trump will get tariff and rare earth. Ok you will say ""omg my barbi or my shein clothes will cost more"", but we talk about limiting the growth of China first of all.

Also, ASML itself is very cutting edge on the innovation with hyper-NA etc.

434,NVDA,Why Qualcomm’s Latest Price Target Can’t Be Ignored,"As we head into the final week of June, **Qualcomm** continues to test investors’ patience. Even with a fundamentally solid earnings report in April and a tidy 25% gains since then, the tech giant is failing to ignite the kind of sustained uptrend seen in bigger peers like **NVIDIA** or **Broadcom**. Shares have been drifting downwards for nearly two weeks, though Monday’s 1% gain showed some welcome strength. The uptrend that began in April is technically still intact, but only just.

This lack of momentum has been especially frustrating given Qualcomm’s healthy diversification across handsets, automotive, and the Internet of Things (IoT), not to mention its recent M&amp;A activity.

And yet, analyst coverage has been sparse in comparison to other major chipmakers. That’s why last week’s update from Bank of America can’t be ignored.

# Bank of America Sees at Least 30% Upside

Bank of America’s research team, led by Tal Liani,reiterated its Buy rating on Qualcomm, though it trimmed its price target from $245 to $200. It’s a noteworthy move, while they’ve tempered expectations, they still see roughly 30% upside from where the stock closed on Monday.

Their reasoning was clear. As we mentioned above, Qualcomm’s Q2 earnings were solid, with the numbers coming in ahead of analyst expectations pretty much across the board. Its QCT segment, which includes the company’s core chip business, and its Handsets did especially well, while Automotive and IOT were both impressive too.

# Potential Headwinds for Qualcomm

The problem, though, according to Bank of America, is that some of its sales trends are showing signs of stagnation. As **Apple** , one of Qualcomm’s key customers, continues to bring more and more of its manufacturing in-house, Bank of America now expects its contribution to headset sales to fall sharply and potentially disappear altogether. That’s a huge headwind for a company still heavily dependent on smartphone cycles.

Still, they believe Qualcomm’s AI PCs and data center growth can offset some of the drag, though the company is lacking any near-term catalysts that could spark renewed bullishness. All that being said, however, their updated $200 target reflects a 15x multiple on their 2026 earnings estimate, which keeps Qualcomm looking extremely cheap relative to the sector. The stock’s current forward P/E sits below 14, in stark contrast to NVIDIA’s 46.

These risks aren’t new, but taken together, they help explain why the stock has struggled to build lasting momentum. The Bank of America team could easily have downgraded the stock to a Hold, but they didn’t, and investors should take confidence from that.

And with the stock trading at a highly unusual discount to its peers from a valuation standpoint, you can’t help but feel there’s a bargain to be had here - you might just have to wait a little longer than is ideal for the payoff.

# Watch the Chart

From a technical standpoint, Qualcomm is approaching an inflection point. Last week’s update would have helped spur some bullish interest, but the stock has been effectively trending down for the past fortnight. Crucially, the MACD just completed a bearish crossover, and momentum could turn negative if shares don’t start rallying north soon.

Given the S&amp;P 500 index is on the verge of an all-time record close, bulls will want to see Qualcomm move back towards $160 this week, which would mean it avoids setting a lower low and risking a breakdown of the uptrend.

As AI and edge computing continue to drive long-term demand, stocks like QCOM, AVGO, MAAS, MSFT, MU, and TXN could benefit from renewed infrastructure and device-side innovation, especially in areas like IoT and automotive connectivity.

For investors willing to stomach some near-term volatility, Qualcomm offers an intriguing mix of value, optionality, and a long-term AI tailwind. The latest analyst commentary should serve as a reminder that while the potential mightn’t be as bright as some others out there, it’s far from lost. But unless shares can shake off the lethargy and recapture momentum soon, it may take another upside surprise to get the stock firing again.",0,5,1750850059.0,2025-06-25T11:14:19+00:00,t3_1lk2wb3,stocks

142,NVDA,Opportunities in the short-term market volatility? I'm sharing a low-risk offensive strategy that I've been tracking recently,"Over the past few weeks, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq have been fluctuating repeatedly at high levels. Many friends have said, ""The direction is unclear and we dare not act."" But in fact, the oscillation range is precisely when the low-risk strategy comes into play.

Recently, I have been tracking a simplified version of a strategy that combines range-bound oscillation and breakout following. The core logic is:

After determining the key support/resistance areas in major indices (such as $SPY / $QQQ) or large-cap stocks (such as $AAPL / $NVDA), observe the changes in trading volume and K-line structure.

Place an observation order near the upper edge of the range. Once the volume increases and breaks through, follow to open small positions. If there is a false breakout, the stop-loss is extremely small (usually less than 1%).

Auxiliary indicators use simple moving averages (such as EMA20, EMA50) + RSI divergence to determine whether the breakout is healthy.

Last week, I followed up with a small position using this framework when $NVDA broke through 1100, with a profit target in the 1150 range. The stop-loss is set below 1085, and the risk is very controllable.

I wouldn't say this is a ""sure-win strategy"", but its advantage lies in:

The risk is low, the cost of making mistakes is low, and it does not rely on prediction but only on market signals. It is suitable for volatile markets and the initial trend formation stage

160,NVDA,Navitas Semiconductor : Big hate ??,"Hi everyone,

Sorry, my english is bad, i'm french.

I bought some navitas semicondutor after the nvidia partnership announcement. Of course, i was late and i got a very high price (7,97 per stock, fees and change inclued). Of course, like everytime i bought a stock, the stock drops like a stone. The last one was Genesis mineral : 10% loss.  I can't enjoy 3-4% after buying, my life is too bad to get this kind of little hapiness.

So i try to understand why the stock drop like that. Because every article i read about the nvidia partnership, everyone was OK to say this is a big pump for revenues. But, since, i've read only very negative article about Navitas Semiconductor, like ""the partnership is not very clear"" ""option is very low"" "" it's just an overhype"" ""the company is bad because they are dependant of china, so tariff will kill it""

Today, honestly, i don't know what i should think. I read the same shit about Coreweave ... So i hesitate to sell. Everyone knows July will be on fire about economic context : Big beautififul one at the Senate, the return of Tariff for Europe and South Asia (no agreement for the moment and the last news say no progression). So like before the liberation day, i will sell all my green position to save what i can. 

So it's hard for me to keep navitas at 7,9. Because this is the typical stock which drops very hard in this case of bad news ...

What do you think ?

436,NVDA,US Prepares Action Targeting Allies’ Chip Plants in China (WSJ),"By Liza Lin, Amrith Ramkumar and Raffaele Huang

(Wall Street Journal) -- A U.S. official told top global semiconductor makers he wanted to revoke waivers they have used to access American technology in China, people familiar with the matter said, a move that could inflame trade tensions.

Currently, South Korea's Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix as well as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing enjoy blanket waivers that allow them to ship American chip-making equipment to their factories in China without applying for a separate license each time.

Jeffrey Kessler, head of the unit in charge of export controls at the Commerce Department, told the three companies this week he wanted to cancel those waivers, according to people familiar with the meetings. They said Kessler described the action as part of the Trump administration's crackdown on critical U.S. technology going to China.

If carried out, the move could be disruptive both diplomatically and economically. Earlier this month, the U.S. and China agreed to a fragile trade truce in London. Part of the deal involved each country agreeing to hold off from introducing new export controls and other measures designed to hurt the other.

The action isn't a new trade escalation but would be designed to make the licensing system for chip equipment similar to what China has in place for rare-earth materials, White House officials said. The U.S. and China continue to make progress on completing the agreement they reached in London and negotiating on trade, they said.

""Chip makers will still be able to operate in China. The new enforcement mechanisms on chips mirror licensing requirements that apply to other semiconductor companies that export to China and ensure the United States has an equal and reciprocal process,"" a Commerce Department spokesman said.

A new step making it harder for global chip makers to operate in China might still strike Beijing as a betrayal of the London deal. It could also strain the relationship between Washington and friendly governments in South Korea and Taiwan, whose companies would be most affected and have promised large investments in the U.S. in recent years.

The Chinese factories in question -- including a Samsung memory-chip factory in the Chinese city of Xi'an -- are part of the global supply chain for memory, logic and other chips. While they generally don't have the most advanced technology, the factories' output is widely used in cars, consumer electronics and the like.

Industry officials said tighter curbs by Washington wouldn't immediately force the factories to shut down, but over time, they could find it harder to operate effectively. That would disrupt global industry as companies are dealing with other issues triggered by the U.S.-China trade war, such as China's limits on exports of rare-earth magnets.

The chip makers would likely seek case-by-case licenses from the U.S. government to supply their Chinese factories, while looking to replace U.S. equipment with alternatives from Japan and Europe.

People involved in the discussions said revoking the waivers isn't a done deal.

They said Kessler's unit -- the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security -- hasn't secured buy-in from other parts of the U.S. government, such as the Defense Department. Opponents in the administration worry eliminating the waivers would ultimately end up boosting Chinese companies and give China control of the plants.

Kessler and other national-security hawks have taken a hard line on cutting off China from American technologies, arguing that aggressive measures are needed to limit the country's advances in critical sectors and spur development of supply chains outside China. Those efforts have put them in conflict with pro-business officials.

In recent weeks, the administration has halted sales to China of more high-end chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices. That has dented the U.S. companies' revenue by billions of dollars. Commerce also weighed broad restrictions on sales of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China, although a White House official said that move was no longer under consideration.

The South Korean and Taiwanese companies have notified authorities in their home regions about the waiver issue, hoping for help lobbying against the move, people familiar with the discussions said.

Both South Korea and Taiwan are negotiating broader trade deals with Washington, part of a wave of agreements the Trump administration hopes to wrap up in the coming weeks.

The companies see their Chinese factories as important for competing against Chinese rivals, which are looking to win more global business as chip suppliers. Samsung's current U.S. waiver has allowed its Xi'an plant to make some advanced products that compete against China's Yangtze Memory Technologies, among others.

South Korea, a U.S. military ally, and Taiwan have worked with the U.S. in its technology race with China, including by limiting transfer of advanced technology to China. TSMC, Samsung and SK Hynix have all made multibillion-dollar investments in U.S. factories with backing from Washington.",122,27,1750431289.0,2025-06-20T14:54:49+00:00,t3_1lg60qm,stocks

Max profit $192k, max loss if coreweave goes to 0 is $273k. The $192k premium and $465k “cash” are in money market collecting 4 percent interest, which will yield another $6,700 between now and 9/19.

There are 64 more trading days left between now and expiration, IV is at 107%, 8-9% short position relative to float. Currently nvda holds a 7% stake in coreweave and a strategic partnership, which was partially responsible for the run up. Below is a summary of the partnership from nvda:

“The general availability of NVIDIA GB200 NVL72-based instances on CoreWeave underscores the latest in the companies’ collaboration, focused on delivering the latest accelerated computing solutions to the cloud. With the launch of these instances, enterprises now have access to the scale and performance needed to power the next wave of AI reasoning models and agents.

Customers can start provisioning GB200 NVL72-based instances through CoreWeave Kubernetes Service in the US-WEST-01 region using the gb200-4x instance ID. To get started, contact CoreWeave.”

Coreweave owns data centers in the US and Canada including the fastest super computer in the world that is powered by nvda chips. The strategic partnership (as well as ownership stake) gives coreweave dibs on the latest nvda chips, which gives coreweave a leg up over its competitors. In addition to Nvda, Microsoft is another major client. It is my opinion that we are just at the beginning of an AI arms race, coreweave is in a fantastic position to reap  the benefits from money from both private and public sectors indiscriminately flowing into anything related to AI. 

Biggest concerns include 1) 325% 3 months run making coreweave susceptible to major pull back, and 2) geopolitical tensions and tariff wars may tank the market. 

However, the concerns are short term, and are alleviated by the large premium (my break even is $87.94), the stock would need to drop almost 50% from Wednesday close for me to incur a loss. Worst case scenario, I am forced to buy 3,100 shares at a loss, I will sell covered calls and wheel my way to profitability. 

Best case scenario is that coreweave closes in the $150 range with high IV on 9/19 and I get to run it back again, while collecting more premium and interest.",83,111,1750344011.0,2025-06-19T14:40:11+00:00,t3_1lfchc3,wallstreetbets

159,NVDA,IonQ shares may plummet tomorrow,"Full disclosure: I have 6/20 puts at a 39 strike.

I’ve been following this massive insider sale story very closely since I first learned about the CEO filing his Rule 105b5-1 (intent to sell) of a vast majority of his shares. 

Background on IonQ, it’s a highly speculative quantum computing company that has nearly doubled in the last 90 days after its new CEO de Masi stepped in. De Masi has spent the last 90 days going on Bloomberg and CNBC advertising the impending breakthroughs in Quantum and the future value of his company being the next NVIDIA. He must be really excited about the long-term growth of this company and be heavily vested in its future success right? WRONG.

Him and his other executives/directors just sold a MASSIVE amount of their shares on Friday after hours. Like actually sold. Not just filing a form with the SEC with the “intent to sell. They filed Form 4s which are official sales. They collectively dumped $113M. With the CEO selling 80% of his shares. Many other executives with significant sales, some directors nearly completely cashing out. 

Ok so why is this a problem? Shouldn’t they be able to get paid? Yes and no. It’s not entirely uncommon for a CEO of a company to offload shares. Sometimes those volumes can be big. But if you’re the CEO of a $10B purely speculative tech company that is currently losing hundreds of millions a year with no foreseeable path to profitability, your ownership is key to investors conviction. If you aren’t aligned, how are we supposed to have faith in a long-term story.

He sold $103M, shouldn’t he be allowed to get rich? He’s got new incentive shares available if he hits milestones? He’s already rich…. he had tens of millions before cashing out. He’s not hurting in the lifestyle department. If he really thought this was the next NVIDIA as he said, his $103M could be worth billions in the future. If you already have more money than you’d ever spend, why the hell would you sell out? Because he’s calling the top, at least for now. He pumped the fuck out of the share price in his 90 days, and he knows this is the top. 

There is no good reason a company this unprofitable with tech that could be anyways from 5-20 years from being practical should be priced the way it is. Maybe there’s long term upside. If IonQ wins the quantum race. But right now it’s anyone’s game. Nothing is going to happen soon.

He already won, he cashed out at recent highs. As far as I’m concerned his future incentive based shares are meaningless because whether this works or fails he just got paid $103M for 90 days of work is cashed it. If IonQ goes to zero, he still has enough more to become a billionaire investing in the markets by the time he’s 80.

Alignment is broken. If people really consider the weight of this, they will dump. But it is so hard to rationalize with IonQ bulls because they are the epitome of moonshot speculators. They will do anything to justify a gross overvaluation for a purely speculative stock bc they all think this is “their money ticket”. It’s not, certainly not right now. De Masi knows more than us about where this company is going in the short/medium term and he just said he doesn’t want his money along for the ride. 

If you are long IonQ, you’ve got a ton of volatility headed your way and a CEO who doesn’t want his money on the table. If you’re a regard like me, there is huge opportunity in puts if morons stop artificially inflating the price.

This company should be priced for what it is, speculation. $1B market cap not $10B. $5 share price not $40-50. 

I may or may not win my bet, but holy shit this is shaping up to be one of the biggest pump and dumps I’ve seen of a speculative tech company in my life.

144,NVDA,All time highs on the horizon,"Nvidia Corporation is attractively valued and its strong EPS growth and profitability outpacing peers make it a compelling entry point. AI-driven demand from hyperscalers and new sovereign deals (UAE, Saudi Arabia) provides long-term headroom for continued growth. Despite the loss of China revenues and recent price stagnation, NVIDIA's fundamentals remain strong and its market leadership unquestioned. I am upgrading my rating on NVDA stock to Strong Buy, believing it is capable of delivering superior returns and has the potential to reach a $10 trillion valuation.



When I looked at NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA ) late last year, I thought the stock had a pretty good shot at 2025. While the stock has soared, the valuation has fallen because of strong earnings growth, thanks in large part to the seemingly never-ending demand for GPUs in exascale computing platforms. 2025 was destined to be the “Year of Blackwell,” and I expected the stock to continue to rise, albeit at a slower pace than in previous years.

Instead, we saw the stock briefly try to break out to a new all-time high, or ATH, before reversing sharply and selling off. We know the various reasons for this reversal. On the one hand, the broader market sold off amid tariff uncertainty, and few companies were immune. the release of DeepSeek (DEEPSEEK) in early 2025 triggered a sort of flash panic, with some claiming that the boom time for high-end chips was over. The logic was that DeepSeek would be able to save costs and increase efficiency so dramatically that companies running AI reasoning could rely on much less powerful chips. I think the evidence so far is that this reasoning is completely wrong, and instead we're seeing the Jevons Paradox come true.

It was probably inevitable that NVIDIA would now lose essentially all of its China-related revenue. At a recent conference, CFO Colette Kress pretty much poured cold water on the company's prospects for generating further revenue in China.

In my opinion, NVIDIA is attractively valued. The two best performers this year among the Big 7 tech giants have been Microsoft and Meta. looking at how NVIDIA compares to these peers, I see a big gap between them at the moment. In terms of price-to-earnings ratio, NVIDIA's valuation sits right in the middle of the three, but in terms of return on invested capital and medium-term EPS projections, it's way ahead.",0,13,1750002076.0,2025-06-15T15:41:16+00:00,t3_1lc3azy,stocks

The stock market waited for result from meeting and closed higher. 🟢

🔸 Wednesday: Important key datas will be released in the next 3 day. First one was CPI inflation. It came below expectations, but it raised from 2.3% to 2.4% for annual. The meeting has ended. U.S and China completed a 'framework' and send to Trump, Xi for approval. Trump said done. The stock market opened higher. Meanwhile, Scott Bessent pointed to increase U.S. debt ceiling must be raised and extended. It could be biggest crises since 2008-09. China will add 10% tariff on U.S. products and U.S. will add 55% tariff on China products. Both of news was positive, but the stock market closed lower. The S&amp;P 500 remained above 6,000. 🔴

The S&amp;P 500 closed 6,000 last week. It came nearly all-time-high value, but it struggled to reach this value. Israel-Iran conflict pulled it back to below 6,000. After the under 5,000 values, it made a strong recover. A bit correction could be healthy for the next level. The S&amp;P5 00 has a gap between 5,820 and 5,843. I think, this points could be good enry point for new positions. On the other hand, if we could reach to 6,100 points, we can open positions there. By the way, gold is benefiting from conflicts. It may be in the portfolio. I've been keeping for a long time. It's a bit insurance. How was your week? What do you think?

Here is what i think of the stocks left holding up the market. 

AAPL - weakness in innovation, losing growth

MSFT - might be overbought here

META - good ad business but questionable ai product profitability 

NFLX - high pe might give back massive gains its had

NVDA - ai sales increase already priced in. everyone says 170 eoy yet price is stalling. People relying on eoy to save them usually not a good thing. 

AMZN - aws has competition with new datacenter companies emerging. Needs to take on more debt just to maintain its margin intensive shipping business 

GOOG - losing search dominance, ai is good but not perfect yet, to maintain ai dominance intensive spending must happen will affect earnings

COST - taking a hit from tarrifs, it had a monster run and might give back a lot of gains

TSLA - lead roles stepping down, doesn’t look good for promises of products happening.

[**BA (Boeing)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BA&amp;p=d)\-Air India Flight AI171, a Boeing 787‑8 Dreamliner carrying 242 people from Ahmedabad to London, crashed shortly after takeoff on June 12, 2025 due to suspected bird strikes. Boeing shares plunged \~8% pre‑market as this marks the 787’s first ever crash with total loss. Mainly interested to see if there is some kind of selloff and subsequent recovery. BA always has some selloff when there is a plane crash, but frankly this appears to be a bird strike so mainly a fault of the pilots and not the company (for what we know now).

163,NVDA,Is the AI Frenzy Far from Over? Which Concept Stocks Are Reaching New Highs?,"There has been a chart circulating online comparing the stock trends of Cisco vs. Nvidia. The sharp decline in $NVIDIA (NVDA.US)$'s stock price at the beginning of the year brings back memories of Cisco in the 1990s. After the burst of the dot-com bubble, companies like $Cisco (CSCO.US)$ and $Intel (INTC.US)$ saw their stock prices plummet. Investors want to know if Nvidia will face the same fate.

However, there has been a new twist in this chart. On April 30th, a pivot occurred with Microsoft's earnings; Nvidia also continued its upward trend when it announced a series of contracts from the Middle East.

The quarterly earnings released by Microsoft sends a clear message: the AI juggernaut rolls on, at least for now. Since the earnings release, Microsoft's stock price has soared over 17%. This news has been comforting to the entire AI sector, proving that companies are not disappointed in this highly hyped technology. Microsoft's strong performance has also led the market to infer an increased demand for Nvidia chips.

Additionally, with Trump and bin Salman endorsing the US-Saudi AI deal, Nvidia said it will sell hundreds of thousands of AI chips in Saudi Arabia, with a first tranche of 18,000 of its newest ""Blackwell"" chips going to Humain, an AI startup just launched by Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund. Nvidia's stock price has recovered from its sharp decline at the beginning of the year.

**Is the AI frenzy far from over?**

Recent trends in AI concept stocks indicate that the AI ""stock market fuel"" is far from running out. On Monday, $Applied Digital (APLD.US)$ announced a transformative $7 billion, 15-year AI data center lease agreement with $CoreWeave (CRWV.US)$, a leading AI hyperscaler. Applied Digital saw its stock price skyrocket by 48.46%, closing at $10.14. Meanwhile, CoreWeave's stock has more than doubled since the start of the year.

$Tempus AI (TEM.US)$, a ""precision medicine"" company that leverages artificial intelligence to better treat patients, Shares soared 15% on Monday. Late Friday, the company announced an initiative it calls Fuses, a program designed to transform therapeutic research and build the largest diagnostic platform using its novel foundation model. Since the beginning of the year, Tempus AI's stock has surged by 88%, while the telehealth firms $Hims &amp; Hers Health (HIMS.US)$ has skyrocketed nearly 135%.

**$Palantir (PLTR.US)$'s stock price has also continued to reach new highs, rising 74% since the beginning of the year. The up-and-coming AI firm $BGM is up over 88% so far this year.**

Furthermore, $Broadcom (AVGO.US)$ will release its second-quarter financial report after the market closes on June 5th. Wall Street expects the chipmaker to report growing revenue and profits fueled by demand for AI chips. Broadcom may soon become the first big tech stock to break historical highs. Its current stock price is $248.71, just under 1% lower than the peak of $250.45 in December last year.",0,8,1749650193.0,2025-06-11T13:56:33+00:00,t3_1l8tc5g,StockMarket

I know this company that was recommended on subreddits focused on smXXl cxps. And it's true, the technology is really interesting, but often, it takes years, and sometimes, these companies go under along the way... But this time, they just signed a partnership with Nvidia for data centers. Apparently, they have a technology that’s going to revolutionize the infrastructure. Just a few days ago, the stock was trading at $2, today, it's at $8. While all my other stocks were tanking today, Navitas was still up another 20%...

I follow the news quite closely, and yet I'm constantly bombarded with talk about big caps and the MAG7 instead of putting the spotlight on companies like this one, which just closed a deal that could push it to an entirely new level. I'm frustrated to miss out on this kind of opportunity, because it really could have been a meaningful investment,even just 3–4 days after the announcement.

But instead of hearing about this kind of news, we have to put up with nonsense about Tesla, Apple and their stupid Vision Pro, Microsoft doing nothing new with Windows anymore... and I’m forgetting others.

The company generated NT$320.5 billion ($10.7 billion) in revenue last month. While this marks a strong annual increase, it's an 8.3% decline from April, when TSMC saw a sharper 48.1% year-over-year gain.

Revenue for January through May 2025 totaled NT$1,509.34 billion, an increase of 42.6% compared to the same period in 2024.

Looking ahead, analysts project a 50.3% Y/Y increase in TSMC's second-quarter sales, signaling continued robust demand despite month-over-month volatility.

TSMC chief executive and Chairman C.C. Wei said last week that the demand for the company's AI chips continues to outweigh supply.

The chipmaker reported strong Q1 results in April and issued a positive outlook for the coming years. ""We continue to observe robust AI related demand from our customers throughout 2025. We reaffirm our revenue from AI accelerators to double in 2025,"" said Wei on the earnings call.",115,11,1749590117.0,2025-06-10T21:15:17+00:00,t3_1l8an4a,stocks

Take a look at this chart.

Orange line = SPX  
Blue line = SPX without AAPL, MSFT, META, NFLX, NVDA, AMZN, GOOGL, COST

Now tell me honestly… is this really a bull market?

Or is it mostly tech bull market where tech names like Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, Netflix and Google and Amazon too... 

Because if you remove these 7 tech names plus Costco too, the rest of the market looks like it’s been going sideways or even rolling over hard. This ain't a healthy, broad-based rally. It’s basically just a handful of mega caps doing all the heavy lifting while the rest of the market is lagging behind big time. 

There are other few more stocks that have done well such PLTR and WMT and HOOD and UBER that are much at their ATH... Feels like everyone’s celebrating all-time highs, but under the surface it's a different story.

This potential investment has raised many questions:

Is Meta attempting to establish an internal foundational model system in order to reduce its reliance on external suppliers such as OpenAI and Anthropic?

Does this mean that the focus has shifted from the attention to the metaverse to the emphasis on artificial intelligence infrastructure and vertical integration?

What kind of impact will this have on other stocks related to artificial intelligence? For instance, stocks like $NVDA, $PLTR, or $SNOW?

Google has really caught up with the rest of the Mag 7 giants in their AI advancements if you haven't noticed.  They have been doing AI machine learning since 2001.  Bard was unimpressive, but that was only little over a year ago.  The speed at which they have been making new advancements is almost hard to track (even across other LLM's).

Have you tried Gemini?  VEO 3 costs 250/m and people are loving it. (the rev. from that will be great as well) and the new AI mode for search seems to finally have been embraced and I think they can actually leverage AI to better serve people the right business ads / referrals.  ***Either way they are monetizing AI***\*...\*

Regarding all the FUD, I dont believe the judge can make them sell chrome, EU case is just stupid, the whole thing is about them having monopoly on search and ads...  well there is Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo, Perplexity, Meta / Instagram business Ads, etc..  they have no monopoly anymore if there was one...

I dont believe the cases will result in anything materially bad for the stock but nobody can be sure, so that is why I want to dig into the Fundmental and Technical Analysis.

*VEO 3, AI Mode, Gemini, DeepMind* \- Competing with GPT pro, Microsoft, etc.  (note VEO 3 is still the only model that does text to video PLUS audio.  I think they leveraged youtube for it.

**Data Centers / Internet Provider:**

\-----*Google Cloud, TPU's, Google Fiber* \-Competing with many, but their TPU's are very good for AI data centers, and google Fiber competes with internet / service providers like AT&amp;T / Comcast / T-Mobile, etc..

**Quantum Computing:**

\------Competing with Microsoft, IBM, Rigetti, etc.

**Smart Phones:**

\------*Android, Pixel Phone* (with Gemini that kicks Siri's ass) - competing with Apple big-time

**Streaming / Ads:**

\------*Youtube &amp; Google Ads* \- Competing with Meta and Netflix

**Smart Home / Wearables:**

\------*Nest, Fitbit,* &amp; ***XR Glasses*** \- Competing with Amazon, Apple's announced glasses and their 'watch', Microsoft, etc.

**Autonomous Driving / UAV Delivery:**

\------***Waymo, Wing*** \- Competing with Tesla (been kicking their ass on it for a while now), GM, and yes, Amazon Air delivery.  *They also just announced another partnership with Walmart to bring more drones to over 100 stores for deliveries!*

**AI in Healthcare / Biotech:**

\------*Verily, &amp; Calico* \- working on aging / genetics and ai in healthcare.

When you buy GOOGL you are buying the entirety of Alphabets investments.  And they are so well positioned from a fundamental and financial perspective as seen in this group of charts.  They make double nearly double the revenue of Nvidia...

[Google makes more revenue than the rest of the Mag 7, nearly double Nvidia's earnings!  the only exception of Apple which could be in jeopardy too if they dont continue to innovate.](https://preview.redd.it/i61ok3bywl5f1.png?width=1183&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab383da02f61b9d5fdc7bb71ce2bde6c7d453ac2)

\-

Yet oddly, Google has the lowest P/E (price to earnings) ratio than the rest of the Mag 7!  That seems off if you ask me.  I believe they can take plenty of market share back in the future based on these 2 figures.

# -------- Technical Analysis --------

so now lets look at the Chart!  Because Price Action Speaks more than anything else...

I like to use Multiple Timeframes for analysis so here I have the 4 hour, daily, and weekly charts.

I know there are a lot of lines and colors, dont be scared.  The indicators I use are patterns combined with price action, fib levels, TTM squeeze, RSI and some other factors such as price gaps.

\- With RSI, above/below the 50 line tells you if momentum is bullish or bearish.  All the higher timeframes are above that 50 line indicating a potential bullish reversal.

\- With TTM it makes it easier to visualize these momentum shifts.  Right now my focus is on that Weekly chart on the bottom right - higher time frames are usually more important and it appears to be on the verge of a weekly breakout.  Now with a stock like this it could take months to reach that earnings Gap and make a new all time high.  When or If this happens depends on a lot of factors, but I am only focusing on the chart.

\- The Fibonacci Retracements I mostly use for the 50% line to determine if the price has had a change of trend.  Right now the price is attempting a breakout above this retracement and if it can break over 175 then there is plenty of room up.

\- Ive also illustrated some patterns and concepts on the chart.  Inverted Head and Shoulders, Trendline Break, Higher Highs and Higher Lows, potentially an even larger inverted H&amp;S on the daily chart to the top right.

https://preview.redd.it/d2fprue33m5f1.jpg?width=3676&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77f0a1e390e7b81ec6f893f6f38220ffc3fde21f

Ok so what does this technical analysis mumbo jumbo mean?  Its hard to say because of Trump, Tarrifs, Deals, Interest Rates, Bonds, Geopolitics, the fact that the market has already just about reached all time highs and this is lagging...  it is concerning.  It could also just be setting up for a massive (bearish) head and shoulders as you might notice on the bottom right weekly chart.

But with WWDC, RoboTaxi, and several trump deals supposedly taking place next week, we could be setup for some bullish continuation if these tech events impress.  Either way, Long Term I believe Google / Alphabet stock will get back to 200.

From a technical and fundamental perspective they are in great shape.  I would even bet that if the market pulls back, that institutions may rotate their Mag 7 holdings into the laggards such as this and Amazon.

While they are aggressively competing with so many different companies and industries, their earnings are expected to continue to grow and as you saw earlier, they earn double what Nvidia earns... Pelosi still has calls, and lets face it, you still use some kind of google product in your life whether its youtube, your android based phone, ai / gemini research, waymo, etc...  I believe Google is well positioned to be a winner this year in AI and many of its subsidiary company products.

\--------------

# TLDR:

**Alphabet is a great Bet !**

I currently am selling put credit spreads on GOOGL, and have several 180 calls for 7/18 that I only plan to hold through next week before I re-enter as there is going to be a lot going on next week for the markets.  Their earnings are on 7/22 I believe, so August may be a better strike date.  Shares or LEAPS (calls dated atleast for 2026) are also a good idea IMO, you can sell calls against them to hedge when there are large spikes.

**Anyway, I am highly regarded** ***and this is not financial advice,*** but I am very bullish on Google long term.  Its not an easy one to trade if you like short dated options, you need patience, but the chart, the p/e ratios, the incredible amount of subsidiaries competing with more than other Mag 7 companies makes this thing a highly undervalued growth &amp; value stock.

*Price Target short term - 180*

*Price Target long term - 200+*

150,NVDA,"Earnings up, yields up   is Trump’s $3T bill a bull trap in disguise?","Everyone’s watching the Musk vs. Trump drama like it’s the main event, but markets should probably be paying more attention to what’s actually in Trump’s $3T “big beautiful bill”  because it’s very much alive and moving forward

Despite Musk calling out GOP lawmakers, threatening primaries, and warning about the deficit (which, by the way, multiple analyses say will balloon by $2.4T+), the bill’s still on track. Thune and Senate leadership basically shrugged him off. They’re pushing this thing through  and fast

Here’s where it gets interesting from a market angle:

They're talking about cutting back the $40K SALT deduction to save money. But whatever they save might immediately get canceled out because there's also strong pressure to make temporary business tax breaks permanent  stuff like R&amp;D deductions, bonus depreciation, and interest expensing

That’s a huge deal if you're long big-cap tech, industrials, or healthcare. These tax breaks boost reported earnings pretty directly. If they go permanent, EPS estimates probably move higher without companies having to do anything operationally. Think MSFT, LMT, UNH  names like that

But here’s the tradeoff: the bill’s already inflationary. If they don’t pay for it, bond yields are going to feel it. So while stocks might get an earnings tailwind, valuations could stay capped or even compress further if the 10Y starts creeping above 5% again

And the AI provision buried in the bill? Wild. Originally it said states couldn’t regulate AI for 10 years — a total federal preemption. Now they’re walking that back to a softer “you lose broadband funding if you pass certain laws” version. Doesn’t matter much fiscally, but for megacaps like NVDA and GOOG, this is one less regulatory headache. The moat just got a little deeper

One curveball that could raise the cost: Section 899. It lets the president slap taxes on foreign countries seen as ""discriminatory."" Some senators want to remove it, which could limit future revenue and geopolitical leverage. Not a today problem, but if you're watching defense and energy stocks tied to foreign trade, it matters

And now there's infighting about Medicaid cuts. Josh Hawley’s out here writing NYT op-eds saying this bill punishes working-class voters while handing corporate tax cuts. He’s not totally wrong. If the GOP starts shifting back toward economic populism, how long do these business-friendly tax policies actually last?

So here’s the real market question buried in all this: Are we about to get an earnings boost that the bond market completely wipes out?Because if you’re buying the earnings upgrade but ignoring the debt story  you might be trading the right trend with the wrong multiple",908,246,1749332408.0,2025-06-07T21:40:08+00:00,t3_1l5vyh4,stocks

In general, this week came a lot of key data about the job market and the results were mixed. If there hadn't been any debate between Trump and Elon Musk, we might have closed the week with 5 green days. However, the stock market shifted focus to that story after Thursday. Our agenda remains similar to previous weeks: tariffs, debt concerns, and rate cut decisions.

🔸 Monday: This week began with tariffs concern again. Trade tensions between the U.S. and China escalated. Trump announced new steel tariffs. On the other hand, Fed's Waller said tariffs are likely cause a one-time price increase and 10% tariff can get inflation up to 3%. As results, the stock market opened slighly lower. Both sides allegations each other of violating a trade-war truce. By the end of the day, the stock market recovered loses and closed higher. 🟢

🔸 Tuesday: The U.S. extended the tariff pause on some Chinese goods to August 31. The stock market reached positively and opened higher. Job openings data was released and came in slightly higher above expectations and last month, but it still below the average for the year. The tariff pause news boosted semiconductor stocks and they helping to lift the indexes. The S&amp;P500 closed higher. 🟢

🔸 Wednesday: Several key datas released about job market in this week and it came mixed. The ADP Nonform Employment Change showed only 37K new jobs and the lowest level since February 2022. However, Trump mentioned plans to speak with Xi. For the markets, tariff concerns remained the most important things. The stock market opened slightly higher. On the commodities side, gold declined again $3,380. The stock market closed higher, but the S&amp;P 500 gained only 0.01% and extended winning streak to 3-day. 🟢

🔸 Thursday: Geopolitical risks continued to rise. Trump announced a full travel ban on 12 countries and partial restrictions on 7 others. Weekly continuing jobless claims were released and reached 247K that the highest level since November 2024. Trump and Xi held phone call though no details were disclosed. The stock market opened slightly higher. During the session, silver broken the $34 level after 10-week and surged to $36 that the highest level since February 2012. Another major issue emerged for the market that public debate between Trump and Elon Musk. Tesla shares plunged more than 14% in a single day. This issue dragged the stock market lower and closed. By the way, European Central Bank cut interest rates by 25 points in eighth consecutive cut. 🔴

🔸 Friday: Nonfarm Payrolls data was released and came in higher than expected. The stock market opened up more than 0.5%. Trump announced that meeting with Chinese officials on June 9 in London. This gave the market a slight boost and it closed up more than 1%. As a result, the S&amp;P 500 closed at 6,000. 🟢

6,000 level is a major psychological threshold for investors. In the 5,000 levels, there were many news of hedge fund managers sold their positions. They had look to very negative outlook on the market. After that points, news about Europe surprised and those investors missed the rally. They're now waiting for a correction to enter, but the stock market has not given any opportunity so far. If they give up waiting and start buying, could we reach a new all-time high? What do you think for next week?

151,NVDA,My inability to follow my intuition has cost me hundreds of thousands of dollars,"I messed up last year and even when I know the fundamentals of a stock are sound, I don’t invest.

I’ve built a strong intuition over the years. In the early 2020s, I trusted it and went all in on NVDA with $40k—and it turned into hundreds of thousands. But then I got cocky. I listened to my brother-in-law (never again), invested in a stock without doing research, and lost $70k. Since then, my confidence has been tainted.

I dedicate myself to rigorous research, spending hours each day on relevant reading. While some may claim I’ve made poor investment choices, that’s simply not the case. I’ve studied The Intelligent Investor along with several other books recommended by Warren Buffett, treating them like a college curriculum—complete with notecards and in-depth analysis. My investment strategy blends both value and growth principles.

My family have come to know I make good recommendations, so they ask me would I would buy:

* my brother asked so I recommended Palantir at $20. He’s up 500%.
* my friend asked so I recommended Vista &amp; Constellation Energy, and NuScale. All up huge.
* my uncle asked so I recommended MicroStrategy at $150. Up 147%.
* my brother-in-law asked so I recommended CoreWeave—he’s up 139%.
* my sister asked so I recommended the Circle IPO via Robinhood—up 167%.

Meanwhile, I’ve just been sitting on the sidelines, scared of losing more, stuck in analysis paralysis. That $70k loss deeply affected my self-image.

Has anyone else been through this? Lost big and then lost your confidence? How did you get it back?

I’m disabled and have severe chronic pain throughout my body. It’s not just investing that I have a hard time regulating…. It’s life itself. I constantly have fight or flight emotions coursing though my veins. I think EMDR is probably the answer im looking for.

EDIT:
Just wanted to update everyone! Three days ago, I took the advice from some very helpful Redditors and invested $10,000 across SMR, CCJ, and OKLO. So far, they're performing nicely! 😊

To those who were kind and supportive—I’m genuinely grateful for your insights. You've helped me start rebuilding my nest egg.

To the negative folks, maybe next time try a bit of empathy, especially towards someone already dealing with emotional and physical pain. It makes a difference.",304,414,1749255751.0,2025-06-07T00:22:31+00:00,t3_1l57sog,stocks

Amazon circulates not only packages through the physical economy, but data, as I'm sure you know. Without the blood, the brain (NVDA), cannot function. Every sizable company depends on Amazon in some way or another. 

AWS, okay-- google cloud and azure included, are perpetually undervalued because the investor looks at expenses. I look at it as an infrastructure.

I got in on AMZN 164 shares \* 184 avg. I bought positions in MSFT and GOOG to hedge a bit.

Amazon, however, will be my biggest holding for my entire life most likely. Of course, I do not know, but I see it as more probable than improbable. 

It cannot transport its connection. Amazon is going to be the greatest investment of my generation (born 2002)

153,NVDA,China Trade Deal Next Monday - Could This Be a Game Changer for the Market?,"The agreement could bring clarity on tariffs, supply chains and maybe even some strategic partnerships With both countries under pressure to resolve ongoing trade tensions, the deal might ease investor concerns and restore some confidence in global trade  
  
Companies like AAPL NVDA and INTC could see movement due to trade implications. A favorable deal might give these companies the green light for continued business operations in China, potentially boosting their stock prices

Chinese consumer demand could get a significant boost especially for companies with exposure in the region like NKE or SBUX However if the deal falls short of expectations those stocks could take a hit 

 Even though we’re all hoping for a positive agreement the market could react negatively if the deal is underwhelming or doesn’t address key issues like intellectual property or market access. In addition, this trade deal could bring forward inflation concerns if the economic impact is stronger than expected

I'm personally looking at **tech** stocks next week If the deal brings positive sentiment I'm expecting a short-term rally in these sectors However I'm also hedging my bets with some **puts** on broader indices in case the deal disappoints and causes volatility

155,NVDA,CRWV: AI Rocket or Debt Bomb? Thoughts?,"Alright, looked into **CoreWeave (CRWV)**. It's an ""AI Hyperscaler"".. gives GPU (Nvidia) for AI stuff. Stock went nuts since IPO (like 300% up)  

**Quick Take:** CRWV: Big AI growth, Nvidia likes them. BUT huge debt, only 2 big clients (MSFT, OpenAI), and weird deals with Nvidia &amp; Applied Digital where they invest in each other.

**The Good:**

* **AI Demand:** Selling GPU power for AI. Revenue shot up: $229M (2023) to maybe $8B (2025 est).Q1 2025 rev $981.6M, +420% YoY. 
* **Nvidia Favored?** Gets Nvidia's new GPUs (GB200s) early. Nvidia invested, owns \~7%. 
* **Huge Contracts:** $10B Microsoft deal (MSFT is 72% of Q1 rev!).\~$16B from OpenAI. 
* **Stock Surge:** Stock jumped big after IPO from AI hype &amp; news. 

**The Bad:**

* **Massive Debt:** Over $12.7B raised (equity/debt) by end 2024, liabilities &gt;$18.8B Q1 2025. Interest could be $2B+/year.S-1 said ""material weaknesses in internal control"". Not great.  
* **No Profit:** Big revenue, still big losses. Net loss $863M (2024), $314.6M (Q1 2025). 
* **Few Customers:** MSFT is 72% of revenue. OpenAI other main one. Risky.  
* **Nvidia Reliance:** All GPUs from Nvidia. If Nvidia has issues, CRWV does too.  

**The Weird Loops:**

* **Nvidia:**
   * Nvidia investor (\~7% stake). 
   * CRWV buys all GPUs from Nvidia. So NVDA invests, CRWV buys NVDA chips.  
   * NVDA *did* pay CRWV for services ($320M deal 2023).Now NVDA says not a customer, and Q1 rev from them &lt;10%. So NVDA invests -&gt; CRWV buys NVDA GPUs -&gt; NVDA *used to* pay CRWV. Circular.  
* **Applied Digital (APLD):**
   * CRWV has \~$7B, 15yr lease deal with APLD for data centers. 
   * CRWV also has warrants for \~5.5% of APLD. So CRWV is big APLD customer AND investor.  

**So?**

Is CRWV a smart play with AI giants, or a debt bomb waiting to go off if partners, debt, or AI hype fails? They're racing to make cash from contracts to pay debt &amp; upgrade GPUs before tech gets old. 

What u think? Big win or big fail?

156,NVDA,Is NVIDIA Getting Too Hot? My Short-Term Concerns with NVDA ($141.92),"I wrote my thesis on Palantir 30 mins before posting this one and looks like folks are not liking it. Long term NVDA could go up. This is purely a short term play. 

This is going to be a similar take to that one. 

NVIDIA’s been on an insane run lately. It was up over 20% since mid May and pushing back to all time highs around $142. The AI hype is obviously still alive and well. I genuinely believe AI is the future but still we need to be a bit more realistic.

Here’s what’s making me cautious:

* Options activity is nuts right now — the $140–$150 calls are getting snapped up like crazy
* Lots of short-dated call buying, mostly retail
* The whole “it can’t go down” vibe is creeping back in
* The stock’s up 10–12% straight with barely any pause

To be clear, I’m not saying NVDA is a bad company. It’s a beast, and the AI story is real. But even the strongest stocks usually pull back a bit after a move like this.

I’m looking at a possible short if it pushes into the $143–$145 range. Nothing aggressive, just a trade idea. Thinking we could see a pullback to $135ish (which lines up with the last breakout zone).

157,NVDA,Investing $5000 as a 17 Year Old,"I am a 17 Year Old With $9000 and want to know if this plan is okay. For context, I used to be a server which is how I made my money, but now I do not work and only earn a bit of money though babysitting/selling my old clothes/etc. This money has just been sitting in my checking and savings account for the last 3 years, earning less than a dollar of interest per year ...

I did a lot of research and made a plan for what to do with this money. Keep in mind I am going to college in the fall, but I don't have to do any loans/payment because I got a lot of scholarships and parents got the rest. So I just wanted to ask how my plan is and if anyone has any advice:

Checking account: $750 (I'm pretty frugal/don't spend much money, though I know I will have to spend more in college)

High Yield Savings Account: $3000

Stocks (About $4500) These are the ones I currently have picked out and how much I would put in. Should I get rid of any and just put it all in SPLG or SCHD or is this ok?

SPLG (50%) SCHD (35%) VUG (10%) NVDA (5%)

then i was thinking about putting $500 in a Vanguard Target Retirement Fund. But should I just wait until I get a part time job (probably a few months) to make a Roth IRA? Because you need income to contribute to one right?

To summarize I just want to know if those stocks I picked are good or if I should get rid of some or choose others, and if I should make a Vanguard Target Retirement Fund or wait until I have a job to make a Roth IRA.",0,30,1749069950.0,2025-06-04T20:45:50+00:00,t3_1l3glu5,stocks

Will buy more incrementally until I've deployed $50k into it and thats my cutoff for this ticker. I don't go super heavy on stuff like this (\*\*\*screenshot added in comments\*\*\*).

Yes I am talking about the thing you have in the junk drawer:

I am a senior level IC at a FAANG and deal with AI regularly and I only buy stocks in things I deal with and understand.

I looked into this when my wife came home with the wrong type of thumb drive for her stupid Macbook (a Sandisk that requires a USB - thank you Apple for removing those fucking ports on everything). Was curious if this was a company I could short and then learned what they were doing. Now I think this is a sleeper pick that nobody's really paying attention to.

**Product deep dive:**

* NVIDIA certified Sandisk’s Gen5 eSSDs for datacenter use. Certification means they're officially in the vendor chain for AI servers.
* Additionally, they've also built something called High Bandwidth Flash (HBF) which is a new memory architecture built for massive memory capacity and throughput (important for AI). Nobody else is making this and it's developed in-house (one of the main reasons I bought).
* Sandisk is shipping one of the most power-efficient flash technologies available right now, BiCS8.
* Cloud sales—12% of Sandisk’s total output went to AWS/GCP/Azure this quarter, up from 8% a year ago. My employer is one of these and our AI spend is essentially a blank check. It's kind of an arms race right now.
* AI spend isn't going to stop. I work in a part of a FAANG where we're seeing complete transformation plans to overhaul our customer-facing service into an AI-heavy experience. Yes a lot of companies are bleeding money on this but a lot aren't. I see the sales numbers and the internal productivity boost we've gotten is insane.

**Brand shift:**

Yes they do still make consumer stuff. But IGAF about thumb drives sold at Walmart. What they are building gives them a seat at the table for large AI-related deals.

**Earnings TLDR:**

* Revenue: $1.7B
* Adjusted free cash flow: $220M
* Cash on hand: $1.5B
* Forecast: demand strengthening through year-end
* Gross margin took a hit (22.7%), but they’re working on it through pricing and cost controls

This was their first full quarter as a standalone company after separating from Western Digital. Still early.

**Other areas they’re moving into:**

* **EV**: Flash tech being used for autonomous driving, just nominated Ford Supplier of the Year. NOTE: I am not an EV person and haven't really gone down this rabbit hole. I'm just looking into the AI side.
* **Gaming**: Their new SSDs are winning “Best Of” awards
* **Content creation**: Rolled out pro-grade memory cards and high-performance portable SSDs

**Risks:**

* Gross margins were down this quarter—mostly due to pricing pressure and the usual NAND volatility
* Consumer segment is still soft
* Goodwill impairment made GAAP numbers ugly (-$1.8B), though this was non-cash and tied to the separation
* This is absolutely a lotto play.
* Thin options liquidity. I just got shares.

I could be wrong here, but that would also be very on-brand in this subreddit.",116,191,1749049019.0,2025-06-04T14:56:59+00:00,t3_1l37omv,wallstreetbets
368,NVDA,$APLD: This ain’t a stock. It’s a launchpad. Public Pureplay on the AI Bottleneck.,"I’m long APLD.

Applied Digital is a developer of next-generation infrastructure for AI. They have two segments: (i) custom-built, high-performance data centers; and (ii) GPUs as a service. Applied is currently focused on a large 400MW data center project in Ellendale, ND, and is marketing a 1.4GW pipeline of additional capacity. Please see the company’s latest investor presentation on their website for more details. 

There is a frenzy for compute power by both hyperscalers and Fortune 500 companies, covered extensively everywhere you look. Power and datacenter capacity is the new bottleneck. Nvidia’s CEO, Jensen, has and continues to discuss the need to modernize a trillion dollars worth of data centers to tap into AI’s potential. APLD is a first mover aiming to capture this opportunity.

APLD’s history in developing power hungry crypto hosting sites in low-cost power locations was the perfect preparation for today’s AI opportunity. APLD’s foray into North Dakota for cheap electricity to fund crypto mining left the company with relationships and access to massive low cost power, low cost land with space for expansion, room for additional wind/solar farms to be integrated, state tax incentives, and cooler temperatures which are beneficial for the TCO of high density AI data centers. A healthy dose of luck contributed to locking up this opportunity, industry participants have told me you cannot underscore just how valuable this power and first mover advantage is for prospective customers. If GPUs are the pickaxes behind the AI revolution, power guys are swinging the axes.

**Unit Economics and Valuation**

**HPC Data Centers**
The rule of thumb for data centers is it costs $8-12 million per MW to build and each MW can generate ~$1mm of NOI. Applied Digital’s Ellendale campus has signed 250 MW of 15-year leases with CoreWeave, expected to generate $7 billion of total revenue over those 15 years (≈$466.7 million per year). That works out to ≈$1.867 million of revenue per MW per year. Assuming a typical HPC/data center EBITDA margin of 50–60 %, each MW will likely produce $0.9–$1.2 million of NOI per year. Therefore, the 250 MW currently under contract should yield $233–$280 million of NOI annually. At a 5–6 % cap rate, that implies an enterprise value (TEV) in the $3.9–$5.6 billion range for the signed 250 MW. If the full 400 MW build is leased at similar economics, total NOI would be $360–$480 million per year, implying TEV of $6–$9.6 billion. The remaining 150 MW of backlog could contribute up to $150 million of additional annual NOI—i.e., another $2.5–$3 billion of TEV—if signed at comparable rates. 

Locking in the 250 MW CoreWeave lease translates into roughly $3.3–$5.17b of equity, or about $15–$23 per share. Each additional 100 MW of backlog, using $0.9–$1.2 m of NOI per MW and a 5–6 % cap rate, would be worth approximately $5/share using the same math. If Applied is able to lock in 1.4GW of projects, that’s an additional $70/share of value that could be created. Haircut all of this however you prefer. The numbers can get wild.

**Applied Digital Cloud**
This segment has not been a focus for the company or the investment community recently, but is an underappreciated lotto ticket. Think of it as an early-stage CoreWeave. The business model is simple: they purchase GPUs from NVDA, install them in data centers, and lease them to customers for a fixed contract term that is typically 2-3 years. The GPUs typically pay for themselves during the initial lease term, leaving Applied Digital Cloud owning them free and clear at the end of the lease term for several more years of use. Applied takes very little risk here because at the time they purchase the GPUs there is already a contract in place for a full pay back of the equipment.

The NVDA investment is especially important for this segment because this is where NVDA can drive Applied’s future success. The hyperscalers are working on their own chips and are frienemies, so it is in NVDA’s long-term interest to ensure that there is a healthy ecosystem to support the consumption of their GPUs. They want companies like Applied and CoreWeave to prosper. NVDA can assure Applied’s success in a variety of ways by providing: (i) early allocations of the latest products; (ii) the best customer prospects who want to consume NVDA’s products as a service; and (iii) capital.

Consider what NVDA’s support did for CoreWeave. NVDA invested $100MM in CoreWeave in 2023 at a $2BN valuation. As of September 2024 CoreWeave was raising money at a $23BN valuation…. And look at where they are now. 

Valuing this segment is tricky because it is just getting started. If we assume it’s worth just 10% of CoreWeave, that’s $7BN. And it goes up from there. In the fullness of time, if Applied Digital Cloud prospers, then the company will spin this out as a separate company.   

**The High Level Setup**
Based on the recently announced data center lease with CoreWeave, it is clear that APLD is the real deal and has a chance to be a leader in the next gen data center buildout. BUT despite the recent surge in stock price, it has yet to go from zero to hero with the stock price still being vastly under valued.
 
Applied Digital will be the only pure play next-gen data center player in the public markets. There is no short thesis when NVDA and Related are anchor investors and a hyperscaler is a long-term partner and customer. APLD will fundamentally be worth a lot more than current prices, the stock should disconnect from any fundamental grounding as a result of being a public pureplay on the next AI bottleneck. The right tail asymmetry of this investment is under appreciated.  

**TLDR:** Company that used to mine magic internet money accidentally built a gold mine for AI. Now NVDA’s homies are renting it out, and the GPU gods might bless them with infinite tendies. Bags secured, brain not required

159,NVDA,"VOO etf vs ""safe"" + growth big cap stocks?","Hi guys, so I know this question was asked before. But I hope to hear your opinions on this. I know buying VOO etf and contribute every month is the key. However, I can't ignore the fact that there are some relatively safe mega cap companies with growth potential like NVDA, Amazon, Google. etc. As of now, my portfolio includes NVDA, amazon, google, Apple &amp; baba.

I did a quick calculation on compounding interest for VOO. In 5 years, with an average of 9% return (I am being conservative here), a $50k initial investment with no monthly contribution in VOO could be $76,931. So basically around 50% return after 5 years. If I put $1000 monthly contribution, the amount would be $148,747 after 5 years. This is almost triple.

Now mega caps like amazon, google, NVDA, a 50% increase in their market cap in 5 years is possible. But these companies are 2-3 trillions now. They will certain get bigger but 50% bigger is a lot and pretty sure they won't get triple in 5 years. Looking back 5 most recent years, SP500 has been up 94.58% while Amazon lags behind only 68.57%. Google did better at 139.82%. Apple is 153.9%. Microsoft is 152%. NVDA is a different monster at 1455%.

So now I start to regret my buying strategy. I should just buy VOO and make monthly contribution, and only keep smaller positions for these stock picks. Am I missing something here? is VOO's compound interest that powerful? is there any downside for investing in SP500 ?",0,13,1748933709.0,2025-06-03T06:55:09+00:00,t3_1l259sh,stocks

**Jobs Report Comes As Fed Faces Pressure on Interest Rates**  
The scheduled Friday release of the May U.S. jobs report will show whether the labor market continues to exhibit strength after employers added more jobs than analysts expected in April, as the unemployment rate remained at 4.2%.

Trump has been applying pressure on the Fed to cut interest rates from their current levels of 4.25% to 4.5%. Fed officials have said that they are in “wait-and-see” mode as the labor market remains strong and inflation comes under pressure from U.S. tariffs.

Earlier in the week, market watchers will get updates on job openings, private-sector payrolls, and weekly jobless claims.

Several Fed officials are scheduled to speak, including Federal Reserve Chair Powell, Dallas Fed President Logan, Chicago Fed President Goolsbee, and Philadelphia Fed President Harker. On Wednesday, the Fed’s Beige Book will provide more details on economic conditions throughout the country.

The Thursday scheduled report on the U.S. trade deficit comes as tariff threats have pushed shippers to increase imports ahead of the expected import taxes.

Investors will also be watching manufacturing and services industry surveys scheduled for release this week, as well as updated data on consumer credit levels, factory orders, and construction spending.

**Tech, Retail Earnings Reports in Focus**  
Chipmaker Broadcom’s scheduled financial report, due Thursday, comes on the heels of industry leader Nvidia’s (NVDA) report last week that showed continued demand for artificial intelligence (AI) products. Broadcom reported a 77% jump in its AI-related revenue in its most recent financial release as company executives forecast continued growth in that sector.

Cybersecurity company CrowdStrike Holdings is expected to release its earnings on Tuesday. The firm said in early May that it planned to cut 5% of its workforce. Guidewire Software, which provides services to insurance providers, is also expected to deliver an update on its AI products Tuesday.

Logistics software provider Descartes Systems Group is expected to release its earnings on Wednesday. Shippers continue to grapple with the impact of Trump's tariffs on the supply chain.

With consumer sentiment surveys showing increasing concerns over economic conditions, investors will be watching reports from retailers for signals on spending. Scheduled reports from Dollar General on Tuesday and Dollar Tree and Five Below on Wednesday will provide a look at consumer traffic at those stores. Campbell’s scheduled report on Monday will shine a light on food spending, while fashion brands Lululemon and Calvin Klein parent PVH also will be reporting.

168,NVDA,Week &amp; Month Recap: The week and month closed positively. Core PCE inflation decreased. This May was the best-performing May since 1990.,"First of all, I don't want to be misunderstood. This heat map is weekly that it reflects closing prices from May. 23 to May. 30. 

Today is the last day of the May and we've completed the week as well. So, we can discuss both of them in a single post. As mentioned in the title, May performed very good compare to long-term in May's. It was the most positive May since November 2023 with a gain of 8.92%. It also the best-performing May since 1990 with a gain of 9.19%.

Of course, these gains are closely linked to the performance in February and April, but the S&amp;P 500 showed a strong recovery after that. The stock market continues to focus on tariff concerns which caused some volatility depending on related news. Additionally, inflation data has supported this rally so far, but the Fed has not given any positive signals yet. They continue to mark tariffs and their potential impact.

Let's take a look at the weekly and monthly closing values, and then we'll continue with this week's events.

🔸 Tuesday: Monday was a holiday, so the stock market opened on Tuesday. Last Friday, Trump said that a deal with EU could not reached and prosed a 50% tariff starting June 1. Over the weekend, he extended the deadline to July 9. Thus, the stock market started higher more than 1%. This week also was several key economic data releases. Consumer Confidence acme at 98 and its the highest level in the past 3 months. Since June 2024, this data had not dropped below 100, but it began a streak after March. It boosted the market. The S&amp;P 500 closed more than 2% higher  and breaking 4-day losing streak. 🟢

🔸 Wednesday: The FOMC meeting minutes and $NVDA’s earnings results after the session were two key events. The stock market opened flat. In my opinion, FOMC meeting went as expected. They noted that the tariffs were larger and broader than expectations. The market didn't lose much and closed down by around 0.5%. 🔴

🔸 Thursday: After Wednesday's session, Nvidia released stronger than expected Q1 results. Before the market opened, Q1 GDP data came in slightly better than expectations. The forecast was -0.3%, but it came -0.2%. Also, the federal court blocked tariffs. However, weekly continuing jobless claims were released and reached 1,919K the highest level since October 2023. The stock market focused positive news and opened around 1% higher. As we know, tariffs are major concerns on the market. In the session, the stock market gave back some gains, but it still closed around 0.5% up. Lastly, U.S. trade team will visit India June 5-6. 🟢

🔸 Friday: Before the session, Fed's favorite economic indicator that Core PCE inflation was released. It came mounthly at 0.1% and decreased yearly from 2.6% to 2.5%. It's the lowest level since March 2021. However, Scott Bessent said trade talks between the U.S. and China have a bit stalled. As a result, the stock market opened slightly lower. During the session, The White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy said that Trump is preparing actions against China. The stock market reacted negatively at first, but later recovered and S&amp;P 500 closed down just 0.01%. 🔴

After PCE inflation data, the earliest predicted rate cut is September 2025. However, expectations for total number of cuts in this year decreased from 3 or 4 to 2. This is not a good sign for the stock market yet. On the other hand, tariffs remain the main concern and we've been hearing both positive and negative updates. The S&amp;P 500 has reached around 6,000 level and I believe it needs some strong positive news to break. What do you think? And how was your week?

161,NVDA,The case for $AMD.,"Three days after Trump warned everyone not to do business with Huawei, China started slow walking rare earth exports.  China has also demanded the US ease the AI chip restrictions on purchases of $AMD and $NVDA chips.

The US must have rare earths from China. It is not optional.  

Potus will be compelled to settle this dispute to restart Chinese rare earth exports, leaving the AI chip restrictions behind mostly, or at least permitting other less powerful chips to be exported to China.

$AMD has a forward PE of 19 for 2026 earnings.  While $NVDA has a scorcher of 31 forward PE for 2026.

Last year, I created a portfolio called “the Neckbeard Index 2”.

This portfolio contained a list of stocks that were stereotypical of Reddit neckbeards. The full list was:

* AMD
* AMZN
* DPZ
* GME
* HOOD
* LOGI
* MSFT
* NVDA
* RDDT

Unlike traditional investment wisdom which aims to invest based on fundamentals, **this portfolio was based solely on using archetypes of Reddit neckbeards.**

* AMD, Microsoft, Logitech, and NVIDIA were included because Redditors are stereotypically gamers.
* Robinhood was included because that’s their favorite investment app.
* Dominos was included because they’re stereotypically overweight.
* Obviously Reddit itself.

372,NVDA,Quantum Scamming Inc: The Big Short Nobody Saw Coming,"Morning fellas, I'm back after more than three years to bring you my highest conviction idea ever. I'm talking 90%+ downside.

**TL;DR:** Quantum computing stocks are the next great meme bubble — a flaming clown car of hype, government grants, and zero actual business. Companies like $QBTS, $IONQ, $RGTI, and especially $QUBT (which literally used to sell flavored beverages) are pretending to be tech plays while burning through cash with nothing to show for it. Even if quantum computing becomes real, Google and IBM already won the arms race. Experts say useful quantum is still 20–30 years away — not 3. This is *The Big Short 2: Quantum Boogaloo*. I’m shorting these frauds before they drop another 90%. Strap in.

**Introduction:**

Quantum stocks ripped aggressively since the beginning of the year, after the announcement of Willow, Google's new quantum processor. First of all, Google didn't even come up with anything groundbreaking. Ironically, this also highlights how far ahead Google is from the competition. Even worse, some of the stocks below don't even make quantum computers at all.

Quantum computing is 20-30y+ away, if at all. Yet the stocks trade like they cured cancer yesterday. This is honestly a lot worse than Nikola and EV stocks for those who were there back then. They are totally misunderstood by retail, and some of them literaly have 90%+ downside.

**Quantum Computing Basics:**

Quantum computing isn't a better computer. It's a compeltely different paradigm that is only useful to solve very specific and esoteric problems. Like factoring big prime numbers (even that doesn't even work yet) or doing weird matrix math *only under certain condtions.*

To run these algorithms, you don't need just a couple qubits, you need error corrected logical qubits, which take *thousands* of physicals qubits. We're barely

One of the biggest issues with quantum computeers is gate fidelity. This measures how a quantum gate actually performs its intended operation compared to an ideal, noise-free version of that gate. Today, even the best systems get around 99.9% fiedlity under perfect lab conditions. This sounds high, but due to the exponential scaling of quantum algorithms, erors compoound extremely quickly and at 99.9% they are literaly useless. Quantum algos need billions of error free operations and we're nowhere closes. For comparisons, classical computers have gate fidelity of between 10^(-15) and 10^(-18). Thats eighteen 9s after 99, or 99.99999999999999999%. Its not that quantum computers are behind classical computers - *they're basically unusable*

**Industry Experts**

Why should you believe me when I say quantum computing doens't work? After all I'm just a muppet. If you don't take my word for it, listen to the leading industry experts, that spend their days working on it.

Scott Aaronson (Professor, UT Austin, top quanutm complexity theorist):  
""We're nowhere near large-scale quantum computers. The real applications are speculative and still a long way off""

Jensen Huang (CEO, NVIDIA):  
""Quantum computing is decades away. It will not replace classical computing. It's a different tool for very specific problems.""

Dr. Isaac Chuang (MIT, pionner in quantum information):  
""Quantum computers are not yet practical, and may not be for a long time. The barriers are fundamental""

Even if all these people are wrong, Google and IBM are so far ahead, that they'll be the clear winners.

**The Trade:**

The most overvalued and ridiculous names are: $QUBT, $QBTS, $IONQ, $RGTI. I'm short only the first two. They're all ridiculous, but at least IONQ and Rigetti have somewhat of a product.

$QUBT: This is literaly a scam, they've got very little to do with Quantum. These guys were literaly a beverage company. They don't build quantum computers. They sell vague ""quantum inspired"" software with 0 commerical traction. They claim to be ""hardware-agnostic"", which literaly reads ""we don't have a machine"". Imagine being a quantum computing stock with no computer. Revenue in 23 was $100k, not millions, $100k. This is not even a real business, just a vehicule made to earn a quick buck. Their software doens't even require a qaumtum processor to run, it's just classical code with buzzwords. This is my highest conviction short.

$QBTS: These guys make quantum annealers, not even a real quantum computer. They've een in business for 25 years, and only make $9m in revenue, with a market cap of $4.7bn. They were on the brink of bankruptcy, trading for $1, with no cash left. Then the Willow anouncement came and they manage to issue some stock and get some cash back. As a reminder, Willow has nothing to do with QBTS, this will end going back to 0 after the hype subsides.

Q1 data center business carries the flag, demand remains strong, the second half of the year may usher in a","After the U.S. stock market session on Wednesday, May 28, EST, artificial intelligence (AI) general leader $ NVIDIA (NVDA.US)$ released financials for the company's first fiscal quarter of FY2026 ending April 27, 2025, as well as earnings guidance for the second fiscal quarter of FY2026. The results were better than expected overall, despite pressure from U.S. government export restrictions. Shares of NVIDIA are up over 6% at today's U.S. stock open.

Overall, NVIDIA Q1 operating income of $44.1 billion, a year-on-year growth of 69%, exceeding analysts' expectations of $43.309 billion, NVIDIA's own guidance of $42.14 billion to $43.86 billion, the previous quarter grew 78% year-on-year. NVIDIA revenue year-on-year growth rate, the lowest single-quarter growth rate in two years, but still stronger than analysts expected growth rate of 66%.

Earnings, Q1 NVIDIA H20 chip export restrictions on NVIDIA had a significant impact. NVIDIA adjusted EPS growth of 33% year-on-year, less than half of the previous quarter's 71% growth rate, $ 0.81 EPS is lower than analysts' expectations of nearly 13%. However, if you exclude the impact of H20 expenses, EPS rebounded to $0.96, also more than 3% higher than analysts' expectations of $0.93.

Gross margins changed similarly, with Q1 adjusted gross margin at 61%, down 17.9 percentage points year-on-year and well below analysts' expectations of 71%. And excluding the impact of H20 gross margin was 71.3%, roughly in line with analyst expectations and NVIDIA's own guidance.

More worring : arista network. Very good company, good earning, and leader in the sector or data center networking. But the price has stopped going up for some weeks unlike other data center tech companies. And today, we are losing 6.5% !!! Is there some bad news ? or just people are tired of arista ? 

It's very strange : Nvidia announced data center market is on fire. In France and UAE, massive investments have been announced. But Arista is in very trouble period without reason :(

The small $ 1 Bn beat for Q1 results was impressive considering the $ 2.5 Bn in lost H-20 sales to China, but even more astounding was the reaffirmed guidance of $ 45 Bn for Q2, **in spite of $8 Bn in H-20 lost sales in Q2.** One can imagine where the stock would have skyrocketed if guidance had come in at $ 53 Bn instead of $ 45 Bn!

**Trying to thread the needle and trade Nvidia is missing the woods for the trees.** 

**Inferencing demand is a major revenue catalyst for Nvidia over the next several years, as evidenced by the significant increase in tokenization. Similarly, seen is Agentic AI demand, which is a revenue-bearing product of reasoning and inference, and will continue to grow.**

This was Jensen Huang on the conference call today on inference demand.

&gt;“Well, we would like to serve all of it, and I think we're on track to serve most of it. Grace Blackwell NVLink72 is the ideal engine today, the ideal computer thinking machine, if you will, for reasoning AI. There's a couple of reasons for that. The first reason is that the token generation amount, the number of tokens reasoning goes through, is 100 times, 1,000 times more than a one-shot chatbot. It's essentially thinking to itself, breaking down a problem step-by-step. It might be planning multiple paths to an answer. It could be using tools, reading PDFs, reading web pages, watching videos, and then producing a result, an answer. The longer it thinks, the better the answer, the smarter the answer is. And so, what we would like to do, and the reason why Grace Blackwell was designed to give such a giant step-up in inference performance, is so that you could do all this and still get a response as quickly as possible. Compared to Hopper, Grace Blackwell is some 40 times higher speed and throughput compared. And so, this is going to be a huge, huge benefit in driving down the cost while improving the quality of response with excellent quality of service at the same time.”

**One-year product cadence:** Nvidia has been very proactive when it comes to its product line-up, and showed off an ambitious slate of coming products at its [annual GTC conference](https://www.wsj.com/finance/stocks/nvidias-big-show-hits-its-marks-but-plays-to-tough-crowd-35462acb?mod=article_inline) in March, including updated versions of its Blackwell chips that are in particularly high demand by companies trying to build up state-of-the-art AI networks. 

[According to the Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/business/earnings/nvidia-nvda-q1-earnings-report-2025-62ff6a10?mod=hp_lead_pos4), analysts expect the Blackwell lineup alone to generate nearly $98 billion in sales in the current fiscal year ending in January and a further $119 billion next year.

And Blackwell contributed about 70% of datacenter sales in Q1-26, successfully transitioning from the Hopper series

**I suspect that the $200 Bn revenue number for FY 2026 will be short, and with all the sovereign and other AI demand, it might even be exceeded, even without Chinese sales, with GPU cluster investment announcements from sovereign AI and Oracle and xAi, easily making up for the lost sales.**

Accelerated computing is the new paradigm, and I can see Nvidia dominating in every sphere of accelerated computing. 

From Jensen Huang on the Nvidia earnings call. 

&gt;“So, that's the fundamental reason. That was the core driving reason for Grace Blackwell NVLink72. Of course, in order to do that, we had to reinvent, literally redesign the entire way that these supercomputers are built, and -- but now we're in full production. It's going to be exciting. It's going to be incredibly exciting. And so, computing is one stack, one part of it. But remember, enterprise IT is really three pillars; it's compute, storage, and networking. And we've now put all three of them together finally, and we're going to market with that.""



Cloud computing was just the start; these will follow. 

**On-Premise Computing and PCS** – Nvidia has already announced new products –  RTX Pro Enterprise AI server that runs everything On-Prem. DGX Spark and DGX Station, which are going to replace “traditional” CPU-run PCs, are designed for developers who want to work on-prem.

**Enterprise AI** is still a very nascent market and could be huge for Nvidia. A computing system that can integrate and run enterprise AI stacks, run enterprise IT stacks, but add AI to them. The Networking platform business using NVLink is available for competitors to make advanced GPU clusters.

**Physical and Industrial AI** – through the Omniverse and robotics: 

Jensen Huang on the earnings call:

&gt; “And then lastly, industrial AI. Remember, one of the implications of the world reordering, if you will, is a region's onshoring manufacturing and building plants everywhere. In addition to AI factories, of course, there are new electronics manufacturing, chip manufacturing being built around the world. And all of these new plants and these new factories are creating exactly the right time when Omniverse and AI and all the work that we're doing with robotics is emerging. And so, this fourth pillar is quite important.""



Every factory will have an AI factory associated with it. And in order to create these physical AI systems, you really have to train a vast amount of data. So, back to more data, more training, more AIs to be created, more computers. And so, these four drivers are really kicking into turbocharge.”

**NeoClouds** – Small business AI rentals through NeoClouds, like Coreweave and Nebius, should be a huge business. 

Lost in all this was Gaming revenue, which grew 42% to $3.76 billion, 33% above analysts’ forecasts! $ 1 Bn beat on $2.78 estimate – that is extremely impressive and attributed to Blackwell’s product strengths. Auto was another gainer, jumping to $567Mn up 72% YoY.

**I believe we’re in just the 2nd innings of a 9 innings AI revolution, and my 3-year target for Nvidia is $250, and I’ll continue to add on declines.**",0,2,1748524491.0,2025-05-29T13:14:51+00:00,t3_1kyai1a,stocks

166,NVDA,Nvidia's Long-Term Prospects Remain Terrific - I'm going to ignore Q1-earnings noise.,"Nvidia (NVDA) $135 Pre earnings

Nvidia’s Q1-FY2026 results may be noisy, but I’m not hedging it; I own shares, remain long-term bullish and will ignore earnings volatility, and may even add more.

Institutional or other investors who emphasize Blackwell absorbing H20 losses (About $13 Bn in lost annual sales and $5.5Bn in chargebacks for unsold inventory-due to the government ban on H20 exports to China) may be trying to thread the needle, **either believing that the markets will not be happy with the Blackwell ramp or the speed of the ramp to mitigate these lost sales. But for a company that is firing on so many cylinders, I’m sanguine about the Q1-FY2026 results, and am absolutely positive about the long-term prospects – it’s business as usual for the best of the best. This is a once-in-a-lifetime** opportunity, and for once it’s not a cliche.

The momentum around inferencing, and the computing power needs for inferencing and reasoning models suggest that Nvidia’s is a supply problem – and even if the $ 200 Bn revenue estimate for FY Jan 2026 is off by a small percent, FY 2027 to FY 2030, will more than make up for it. 

Morgan Stanley’s Joseph Moore, who has an Overweight rating and $160 price target on Nvidia, said the Jensen Huang-led company is likely to be fine if it can show investors that rack supply has accelerated.

**“Our data points would suggest that in recent weeks, the full year rack forecasts have started to be revised upwards by 50 %+,” Moore added, citing recent channel checks that suggest the issues have been resolved and are now starting to show up in numbers.**

**Additionally, investors appear to be underestimating the “unprecedented explosive token growth” commentary coming from Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG) (GOOGL), Moore posited.**

**“Every hyperscaler has reported unanticipated strong token growth,” Moore explained. “But our conviction is not driven by that, it’s driven by the fact that literally everyone we talk to in the space is telling us that they have been surprised by inference demand, and there is a scramble to add GPUs.”**

Moore continued: “This is not driven by the limitless aspirations for training megaclusters fueled by highly speculative venture capitalists; **this is proof that the models are being used, and driving revenue,** which mitigates the biggest overhang on NVIDIA stock that this is all driven by venture funding that will dry up. **The strength we highlight here is driven by usage, by the revenue-generating part of the business, and provides proof points that the scaling of inference as we move to reasoning-oriented models is a real thing.** We are seeing this spanning geographies, as well, so published concerns about China having stockpiled H20s seem inaccurate.”

**I think Nvidia will have a similar overwhelming market share and growth in inference GPUs and their 1 year product roadmap ensures that they remain ahead of the competition– this is just the beginning.**",24,19,1748397619.0,2025-05-28T02:00:19+00:00,t3_1kx5azw,stocks

382,NVDA,NVIDIA Artificial Intelligence,"Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA)) has outperformed every stock in the S&amp;P 500 ([\^GSPC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC)) since [the launch of ChatGPT ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/how-chatgpt-changed-the-world-of-tech-in-just-one-year-180957543.html)in late November 2022 Shares in the chipmaker have risen nearly 700% since ChatGPT brought the power of artificial intelligence to the masses, far outpacing the S&amp;P 500's roughly 45% over the same time period. The next closest gain for an S&amp;P 500 company in that time period is a 540% pop for Vistra Corp ([VST](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VST)).Nvidia has established itself as the key provider of chips needed to operate AI systems. Now at the epicenter of an AI arms race, Nvidia has established itself as[ a cornerstone of the recent bull market](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/live/stock-market-today-tech-leads-stocks-higher-as-nvidia-surges-to-record-high-175727614.html) in stocks as the company's sales and profits have skyrocketed over the past several years.

Ahead of the [company's next quarterly earnings release on May 28](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-to-report-q1-earnings-as-middle-east-deals-export-control-reprieve-boost-stock-122728218.html), we broke down some of the most eye-popping charts that show how Nvidia became one of the most-followed stocks in the market.There's perhaps no clearer way to see how Nvidia ran away from the competition in the AI boom than looking at the company's market capitalization against its peers. Back when ChatGPT launched, Nvidia had a market cap of just over $400 billion. It's now over $3.3 trillion. Over that same time period, chip competitor Intel's ([INTC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/INTC)) market cap has actually decreased, while Advanced Micro Devices' ([AMD](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMD)) market cap has increased incrementally from $125 billion to $177 billion.Nvidia's rise proved to be at the center of a new technological boom. Combined with Nvidia, the rise in dominance of six other companies — Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)), Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL), [GOOG](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG)), Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)), Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)), Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)), and Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)) — formed what would come to be known as the [""Magnificent Seven.""](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/one-chart-shows-how-the-magnificent-7-have-dominated-the-stock-market-in-2023-203250125.html)

The group began the AI boom with a combined market cap just shy of $7 billion. Now, two and a half years later, the Big Tech group's market cap is worth over $16.8 trillion. The seven companies have grown from about 22% of the S&amp;P 500's market cap in November 2022 to 32% of the index's market cap today.Given the outsized weighting in the S&amp;P 500, large swings in shares of Nvidia have become a feature of how even broad market investors are thinking about the direction of stocks. In June 2024,[ three Wall Street strategists boosted their year-end S&amp;P 500 targets](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-enthusiasm-prompts-3-wall-street-banks-to-raise-stock-market-forecasts-100027154.html), citing better-than-expected consistent performance among key AI players.

As of May 19, the Magnificent Seven have accounted for about 52% of the S&amp;P 500's gain since Nov. 30, 2022. Nvidia alone has contributed 17.21%, by far the most among the group, with the next closest stock, Microsoft, which has added about 8.8%.Nvidia's stock hasn't been rising from just hype. The company's quarterly financial metrics have soared. In the quarter ChatGPT launched, Nvidia posted revenue of $6.3 billion. Two years later, it would post revenue of $35.3 billion. That's a 460% increase in sales in two years. As seen in the chart below, the main source of growth for Nvidia has been its data center revenue segment, which includes the sales of its AI chips.

From the company's fourth quarter of 2023 to its final quarter of its 2025 reporting period, data center revenue grew almost 900%.

Nvidia's data center revenue particularly stands out when considering its rise against peers in the industry. In the final quarter of 2024, Nvidia notched a record $35.58 billion in just data center revenue, up from $3.62 billion in the final quarter of 2022.

In comparison, Alphabet's data center revenue increased to $11.96 billion, ending 2024 up from $7.32 billion in the final quarter of 2022.

I'm French and I keep a close eye on the European markets, particularly to take advantage of the tax benefits we French investors enjoy when investing in them. And today, I don’t know if you’ve heard, but some European stocks are currently experiencing explosive growth:

We can also mention **Leonardo** or **Hensoldt**. Indeed, there’s not only Germany’s €1 trillion defense plan, but also the European Union’s €800 billion investment plan. Among that, a €150 billion package was just approved. And beyond these pure defense players, there are also more generalist companies that are heavily exposed to the defense sector through their activities.
* On the other hand, **small-cap stocks** are also on the rise. Several small caps are landing major contracts that are expected to double or even quintuple their revenues thanks to these investments. Why? Because they produce essential components or services that are in high demand in the defense sector. Moreover, the European plan emphasizes the involvement of small caps to benefit from the funding.

I personally hold stocks that have gained over **+40% in a single week** following the approval of the €150 billion plan, and the trend is still upward.

177,NVDA,Oracle to spend $40 billion on Nvidia chips for OpenAI data center - FT,"Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) plans to invest approximately $40 billion in high-performance chips from NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) to power OpenAI’s new AI-focused data center in Texas, according to a report from The Financial Times. The move underscores the accelerating arms race among tech giants to secure the infrastructure needed to support next-generation artificial intelligence models.

The facility, located in Abilene, Texas, is part of a $500 billion initiative led by OpenAI and SoftBank Group. As the first Stargate U.S. site, the data center is expected to support 1.2 gigawatts of computing power when fully operational by mid-2026.

Oracle intends to acquire roughly 400,000 of Nvidia’s GB200 chips, the company’s most advanced processors for AI training and inference. Rather than operate the center directly, Oracle will lease the computing capacity to OpenAI under a reported 15-year agreement.

The Texas site will be among the world’s largest when completed, solidifying both Oracle’s and OpenAI’s ambitions in large-scale infrastructure.

The announcement follows a separate collaboration unveiled this week between the three companies, alongside G42, SoftBank Group Corp. (TYO:9984), and Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO), to build Stargate UAE, a 1-gigawatt AI cluster headquartered in Abu Dhabi. The UAE facility will be housed within the larger UAE–U.S. AI Campus and is designed to support global-scale AI advancement across industries.

As chip demand surges, Oracle’s multi-year investment signals confidence not only in Nvidia’s hardware but also in OpenAI’s ability to lead the next era of compute-intensive applications. “AI is the most transformative force of our time,” said Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang earlier this week. “With Stargate, we are building the infrastructure to power the future.""",86,20,1748211439.0,2025-05-25T22:17:19+00:00,t3_1kven6n,StockMarket
178,NVDA,Nvidia earnings most likely scenario,"Nvidia announces earnings on Wednesday AH. I’ve seen that most people are selling calls or buying puts based on the options flow. So the general sentiment is bearish but IV is high. 

I myself have a call that expires 6/6. 

I think nvidia goes to around 137-140 range on tuesday, if it does, I’ll sell my call for a small profit, if not, I’ll wait till Wednesday during market hours to decide.

But IV crush is the most likely scenario to happen, and if it does happen, then I’ll wait till Friday or Monday and then buy some 150 or 170 late july calls.

I’m not an expert, just posting my opinion here. Lmk your predictions!

Edit: I sold my call at open for 25% gain, I thought I would be losing but high IV saved me haha",90,48,1748191301.0,2025-05-25T16:41:41+00:00,t3_1kv6xxm,SmallStreetBets
169,NVDA,"Nvidia earnings Trump tariff updates, and the Fed's preferred inflation gauge: What to know this week","Stocks' feverish rebound over the past month is now on pause as growing concerns about the fiscal deficit have sent Treasury yields roaring higher and President Trump is once again threatening to escalate tariffs.



On Friday, Trump threatened to place a direct 25% tariff on Apple products not made in the US while also warning he'd ramp up duties on the European Union to 50% at the start of June. This solidified a week of decline for stocks as the Nasdaq Composite (\^IXIC) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (\^DJI) dropped about 2.4%. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 (\^GSPC) slid roughly 2.6% on the week.



In the week ahead, updates on the trade war and Trump's pending tax bill will remain in focus, while quarterly results from Nvidia (NVDA) are expected to take center stage on Wednesday after the market close. Reports from Okta (OKTA), Salesforce (CRM), and Costco (COST) will also receive investor attention.



The release of the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge on Friday will headline the economic data schedule. Markets will be closed on Monday for Memorial Day.



Tariff escalation

President Trump's policies have continued to drive markets. Concerns over Trump's tax bill boosting the government deficit have pushed Treasury yields higher. At over 5.1%, the 30-year Treasury yield (\^TYX) had been hovering near its highest level since 2007, while the 10-year Treasury yield (\^TNX) had pressed above 4.6%, its highest level since February.



But the sell-off in bonds eased on Friday as Trump once again threatened to escalate tariffs, sending a reminder to investors that even with a 90-day tariff pause on a wide swath of countries, the trade policy whipsaw in markets is far from over.



""Safe to say for the time being we’ve hit 'trough' trade uncertainty,"" Piper Sandler chief investment strategist Michael Kantrowitz wrote in a note to clients on Friday. ""At this point markets need to see these tariffs retracted AND bond yields to not spike again for any material move higher.""



Friday's decline in treasuries sent the 10-year below the key 4.5% level Kantrowitz has been watching. As Kantrowitz highlights in the chart below, once the 10-year Treasury yield has risen above 4.5%, interest rate-sensitive stocks have seen increased underperformance in recent years.



This played out in last week's market action with the Russell 2000 Index (\^RUT), which has many companies with more interest rate exposure than the S&amp;P 500, falling nearly 4% compared to the S&amp;P 500's 2.6% decline.



The AI leader reports

Nvidia is set to report quarterly results on Wednesday after the market close. Investors will be closely watching for any updates on demand from the leading supplier of AI chips. For the quarter, Nvidia is expected to report adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.88 on revenue of $43.3 billion, according to Bloomberg analyst consensus data. The company reported adjusted EPS of $0.61 on revenue of $26 billion in the same period last year.



Given Nvidia's position as one of the top holdings in the S&amp;P 500, investors will also be watching how the report affects other tech stocks and the broader market. Shares of Nvidia are roughly flat this year after whipsawing amid growing fears of AI competition and tariff concerns.



Since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, Nvidia alone has accounted for about 17% of the S&amp;P 500's gains.



Price check

Tariffs have increased fears that inflation could spike again. But there's been little evidence of a resurgence thus far in economic data, and economists expect a similar story to play out in the coming week.



A fresh look at a key inflation measure will come on Friday with the April PCE release. Economists project annual ""core"" PCE — which excludes the volatile categories of food and energy — to have clocked in at 2.5% in April, down from the 2.6% seen in March. Over the prior month, economists project ""core"" PCE at 0.1%, above the 0% seen the month prior.",95,45,1748185011.0,2025-05-25T14:56:51+00:00,t3_1kv4ikx,stocks

**Nvidia Earnings Highlight Slate of Tech, Retail, Financial Reports This Week**

Nvidia is scheduled to report its quarterly earnings on Wednesday. The chipmaking giant recently returned to the $3 trillion market-capitalization level after its share price rallied by around 50% from its April low. The earnings report follows the company’s announcement that it will supply semiconductors to Saudi Arabian AI startup Humain. Nvidia reported 78% year-over-year revenue growth in its prior earnings release. Semiconductor firm Marvell Technology is also scheduled to report this week.

Salesforce’s expected report on Wednesday comes after the cloud software provider reported 8% revenue growth in its prior quarter on the growth of its Agentforce custom AI platform. While the firm delivered a worse-than-expected outlook, analysts said the company had strong potential for growth.

Thursday’s scheduled report from Dell Technologies will show whether the computer maker continues to benefit from increased demand for AI infrastructure after it grew server and networking sales by 37% in the prior quarter. Morgan Stanley recently raised its price target for the company, citing growing server sales momentum on AI demand. Market watchers will also be following computer equipment maker HP’s scheduled report on Wednesday.

Costco Wholesale is on Thursday’s corporate calendar, coming as the membership-based retailer reported that its April sales rose by 7%, which analysts attributed partly to customers rushing purchases ahead of U.S. tariffs. Costco reported a 9% revenue growth in its prior quarter on increased revenue from higher membership fees.

AutoZone’s scheduled report on Tuesday follows an upgrade from Bank of America Securities as analysts argued that higher auto costs from U.S. tariffs could lead to more vehicle repairs by cost-conscious drivers. Dick’s Sporting Goods’ expected report on Wednesday follows its recent deal to acquire sporting goods retailer Foot Locker (FL).

Investors will be watching the scheduled Thursday report from Chinese EV Li Auto, which competes with Tesla (TSLA) sales in that nation. The Tuesday report from PDD Holdings comes as the parent of Chinese-based online retailer Temu faces pressure from U.S. tariffs.

Inflation, GDP, Fed Speakers in Focus

Friday’s scheduled release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index will show how the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation fared in April. A similar inflation reading showed that price increases cooled somewhat in April, and the Fed has said it is closely watching prices in the wake of Trump’s tariffs.

Wednesday’s expected release of the minutes of the May meeting of the FOMC will provide more insight into Fed officials’ deliberations over interest rates and the economy. Likewise, several Fed officials are scheduled to speak during the week, including Fed Gov. Waller, New York Fed President Williams, and San Francisco Fed President Daly.

Revisions to first-quarter GDP are expected on Thursday after the initial report last month showed that the economy shrank in the first three months of 2025.

The state of the consumer will also be in focus for investors, with reports on consumer confidence and consumer sentiment scheduled to be released this week. The reports come as recent surveys show that consumers’ moods have soured over concerns that tariffs will drive prices higher. Friday’s expected reports on the U.S. trade deficit, retail inventories, and wholesale inventories will provide more detail on how U.S. tariffs are affecting the economy. ",67,3,1748178984.0,2025-05-25T13:16:24+00:00,t3_1kv2as8,stocks

Midweek, the main focus was 30-year Treasury yield. By the end of the week, Trump took center stage with a proposal for 50% tariff on European Union starting June 1. While Scott Bessent provided some optimism, Fed's Goolsbee added a dose of negative. Let's take a look at the current positions.

Day-by-Day Standouts;

🔸 Monday: Last week ended very well with the S&amp;P 500 gained more than 5%. This week started with downgrade of the U.S. credit rating by Moody's and causing indexes open more than 1% lower. Despite the initial panic, markets recovered during the session and closed slightly higher. 🟢

🔸 Tuesday: After a strong recovery on Monday, the indexes opened flat on Tuesday. The market began to focus on the 30-year Treasury yield. It was a quiet session and the S&amp;P 500 closed slightly lower. Meanwhile, investors turned to gold as a safe haven and pushing price up around 2% to $3,300. 🔴

🔸 Wednesday: Before the session, CNN reported that Israel may attack Iran's nuclear facilities. Gold prices rose again and passed $3,300. The stock market opened lower around 0.5% due to both 30-year Treasury yield and Israel attack. During the session, 30-year Treasury yield continued upper trend and back above 5.05%. It's highest level since October 2023. The stock market closed lower more than 1.5%. This is also the worst close so far in May. 🔴

🔸 Thursday: After 2-day losing streak, the stock market opened flat. The 30-year Treasury yield hit 5.15% before easing. The House of Representatives passed Trump’s tax and spending bill. As a result, the S&amp;P 500 closed slightly negative and down just 0.04% while the Nasdaq finished higher. 🔴

🔸 Friday: Yesterday was a busy day. Before the session, Trump proposed a 50% tariff on European Union starting June 1. The future market reacted immediately and dropping more than 1%. He also stated that Apple should move production to the U.S. and he can add 25% tariff on them. The stock market opened lower more than 1%. During the session, Scott Bessent offered some optimism. He said several large trade deals will be announced in the next couple of weeks and the U.S. will resume in-person negotiations with China. This helped the market recover slightly, but the S&amp;P 500 still closed lower more than 0.5% and extending losing streak to 4-day. Additionally, Fed's Goolsbee said that rate cuts are still possible in next 10-16 months due to uncertainty in trade policy. As of now, the stock market expects the earlist in September. 🔴

Trump has remained silent on tariffs for a week and the stock market has been trending upward. On April 7, the S&amp;P 500 hit the lowest level at 4,835.04 and then it had climbed at 5,968.61 on May 19. It gained over 20% in just a month. Despite recent volatility, the stock market hasn't dropped significantly. Could this mean it's still looking to forward? What do you think? And how was your week?

What Happened?

Shares of quantum computing company IonQ (NYSE:IONQ) jumped 36.3% in the afternoon session after renewed enthusiasm for quantum computing following the sharp pullback in the first quarter of the year.

While specific news for the day wasn't immediately apparent to have caused a major surge, the company has had a series of positive announcements, including strong Q1 2025 earnings that beat analyst estimates.

Earlier in the week, the company announced a collaboration with Swedish company Einride to develop quantum solutions for fleet routing, logistics optimization, and supply chain solutions. This would also extend to Einride's autonomous and electric fleet operations worldwide, two of the fast evolving tech markets, which hold a lot of opportunities and growth potential.

Adding to the optimism, the company's CEO reiterated its ambitious mission to become the 'Nvidia of quantum computing' in an interview with Barron's.

The shares closed the day at $45.88, up 36.9% from previous close.

What The Market Is Telling Us

IonQ’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 105 moves greater than 5% over the last year. But moves this big are rare even for IonQ and indicate this news significantly impacted the market’s perception of the business.

The previous big move we wrote about was about 1 month ago when the stock gained 7.9% on the news that investor sentiment improved on renewed optimism that the US-China trade conflict might be nearing a resolution. According to reports, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reinforced this positive outlook by describing the trade war as ""unsustainable,"" and emphasized that a potential agreement between the two economic powers ""was possible.""

IonQ is up 4.4% since the beginning of the year, but at $45.01 per share, it is still trading 11.9% below its 52-week high of $51.07 from January 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of IonQ’s shares at the IPO in January 2021 would now be looking at an investment worth $4,168.

Today’s young investors likely haven’t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future.

(Bloomberg) — The Trump administration will maintain efforts to keep advanced artificial intelligence technology out of China’s hands, a top White House official said, brushing off calls from Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang to ease restrictions on chip exports to the world’s second largest economy.

“We obviously have huge respect for Jensen,” Sriram Krishnan, White House senior policy adviser for artificial intelligence, said in a Bloomberg Television interview Wednesday. “When it comes to inside China, I do think there is still bipartisan and broad concern about what can happen to these GPUs once they’re physically inside” the country, he added.

While the Trump administration still sees a security risk from widening AI chip exports to China, Krishnan said it agrees with Huang’s view that restrictions on a wide range of other US trading partners need to be revisited. The Trump administration is rescinding and moving to replace the Biden-era AI diffusion rule that Krishnan said created “GPU haves and GPU have nots.”

“When it comes to the rest of the world, we want American AI stack starting from the GPUs to the models to everything on top,” Krishnan said. “On that, Jensen and I and us are in agreement.”

Krishnan spoke hours after Huang made his most forceful public comments to date against escalating US export restrictions aimed at China. Speaking at the Computex industry conference in Taipei, Huang blasted the measures as a “failure” and urged the US to lower barriers to chip sales in China before American firms cede the market to rivals such as Huawei Technologies Co.

Huang told reporters that China will account for a $50 billion opportunity in 2026. “China has 50% of the world’s AI developers, and it’s important that when they develop on an architecture, they develop on Nvidia, or at least American technology,” he said. Nvidia recently wrote off $5.5 billion in H20 AI chips that had been designed to comply with previous export curbs, but were targeted by a new round of restrictions from the Trump administration this year.

Krishnan pointed to the flurry of projects in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates announced by American companies during President Donald Trump’s trip to the Middle East last week as evidence of a new effort to ease US allies’ access to AI. He stressed that the agreements would still contain security restrictions to prevent the illegal transfer of advanced technology to China and other adversaries.

“These deals and these GPUs are predominantly going to be run by American hyperscalers, American cloud service providers and American companies,” said Krishnan, who was a general partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz prior to joining the White House. “Most of these GPUs are going to be run, hosted, controlled by American companies.”",67,50,1747855124.0,2025-05-21T19:18:44+00:00,t3_1ks6hod,wallstreetbets

174,NVDA,"NVDA expects $15B loss in revenue due to ""deeply painful"" H20 Bans","Source: [https://www.barrons.com/articles/nvidia-stock-china-ai-d2cb34ee](https://www.barrons.com/articles/nvidia-stock-china-ai-d2cb34ee)

  
Nvidia CEO Jensen Haung has quantified the revenue impact of the U.S. government’s latest move to limit chip exports to China: $15 billion.



Last month, the administration effectively banned Nvidia’s H20 chips to China by tightening chip export licensing requirements to the Asian country. At the time, Nvidia said it expected to take a $5.5 billion charge related to inventory and purchase commitments from the new restrictions for its fiscal first quarter.

“This additional ban on Nvidia’s H20 is deeply painful,” Huang said in a Stratechery interview published on Monday. “We walked away from $15 billion of sales and probably—what is it? — $3 billion worth of taxes” for the U.S.

Critics have said offering Nvidia’s artificial-intelligence chips to China—even one or two generations old—can help companies in China catch up to the U.S. in AI technology. Huang disagrees. He believes the restrictions are shortsighted and will, in reality, help China in the long run.

A morning briefing on what you need to know in the day ahead, including exclusive commentary from Barron's and MarketWatch writers.

The restrictions opens the market in China for increased usage of Huawei’s AI chips, he said. If more companies use Huawei’s chips and the Chinese company can refine its software, Nvidia’s current CUDA software advantage could erode.

“Anybody who thought that one chess move to somehow ban China from H20s would somehow cut off their ability to do AI is deeply uninformed,” Huang said. “If we don’t compete in China, and we allow the Chinese ecosystem to build a rich ecosystem because we’re not there to compete for it, and new platforms are developed and they’re not American at a time when the world is diffusing AI technology, their leadership and their technology will diffuse all around the world.”

The executive also argues by limiting access to Nvidia’s products it forces companies to provide financial resources to Huawei, which the company will then use for R&amp;D to compete with Nvidia.",579,61,1747685129.0,2025-05-19T20:05:29+00:00,t3_1kqloim,stocks
183,NVDA,Nvidia CEO: China chip ban 'deeply painful' as $15 billion in sales have been lost as a result,"No paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-ceo-china-chip-ban-deeply-painful-as-15-billion-in-sales-have-been-lost-as-a-result-162124142.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-ceo-china-chip-ban-deeply-painful-as-15-billion-in-sales-have-been-lost-as-a-result-162124142.html)

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, at the Computex trade show in Taipei on Monday, said the Trump administration's ban on its H20 chips for China has cost the company $15 billion in sales.

During an interview with technology analyst Ben Thompson, Huang called the ban ""enormously costly"" and ""deeply painful."" He pointed to the $5.5 billion in charges the company expects to see in its first fiscal quarter due to the ban.

""No company in history has ever written off that much inventory,"" he said. ""\[N\]ot only am I losing $5.5 billion — we wrote off $5.5 billion — we walked away from $15 billion of sales and probably ... $3 billion worth of taxes.""

Wall Street analysts had projected that Nvidia could see anywhere between a $10 billion and $16 billion hit to revenue over the coming quarters from the most recent export ban on its H20 chips.

Nvidia has repeatedly updated its chips for the Chinese market in the past several years to comply with ever-tightening US trade restrictions, making the chips less and less powerful with each new iteration.

The latest ban on exports of its chips last month came just as the US government said it was investigating Nvidia over the use of its AI chips in China. It cited the release of a cheap AI model from Chinese startup DeepSeek powered by Nvidia's prior-generation H800s, which are currently banned from export to the country.

Huang implied Nvidia can't make another AI chip with its Hopper architecture for China under the current restrictions: ""\[T\]hat’s the limit of what we can do to Hopper, and we've cut it down to there's not much left to cut,"" he said. ""Anybody who thought that one chess move to somehow ban China from H20s would somehow cut off their ability to do AI is deeply uninformed.""

He added that the China AI market is worth $50 billion a year. ""China's doing fantastic, 50% of the world's AI researchers are Chinese and you're not going to hold them back, you're not going to stop them from advancing AI,"" he told Thompson, who published the interview in his newsletter, Stratechery.

Last week, the Financial Times and Reuters said Nvidia is looking to open a research and development center in China, which a person familiar with the matter confirmed in an email to Yahoo Finance.

Just as Nvidia's H20 chips were banned, Chinese tech giant Huawei was rushing to fill the gap. Huawei is reportedly set to ship chips more powerful than Nvidia's H100s.

Huang called Huawei ""formidable"" and ""a world-class technology company.""

Nvidia is set to report its first quarter earnings on May 28. Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya said in a note to investors Monday that Nvidia executives' post-earnings call with analysts ""could be contentious"" due to the recent H20 restrictions.

Trump's restrictive trade policies — his tariffs and AI chip export curbs to China — have sent Nvidia stock tumbling in recent months, just as investors are scrutinizing whether Big Tech can sustain its hundreds of billions in spending on AI infrastructure.

The stock got a reprieve last week after Trump eased US chip trade restrictions with the rest of the world, scrapping a Biden-era rule that was set to cap AI chip exports to most countries. Optimism over its deal to supply chips for Saudi Arabia's AI buildout also boosted the stock.

Despite his criticism of the China export ban, Huang said, ""The President has a vision of what he wants to achieve, I support the President, I believe in the President, and I think that he'll create a great outcome for America, and he'll do it with respect and with an attitude of wanting to compete, but also looking for opportunities to cooperate.""

392,NVDA,What a UAE Deal Might Mean For SMCI,"This has been a pretty eventful week for SMCI and the AI sector as a whole. the acquisition of a [$20 billion deal](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/saudis-datavolt-signs-20bn-deal-with-supermicro/) with DataVolt in Saudi Arabia and a 39% jump in share price off the strength of the news and overall AI sentiment improving is enough to make any degen hard as solid veiny diamonds. One thing this week that has especially caught my eye is UAE's plan to construct a [5GW AI Campus](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2025/05/uae-and-us-presidents-attend-unveiling-phase-1-new-5gw-ai-campus-abu), with the help of G42, that will house 5GW worth of data center racks and span **10 square miles**.

To put this into perspective, thats:

* 50k 100kW full-scale liquid-cooled racks
* 3.2 **million** Nvidia Blackwell (B100) chips
* More power than NYC and San Francisco **combined**
* Equivalent to powering **3-4 million** homes or running **50 million** gaming PCs at full power 24/7

As you can see, this is an insanely ambitious feat the UAE is trying to achieve. Nonetheless, I couldn't help but ask myself, of the roughly 50k racks the UAE plans to procure, how many of those racks will be SMCI? Furthermore, whatever amount of racks SMCI does provide, how much money does SMCI stand to make from the project? Most importantly, What does that mean for the share price?

First, we need to understand what DCBBS is, and how it actually benefits customers with large scale projects like the UAE AI Campus.

DCBBS stands for **Direct Connect Backplane Building Block Solutions**, and it’s SMCI's proprietary system architecture for building **full AI racks,** not just individual servers. This means when a customer selects which AI rack configuration they want, when it arrives at their door, it comes in a form [like this](https://trendspider.com/blog/dell-and-super-micro-power-musks-ai-ambitions/). In other words, customers are getting Kitchen-Aid refrigerators sent to their fucking door that contain 30-90 Nvidia Blackwell chips and liquid cooling systems within them. No more receiving your SMCI rack order in individual server pieces that you have to assemble on your own. This greatly increases the speed in which these new data centers can go live. In most cases, these racks can be installed and plugged in in **under a day.**

Additionally, this also helps to increase their margins over time.

Traditionally, SMCI sold servers as modular building blocks. things like:

* 1U and 2U server chassis
* Motherboards
* Power supplies
* GPU trays

Customers (like system integrators, VARs, or hyperscalers) would assemble these into racks themselves. That’s low-margin business, because you’re selling parts, not solutions. the DCBBS racks contain:

* CPU &amp; GPU servers (e.g., Nvidia Blackwell, AMD EPYC, Intel Gaudi)
* Total liquid cooling (cold plates, manifolds, chillers, etc.)
* Network switches
* Rack management software
* Power distribution units (PDUs)

Why does this new model increase margins? Because it is a shift SMCI is making, from selling modular pieces that must be assembled, to selling complete solutions that are pre-assembled and ready for use upon arrival. This gives SMCI increased pricing power and in turn, increased margins. Below is a comparison table to illustrate the logic:

|Old Model (Per Server)|Rack-Scale Model (Per Rack)|
|:-|:-|
|Sell parts separately|Sell the full system integration|
|$5K–$15K ASP/server|$250K–$2M ASP per rack|
|6–10% gross margin|**15–25%+ gross margin**|
|Low-value add|**Turnkey AI solution** = premium pricing|

Now lets go more in depth:

**1. Higher Average Selling Price (ASP) per Unit**

* Traditional air-cooled servers sell for **$10K–$50K** each.
* Liquid-cooled **DCBBS racks** (often 64–96 GPUs) sell for **$2–5 million per rack**.
* Even if gross margins stay in the 8–10% range, **gross profit per rack is 40×–80× higher** than per-server sales.

Higher ASP = greater dollar-margin per unit sold, allowing SMCI to increase overall margins even with a similar percentage.

**2. Bundled Value = Control Over Margin Levers**

With DCBBS, SMCI is not just selling a server, it’s delivering:

* 8–12 liquid-cooled GPU servers
* 2000+ liquid-cooled racks a month
* Integrated CDUs (coolant distribution units)
* Power delivery + networking
* Cabling, plumbing, and chassis integration
* Software/BIOS optimization

All of these are designed, manufactured, and **assembled in-house**, which means:

1. Vertical integration reduces dependency on low-margin commodity components
2. Custom bundles let SMCI charge more for value-added services
3. Standardization improves yield, reduces warranty risk, and shortens labor cycles

**3. Faster Time-to-Deployment = Premium Pricing Power**

SMCI can ship **fully integrated, plug-and-play racks in 3–4 weeks**, while others take 8–12 weeks+ with multiple vendors.

For hyperscalers and AI startups racing to bring GPU clusters online, this **speed translates into willingness to pay more**, or at least not negotiate down.

For example: A customer buying a $2.5M rack from SMCI may avoid:

* Extra $500k/month in AI cloud rental costs
* 3–4 month delay in deploying AI training models
* Facility delays in retrofitting for traditional HVAC-based servers

Below is a table below comparing liquid-cooled racks Time-to-Deployment between SMCI and its competitors:

|**Vendor**|**Liquid-Cooled Rack Output (Est.)**|**Time to Deployment**|**Notes**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**SMCI**|**\~2,000+ racks/month**|**3–4 weeks** (from factory)|DCBBS fully integrated, scalable, Blackwell-ready|
|**Dell**|*Unknown (not disclosed)*|\~6–10 weeks (unverified)|IR7000 liquid-cooled racks for hyperscalers, but no output figures released|
|**HPE**|*Limited modular deployments*|\~8–12 weeks (pods)|Offers liquid-cooled AI systems (e.g. Cray EX, Apollo), but mostly for supercomputing clients|
|**Lenovo**|*Unknown*|6+ weeks (via FIS programs)|Neptune liquid cooling, but most integration is not turnkey at SMCI pace|

This “time-value” premium enhances margin per contract.

**4. Liquid Cooling = Lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for Clients**

Clients benefit from:

* 30–50%+ reduction in power usage (no fans/blowers at server level)
* Higher rack density → fewer racks → less real estate
* Reduced HVAC burden → capex + opex savings

Because DCBBS racks are pre-validated and ready for 80–100+ kW loads, customers can safely go denser per rack — which:

* Makes SMCI’s per-rack offering more economically valuable
* Lets them preserve pricing vs. air-cooled OEMs like Lenovo, HPE, or Dell, who may cut prices to remain competitive

Higher value-to-customer means more pricing power = higher gross margin

**5. Operational Efficiency at Scale**

SMCI is building out:

* A 3 million square foot manufacturing campus in Silicon Valley and Malaysia
* A supply chain optimized for GPU pre-allocation, liquid cooling parts, and just-in-time rack assembly

This allows SMCI to:

* Mass produce racks with minimal retooling
* Reduce per-rack cost at high volume
* Use contract-based repeat orders (like the DataVolt $20B deal) to plan capacity

Economies of scale + predictable assembly processes = declining cost/unit → rising margin

Below is a comparison table illustrating the margin impact:

|**Advantage**|**Margin Impact**|
|:-|:-|
|High ASP per rack|Higher gross profit in dollar terms|
|Bundled hardware/services|Increases perceived value + vertical profit|
|Speed to deploy (3-4 weeks)|Pricing premium vs. slower OEMs|
|Energy/cooling savings for customer|Improves TCO → preserves SMCI pricing power|
|Factory integration at scale|Lowers per-rack cost with volume|

So far, we've learned how DCBBS can substantially decrease build times for customers and how it could potentially increase margins for SMCI.

Now to the fun part: The UAE Deal

After doing some ape fisted carpet eating math, I estimate that the total cost of the 5GW AI Campus would be about $125 billion (assuming **each rack** draws about 100kW and sells for $2.5 million). Based on these numbers, I had ChatGPT build a table with a break down of what SMCI would get based on various percentages of the project they would be responsible for and superimposed a likelihood of occurrence formula in there:

|Coverage %|Likelihood of Occurrence|Racks Provided|G42 Total Payment to SMCI|Estimated Gross Profit (USD) 9.7%|Estimated EBITDA (USD)|Estimated EPS|Implied Share Price (@20x PE)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1%|Highly Likely (90%)|500|$1,250,000,000|$121,250,000|$103,062,500|$1.87|$37.40|
|2%|Very Likely (80%)|1000|$2,500,000,000|$242,500,000|$206,125,000|$3.75|$75.00|
|5%|Likely (65%)|2500|$6,250,000,000|$606,250,000|$515,312,500|$9.37|$187.40|
|10%|Possible (45%)|5000|$12,500,000,000|$1,212,500,000|$1,030,625,000|$18.74|$374.80|
|25%|Plausible (25%)|12500|$31,250,000,000|$3,031,250,000|$2,576,562,500|$46.84|$936.80|
|50%|Unlikely (10%)|25000|$62,500,000,000|$6,062,500,000|$5,153,125,000|$93.70|$1,874.00|
|100%|Very Unlikely (3%)|50000|$125,000,000,000|$12,125,000,000|$10,306,250,000|$187.40|$3,748.00|

As you can see, even with a conservative PE of 20x and 9.7% margins, if SMCI gets even 2-5% of the project, thats an EPS of $3.75-9.37 and a share price of $75-187 a share.

**How ChatGPT Calculated the Likelihoods**

This wasn’t a statistical model but rather a strategic probability estimate based on 5 weighted factors:

**1. Historical Precedent (30%)**

* No hyperscaler or government has ever given 100% of a 5GW AI deployment to one vendor.
* Datavolt gave SMCI a $20B deal, but likely part of a larger multi-phase build — suggesting up to 25% is plausible.

**2. Industry Norm for Diversification (25%)**

* Large clients (e.g. AWS, G42, Meta) **split procurement across 2–4 OEMs** for risk mitigation, price leverage, and geopolitical hedging.
* Most national-scale AI campuses split rack-scale work among **Dell, Lenovo, HPE, SMCI, Nvidia integrators**, etc.

**3. SMCI Production Capacity (20%)**

* SMCI can output \~5,000 racks/month total, **2,000+ liquid cooled**.
* To hit 50–100% coverage of a 5GW facility, they’d need to commit 6–12 months of global capacity, which limits probability unless it's multi-year.

**4. Geopolitical Alignment (15%)**

* SMCI already has deep regional partnerships (Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi), so 10–25% is well within reach.
* But **50–100%** would likely require **exclusive national alignment**, which is rare unless the vendor is sovereign or majority-owned.

**5. First-Mover Advantage &amp; Time-to-Deploy (10%)**

* SMCI’s lead time (3–4 weeks vs. 8–12 weeks) is a massive advantage.
* For urgency-sensitive contracts, this could **justify awarding 25% or more** — but not 100%, barring a disruption in Dell/HPE supply.

I think its also important to add, two job listenings have been posted for positions in Abu Dhabi:

[Account Sales Manager](https://jobs.supermicro.com/job/United-Arab-Emirates-Abu-Dha-Sales-Account-Manager/1148026500/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

[Technology Enablement Engineer](https://jobs.supermicro.com/job/United-Arab-Emirates-Abu-Dha-Technology-Enablement-Engineer/1246502400/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)



All in all, SMCI could stand to make a assload of money from a G42 UAE deal.

Last but not least, Cramer is [“Sick of”](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/jim-cramer-is-sick-of-super-micro-computer-stock-should-you-sell-smci-now/ar-AA1F0NkN?ocid=finance-verthp-feeds) SMCI

  
TL:DR: SMCI provides the fastest Time-to-Deployment of any of its competitors with its liquid-cooled DCBBS solution and this could help increase margins overtime and make it a more attractive buy to larger customers ready to deploy immediately. Capturing even 5% of the G42 UAE deal could result in a share price of $180+ a share. SMCI is already hiring for positions in Abu Dhabi.

As you can see, even with a conservative PE of 20x and 9.7% margins, if SMCI gets even 2-5% of the project, thats an EPS of $3.75-9.37 and a share price of $75-187 a share.

**How ChatGPT Calculated the Likelihoods**

This wasn’t a statistical model but rather a strategic probability estimate based on 5 weighted factors:

**1. Historical Precedent (30%)**

* No hyperscaler or government has ever given 100% of a 5GW AI deployment to one vendor.
* Datavolt gave SMCI a $20B deal, but likely part of a larger multi-phase build — suggesting up to 25% is plausible.

**2. Industry Norm for Diversification (25%)**

* Large clients (e.g. AWS, G42, Meta) **split procurement across 2–4 OEMs** for risk mitigation, price leverage, and geopolitical hedging.
* Most national-scale AI campuses split rack-scale work among **Dell, Lenovo, HPE, SMCI, Nvidia integrators**, etc.

**3. SMCI Production Capacity (20%)**

* SMCI can output \~5,000 racks/month total, **2,000+ liquid cooled**.
* To hit 50–100% coverage of a 5GW facility, they’d need to commit 6–12 months of global capacity, which limits probability unless it's multi-year.

**4. Geopolitical Alignment (15%)**

* SMCI already has deep regional partnerships (Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi), so 10–25% is well within reach.
* But **50–100%** would likely require **exclusive national alignment**, which is rare unless the vendor is sovereign or majority-owned.

**5. First-Mover Advantage &amp; Time-to-Deploy (10%)**

* SMCI’s lead time (3–4 weeks vs. 8–12 weeks) is a massive advantage.
* For urgency-sensitive contracts, this could **justify awarding 25% or more** — but not 100%, barring a disruption in Dell/HPE supply.

I think its also important to add, two job listenings have been posted for positions in Abu Dhabi:

[Account Sales Manager](https://jobs.supermicro.com/job/United-Arab-Emirates-Abu-Dha-Sales-Account-Manager/1148026500/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

[Technology Enablement Engineer](https://jobs.supermicro.com/job/United-Arab-Emirates-Abu-Dha-Technology-Enablement-Engineer/1246502400/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)



All in all, SMCI could stand to make a assload of money from a G42 UAE deal.

Last but not least, Cramer is [“Sick of”](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/jim-cramer-is-sick-of-super-micro-computer-stock-should-you-sell-smci-now/ar-AA1F0NkN?ocid=finance-verthp-feeds) SMCI

  
TL:DR: SMCI provides the fastest Time-to-Deployment of any of its competitors with its liquid-cooled DCBBS solution and this could help increase margins overtime and make it a more attractive buy to larger customers ready to deploy immediately. Capturing even 5% of the G42 UAE deal could result in a share price of $180+ a share. SMCI is already hiring for positions in Abu Dhabi.

393,NVDA,Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang Is Set to Speak at Computex Sunday—What You Need To Know,"Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang is set to take the stage this Sunday at Computex, an annual technology trade show, with this year’s theme—“AI Next”—focused squarely on the emerging technology that has lately powered growth in the company's business.

Huang’s keynote, which will be livestreamed from Taipei’s Music Center at 11 p.m. ET Sunday, is expected to highlight Nvidia’s latest advances, and may bring announcements of new partnerships.

Shares of the AI chipmaker’s stock were little changed Friday. They’ve added roughly 15% this week as a Saudi Arabian partnership announced Tuesday during President Donald Trump's trip to the Middle East raised hopes for future deals. The recent gains have helped Nvidia shares edge back into positive territory for the year. The potential for new announcements at Computex could present another catalyst for the stock, along with the company's first-quarter earnings report due May 28.

At last year’s Computex, Nvidia had announced the successor to its Blackwell AI chip, known as Rubin, sending shares higher. Huang in March said Rubin is still set to launch in 2026.

""We would expect relatively positive news on the AI front out of Computex next week,"" Wedbush analysts told clients in a note Friday.

Other chipmakers are also scheduled to present later in the week, with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) set to showcase its latest developments on Tuesday.

175,NVDA,What upcoming data/reports/events to watch out for that could impact the market?,"Could be good or bad. I’m thinking the market will continue trending slightly upwards until negative economic news/data really starts hitting. What I’m watching out for:

Negative:
1. “Liberation day 2” - if 50+ tariff announcements are made in 2-3 weeks
2. Pharmaceutical tariffs (maybe this week)
3. Semiconductor tariffs (maybe in June)
4. If empty store shelves occurs (if it happens probably in June)
5. If countries retaliate against tariffs: retaliatory tariffs (likely at some point), selling US debt like Japan (unlikely near term), halting US goods purchases (like China did with Boeing)
6. Enforcing sanctions against countries (China) getting oil from Iran
7. Effects of decreased tourism/consumers in foreign countries purchasing less American goods like Canadians/federal and private layoffs/loss of consumer spending and labor from deportations/tariff impacts 

Could swing either way
1. Pce report for April
2. June jobs/inflation/manufacturing reports
3. Q2 gdp report (which could indicate recession)
4. 90 day pause on reciprocal tariffs ending - does Trump extend or enact
5. NVDA earnings
6. Fed June meeting (unlikely to cut rates)
7. Fluctuation of value of the dollar

Positive:
1. Trade agreements/foreign countries agreeing to purchase additional US goods

May. 12, 2025 – May 16, 2025","First of all, I don’t want to be misunderstood. This heat map is weekly that it reflects closing prices from May. 9 to May. 16. 

After April, this month continues very positive. The S&amp;P 500 has not closed negative this week and only 3 negative days this month. The U.S. made a trade deal with China which had a positive effect. CPI and PPI inflation came below expectations and supported the stock market.

Here are the S&amp;P 500's week-by-week results,

Day-by-Day Standouts;

🔸 Monday: In the last weekend, Scott Bessent and He Lifeng had scheduled meeting in Switzerland. We heard good news about tariffs between U.S. and China. The U.S. will reduce tariffs to 30% and China will apply 10% tariff for the next 90 days. The stock market responded positively and the S&amp;P 500 opening over 2.5% and closed more than 3%. 🟢

🔸 Tuesday: CPI inflation was released before the market opened and came in below expections. Core CPI inflation expected at 0.3% and came in at 0.2%, while yearly rate remained stable at 2.8%. The stock market also continuing to optimisim from between U.S. and China trade deal. The S&amp;P 500 closed higher nearly 1%, but DJI30 closed lower due to UnitedHealth Group (UNH) which had a rough week. Their CEO announced step down for personal reasons. As you see the heat map, the stock down more than 23% in a week. DJI30 is price-weighted index and significantly impacting. 🟢

🔸 Wednesday: It was a quiet session following 2-day winning streak. Tech stocks helped lift the indexes. Tesla gained over 17% and Nvidia rose more than 16% this week. The S&amp;P 500 ended the day flat, but still in positive. 🟢

🔸 Thursday: Key economic data was released. PPI came in below expectations like CPI, while jobless claims were in line with expections. The stock market opened lower around 0.5%, but the S&amp;P 500 recovered losses in the afternoon. Despite this, all of the Magnificent Seven companies closed lower. Tesla, Nvidia, and Google were closed lower that only closed negative on Thursday this week. The S&amp;P 500 still closed higher. 🟢

🔸 Friday: Preliminary May consumer sentiment data showed 1-year inflation expectations rising to 7.3% and the highest level since 1982. It's early data and revisions are generally minor that could be around 0.2 or 0.3%. Meanwhile, the VIX dropped to lowest level since March 25. 🟢

Currently, inflation is decreasing, but expectations are rising sharply. Last month, 1-year inflation expectation was 6.5% and this month it jumped to 7.3%. After Powell’s remarks, the market does not expect a rate cut before September. What do you think about inflation and interest rate cuts? And how was your week?

(Bloomberg) — CoreWeave Inc. shares surged 22% to a record high on Friday after Nvidia Corp. reported a larger-than-anticipated stake in the cloud-computing provider.

Nvidia, the world’s most valuable chipmaker, disclosed a holding of 24.18 million shares, or about 7% of outstanding stock, as of March 31. That stake, included in a 13G filing on Thursday, compared with a 5.2% figure in CoreWeave’s prospectus.

The amount shows how Nvidia supported CoreWeave’s late-March initial public offering, acquiring about 6 million shares to add to its existing holding. A representative for Santa Clara, California-based Nvidia declined to comment.

Nvidia, which has fast become one of the most influential companies in Silicon Valley, anchored the IPO with an order of about $250 million, a person with knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg News at the time. That was roughly 17% of the deal, before the over-allotment option.

Like Nvidia, CoreWeave has benefited from the surge in spending on artificial intelligence computing. The Livingston, New Jersey-based company is accelerating capital spending to meet demand for its services, but that’s increasing its red ink. Losses widened to $1.49 a share last quarter, compared with 62 cents a year earlier.

On Friday, the shares jumped to $80.30. That’s more than double the $40 IPO price from March.

In addition to backing CoreWeave, Nvidia provides the crucial components that let the data center provider handle AI traffic. Access to this limited supply of Nvidia chips means that CoreWeave is able to offer the most advanced capabilities for the creation and running of AI services.",27,13,1747482234.0,2025-05-17T11:43:54+00:00,t3_1kor06i,StockMarket

396,NVDA,NBIS will be the next Palantir,"NBIS remain undervalued.

Nebius Group N.V. (NASDAQ: NBIS) is a leading AI infrastructure company with several key investment highlights:

1. Strong Revenue Growth: 

Nebius reported a significant revenue increase to $43.3 million in Q3 2024 from $5 million the previous year, driven by surging demand for AI infrastructure. The company projects an annualized run-rate revenue (ARR) of $750 million to $1 billion by year-end 2025, up from $90 million in December 2024.

2. Jensen Huang and Jeff Bezos

Strategic Investments: Nebius secured a $700 million private placement in December 2024 from high-profile investors, including NVIDIA, Accel, and Orbis Investments, at a 3% premium to the stock’s average price. This capital supports its expansion, particularly in the U.S. Additionally, Bezos Expeditions invested $72 million in Nebius’ AI data business, Toloka, in May 2025, enhancing its growth potential

3. Infrastructure Expansion

Nebius is investing over $1 billion by mid-2025 to build AI infrastructure, including GPU clusters in Kansas City, New Jersey (300 MW campus), and Paris, with plans to triple its Finland data center capacity. It leverages NVIDIA’s latest GPUs (H200, Blackwell) for high-performance AI

4. AI-Centric Platform

Nebius offers a full-stack AI infrastructure, including an AI-native cloud platform and Nebius AI Studio for inference-as-a-service, designed for the entire machine learning lifecycle. Its proprietary technology and 850 AI engineers provide a competitive edge

5. Analyst Optimism

Analysts from DA Davidson ($35price target) and BWS Financial ($51) have issued “Buy” ratings, citing Nebius’ strategic positioning and infrastructure investments. Citron Research projects a $60 share price, calling it an “AI Wall Street darling” due to its NVIDIA partnership and undervaluation compared to peers like CoreWeave.

6. Financial Position

With nearly $3 billion in cash reserves post-fundraise and minimal debt, Nebius is well-funded to execute its growth plans, despite current unprofitability.

7. Diverse Portfolio

Beyond its core AI cloud, Nebius operates Toloka (140% revenue growth in 2024), TripleTen (edtech), and Avride (autonomous driving), creating a robust AI ecosystem.

8. Clickhouse 28% ownership 

valuation soared to 6 billion potentially making nebius holdings worth 1.7 billion$

9. AV ride autonomous software, robotaxis and robot deliveries fund raising. AVride likely in top 3 spot in autonomous driving. Partnerships includes Hyundai, Uber eats, grubhub, rakuten.

Here’s an update with my NVIDIA position and why I’m going to keep holding.

# Recap: Why NVIDIA of all stocks?

I implemented a leveraged trading strategy on NVIDIA for one simple reason.

It is the best stock in the market.

[Pic: NVIDIA’s long-term growth analysis](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/0*xe8gsEe4ovl9-bDI.png)

Most of the time, if we see a stock growing at 70% 3-year CAGR for their revenue, that stock is growing in tens of millions of dollars. NVIDIA is quite literally the only exception, growing in tens of billions of dollars.

But that’s just from personal experience looking at stock financials. If we look at the data, the data shares the same story.

[Pic: Stocks with a 30% or more 10-year CAGR and a higher 3-year CAGR](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*ivulGpG2TZuEmxuuYGD2TQ.png)

I used AI to query for stocks with a high 10-year CAGR and an even higher 3-year CAGR. This question is designed to look for fast growing stocks that may be accelerating in their growth. And of stocks with a market cap above $12 billion, NVIDIA is literally 1 of 2 stocks.

NVIDIA is:

* Growing at a 40% 10-year CAGR
* Growing at a 70% 3-year CAGR
* Has a revenue of $130 billion and a market cap at $3 trillion

No other stock really comes close. KKR is growing at a slower rate (34% 10-year CAGR and 50% 3-year CAGR), but if we look closer at their fundamentals, we see a company that isn’t nearly as fundamentally strong.

[Pic: Looking at KKR’s revenue and net income for the past 5 years – it follows a “crash-and-climb” pattern, and we’re not certain what the next value will bring](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1744/1*yrdSlkV3dOYlyPYOWjcKNQ.png)

But it’s more than just its unbelievable growth fundamentals. At its core, NVIDIA is THE business powering the AI revolution.

Not “one of the businesses”. It is THE business.

NVIDIA sells supercomputers that are capable of training AI models. Without NVIDIA’s hardware and software ecosystem, ChatGPT and similar models would’ve never existed.

More than that, other future applications of AI, including advanced autonomous robotics, self-driving cars, and the ability to develop new medicines to cure diseases, will be powered by NVIDIA’s technology.

Let me re-emphasize this point: no other company comes close. Not AMD, Intel, nor Huawei. This is not my opinion – this is fact that ALL AI researchers know. It’s just the average person that doesn’t understand.

With this combination of amazing fundamentals and a moat securing its future growth, you might guess that some sort of earnings announcement is responsible for the massive rally we’ve seen recently.

You’d be wrong.

# What changed in the market since April?

With NVIDIA, soaring from $95/share to $135/share (an increase of over 42%), you would imagine that NVIDIA released some crazy new technology or had a significant advancement, right?

Well, no. That didn’t happen.

Don’t get me wrong. There were lots of catalysts for NVIDIA stock. For example, [the U.S. and China is agreeing on a 90-day tariff reduction](https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/sp500-and-nasdaq-100-super-micro-nvidia-lead-tech-stock-surge-in-us-indices-rebound-1518953), which is an overall bullish signal for stocks. Additionally, [NVIDIA and AMD have agreed to supply chips to the Saudi Arabian AI startup Humain](https://www.investopedia.com/nvidia-leads-chips-stocks-higher-on-optimism-about-new-partnerships-trade-deals-11733944). This further drove positive sentiment in NVIDIA.

But fundamentally, nothing has really changed. NVIDIA has yet to report their earnings, which are scheduled for May 28th. That’s when the real test comes — when we see if the market’s enthusiasm will be validated by actual financial results.

The current rally appears to be driven more by market sentiment and positioning ahead of earnings rather than any material change in NVIDIA’s business fundamentals. This is exactly why I’ve been strategically selling some positions while maintaining my core holdings.

# What’s Next For My NVIDIA Position?

Now that my account has reached all time highs and my buying power has surged to nearly $25,000 (more than my total portfolio value just a few weeks ago), my strategy is now extremely simple.

Hold.

As NVIDIA was having its rally, I’ve been selling off my positions. In total, I’ve sold nearly $10,000 in NVIDIA from April 22nd to May 12th.

[Pic: How many NVIDIA calls I”ve sold in the past month](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*BHZuvjia7SMMmfU8jl2u3A@2x.jpeg)

And I’ve sold more than enough. Now my goal is to hold and ride the rally to test my hypothesis from the very beginning. Is NVIDIA the best stock in the entire world with an unbelievable and unstoppable growth story? Or is “AI” hype – a fad like cryptocurrency with no material use cases.

The world will see soon enough.

# Should you buy NVIDIA calls?

Seeing such returns, you might wonder if NVIDIA calls are for you. If you share a strong belief in AI’s future and see NVIDIA’s valuation as justified by its growth and market position, then considering an NVIDIA position could make sense.

However, let’s be very clear: **call options are inherently risky.** They offer leverage, which magnifies gains, but also losses. You can lose your entire investment (the premium paid) quickly. Time decay works against option buyers, and calls can expire worthless if the stock doesn’t move significantly in your favor before expiration.

Furthermore, NVIDIA options, especially around earnings, often have high Implied Volatility (IV). This makes them expensive, meaning a substantial price move is already “priced in.” If NVIDIA’s news is merely good, not spectacularly better than expected, or if the stock price doesn’t move enough, those calls can still lose value due to “IV crush,” even if the stock price itself rises.

If you’re a beginner or have a lower risk tolerance, **buying NVIDIA stock directly** is a much more straightforward approach. Alternatively, consider AI-focused ETFs (like [FNGO](https://nexustrade.io/stock/FNGO), for example, which has a significant NVIDIA holding) to gain exposure with diversified risk. Finally, if you’re lacking cash and want to see how much you could theoretically gain, you can start by **paper-trading** NVIDIA on platforms like [NexusTrade](https://nexustrade.io/).

More experienced traders, comfortable with high-risk scenarios and options mechanics, *might* consider NVIDIA calls as part of a well-defined strategy. Even then, consider risk-limiting strategies like long-term debit spreads (to cap losses and reduce cost) or longer-dated calls (LEAPS) to give your thesis more time.

Ultimately, the choice is yours. This is not financial advice. Always conduct your own research and understand all risks before investing.

# Final Thoughts

Whether this rally continues or pulls back post-earnings, one thing is clear: data-driven trading beats hype-driven guessing — every time. My NVIDIA calls didn’t succeed because I’m lucky. They succeeded because I did the research, built a strategy, and stuck to it.

This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

News: [Deepseek Races After Chatgpt As China's AI Industry Soars](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-05-13/deepseek-races-after-chatgpt-as-china-s-ai-industry-soars)

[**NVDA (Nvidia)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&amp;p=d)\- NVDA is set to ship 18,000 of its advanced GB300 Grace Blackwell AI chips to Saudi Arabia's Humain for a 500 MW data center project. Additionally, the Trump administration is considering a deal that would allow the UAE to purchase over a million NVDA AI chips, easing previous export restrictions. This caused NVDA to skyrocket 10 points yesterday, watching for additional momentum today. Interested if we can make an equivalent move today and if the trend is strong, might buy a little if so- note that NVDA has earnings on 5/28. Overall interesting that NVDA is finding sales outside of China, but not sure if the ME can make up the shortfall.

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&amp;p=d)\- TSLA has been on a tear ever since Musk has stepped away from DOGE, going from $275 -&gt; $340 in 5 days. Was watching this since $300, the next major level I'm watching is $350- considering how we exploded upwards after the election, not very enthusiastic to short this unless we go to stupidly high levels like $400+. So for now, biased long. Musk has been controversially politically but the stock performance did hinge on his presence at the company, so interested to see if this is going to blow everyone out of the water shorting it (eg me) like last time lol. 

[**UNH (UnitedHealth Group)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UNH&amp;p=d)\- UnitedHealth Group's CEO Andrew Witty has stepped down, and the company has suspended its 2025 forecast due to higher-than-expected medical costs, leading to a massive selloff yesterday. We dropped close to 70 points yesterday, I was personally hoping for the selloff to reach $300 but ultimately didn't get that far. Bought a little around $310 but will kick this out by selling calls against it because volatility is high. UNH has been through... a lot this year with Luigi and the CEO shooting, the proposed AI to analyze healthcare claims, and now this. We've fallen close to 40% after the *new* CEO stepped down as well. Expecting a small dead-cat bounce and a small slow recovery today, other than that not sure how they're going to navigate out of this.

[**SMCI (Supermicro)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SMCI&amp;p=d)\- Supermicro has announced a multi-year $20B partnership with Saudi data center firm DataVolt to deliver GPU platforms and cooling systems for AI campuses in Saudi Arabia and the United States. Made a pretty large 10 point move yesterday, and I want to see if we can make an equivalent move today to see if the trend is strong- interested in the $50 level.

(Reuters) - The Trump administration is weighing a deal that would allow the UAE to import more than a million advanced Nvidia chips, a quantity that far exceeds limits under Biden-era AI chip regulations, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday.

The deal, which is still being negotiated and could change, would let the UAE import 500,000 of the most advanced chips on the market each year from now to 2027, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.

While one-fifth would be set aside for the Abu Dhabi AI firm G42, the rest will go to U.S. companies building data centers in the Gulf nation, according to the report.

ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, which may announce new data-center capacity in the UAE as soon as this week, could be one of those companies, the report said.

The report comes on the heels of U.S. President Donald Trump securing a $600 billion commitment from Saudi Arabia to invest in the United States.

The Department of Commerce and OpenAI did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment, while Nvidia declined to comment.

Abu Dhabi's artificial intelligence push has mostly been led by state-backed G42, which has drawn increased scrutiny from China hawks in Washington amid fears that the UAE is becoming a conduit for China to receive advanced American AI technology it is blocked from getting directly from the U.S.

According to the Bloomberg report, G42 could purchase computing capabilities equivalent to between 1 million and 1.5 million H100 chips over the lifetime of the deal. That is around four times more than it would have been allowed to buy under a Biden-era chip export control framework, known as AI diffusion, it said.

Intraday Trend and Technical Patterns: May 12, 2025 (Monday) NVIDIA shares jumped 5.44% to close at $123.00

Driven by the positive news of the U.S.-China tariff truce, the stock fluctuated in the range of $120.28 to $123.00 on the day's trading session, and the closing price was the highest point of the day, approaching the immediate resistance level of $124.92

Technically, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has risen to 87, indicating that the short-term is in overbought area and may face profit-taking pressure

The volume of the day is about 222 million shares, higher than the weekdays but slightly lower than the recent month's average of 283 million shares, indicating that the participation in this rally is moderate

The 50-day SMA is near $111.50, far below the current share price, verifying the recent strong upward momentum; while the 200-day SMA is about $125.04, slightly higher than yesterday's closing price, which is the highest point of the day. slightly above yesterday's close, implying that the stock is challenging long-term trend resistance

Key Support &amp; Resistance: Technical support is currently around $114 The uptrend remains healthy if pullbacks don't break below this range

In the short term, the $125 neighborhood has become an important resistance level, corresponding to the 200-day SMA and the upper edge of the previous trading range

After opening on May 13, Nvidia shares continued to Nvidia's stock price continued to be strong, up about 2-3%, and at one point during the session broke through the $125 key resistance level (market capitalization). (market capitalization also close to $3 trillion)

The market expects that with the previous day's surge and high RSI, the stock may see a small increase after hitting the resistance level. Resistance may be followed by a small pullback or consolidation to absorb short-term profit-taking

If it manages to hold above $125, it is expected to turn that level into new support and set the stage for further upside; potential targets above include 52-week highs of 153.13

189,NVDA,Rep Congressman Rob Bresnahan made over +150 trades in the last month,"Hey folks,

I’ve been preparing the dataset for my congressional database and one particular politician was standing out the most.

Rep. Rob Bresnahan’s (R-PA) recent stock activity is surpassing the +150 trades mark. That’s a lot of button-pushing for any investor, let alone someone in Congress.

A few things jumped out at me:

* **Trade Frenzy**: Over 150 individual trades in just 31 days—that’s almost five trades a day, on average.
* **All Over the Map**: He’s not sticking to one corner of the market. Huge tech names (NVIDIA, Alphabet, Texas Instruments), pharma heavyweights (Pfizer, Eli Lilly), even energy players (ConocoPhillips, Occidental Petroleum).
* **Mid-Sized Bets**: Most of his buys and sells land in the $1K–$15K zone, but there are definitely some chunkier moves in the $15K–$50K range.
* **Buy &amp; Sell Balance**: It’s not just one-way traffic—he’s selling almost as much as he’s buying. Sounds like active day trader instead of a “buy-and-forget” play.

When lawmakers trade this much, it puts the spotlight on possible conflicts of interest. Are they making policy while secretly banking on the very industries they regulate? Current rules are supposed to keep things aboveboard, but clearly there’s room for debate on tightening up those ethics guidelines.

302,NVDA,S&amp;P 500 - Market Capitalization vs. Net Income,"While recently looking up the most profitable companies in the US, I found that FinanceCharts provides [tabulated financial information](https://www.financecharts.com/screener/sp-500) for the S&amp;P 500, including current market cap and net income. Since I love making charts, I thought I would create a new one plotting market cap vs. net income for trailing twelve months.

Since it's not feasible to represent all 500 S&amp;P 500 companies on this plot, each one is represented by a black dot. I've taken the effort to depict with corporate logos the biggest companies, including the top 17 by market cap, which includes all of the ""Magnificent Seven"". Additionally, I chose several companies that were outliers in terms of extremely high PE, extremely low PE, or just represent iconic American companies whose logos would be easily recognizable.

There were other companies I couldn't include on this plot because it got too cramped--they were too close to other companies which had logos of a similar color scheme.

Note that companies that have yet to report this quarter include NVDA, AVGO, WMT, and COST. Their net income will likely look much more favorable if I were to update this in a month.

303,NVDA,"Week Recap: It was a quiet week in the markets. The S&amp;P 500 broke both 9-day and 3-week winning streaks. Is this the beginning of a new downtrend? May. 5, 2025 – May 9, 2025","First of all, I don’t want to be misunderstood. This heat map is weekly that it reflects closing prices from May. 2 to May. 9. 

This week was relatively quiet with a mix of positive and negative news and that balanced out. The market closed slightly lower compared to last week. Everyone was focused on the FOMC meeting on Wednesday. Then, equally significant news emerged that a scheduled meeting between the U.S. and China on Tuesday. The S&amp;P 500 broke 9-day winning streak and also ended 9-day streak on Monday.

Here are the S&amp;P 500's week-by-week results,

Mar. 28 close at 5,580.94 - Apr. 4 close at 5,074.08 🔴

Apr. 4 close at 5,074.08 - Apr. 11 close at 5,358.75 🟢

Apr. 11 close at 5,358.75 - Apr. 25 close at 5,523.52 🟢

Apr. 25 close at 5,358.75 - May. 2 close at 5,686.67 🟢

May. 2 close at 5,686.67 - May. 9 close at 5,659.91 🔴

Day-by-Day Standouts;

🔸 Monday: The stock market had in a really good rally. The S&amp;P 500 completed 9-day winning streak and its gained around 7.50% in this process. This week began with renewed concerns over China tariffs following Trump's Sunday statements. Trump announced new 100% tariff on foreign-made movies which pressured on the market. The indexes opened 1% lower and remained weak throughout the day. The stock market closed 1%. Meanwhile, gold began to climb again as investors sought safety. The S&amp;P 500's 9-day winning streak came to an end. 🔴

🔸 Tuesday: The most important event of the week was the FOMC meeting on Wednesday. On Tuesday, markets opened over 1% before upcoming FOMC meetings. Trump also announced the first tariff agreement with India, but it wasn’t enough to lift. The indexes closed down around 1% again. 🔴

🔸 Wednesday: We reached the midpoint of the week with indexes opening slightly positive. The White House announced that Scott Bessent and He Lifeng are scheduled to meet between May 9 and 12 in Switzerland. Later in the day, the Fed held interest rates steady at 4.50%. Jerome Powell struck a negative tone as usual and said that “The risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen,” and signaling a continued ""no hurry, can be patient"" stance. Despite this, the market seemed recovered to close higher. 🟢

🔸 Thursday: Following the recently announced trade deal with India, momentum continued as Trump announced a new trade agreement with the U.K. The stock market responded positively, opening up around 0.5% and closing the day with a gain of about 1%. 🟢

🔸 Friday: The stock market shifted focus to the upcoming May 9–12 meeting between Scott Bessent and He Lifeng. Trump said that an 80% tariff on China ""seems right."" While no further updates followed, the market remained cautious, awaiting potential weekend updates. The day ended flat 🔴

Also today, India and Pakistan have reached a ceasefire agreement.

The stock market is fully focusing on the meetings. We might hear new updates tomorrow. Even a slightly positive signal could be welcomed eagerly by investors. The most critical part of the tariff are with China. If Trump makes another unexpected move on tariffs similar on April 2, it could continue the current upward trend. Of course, the market doesn't move in a straight line, but the overall direction seems likely to remain upward, at least until the S&amp;P 500 reaches its all-time high around 6,100.

How was your week? What do you think about the progress on tariffs? What’s your prediction for next week? Which stock first caught your attention on the map?

180,NVDA,Got the biggest kick to my psyche's nuts in perhaps my entire life,"My mother recently passed and my dad is hanging on in memory care. I'm now running the family trust and so know all of my parent's holdings. Anyways I was going through copious amounts of files and yesterday finally took a closer look at a letter my dad wrote to us on 1/15/2007 before a trip they took up the Amazon, in case something bad happened I could start getting at the money. He provided a printout of all his stock and fund holdings and accounts and two positions really stood out. 

3100 shares of NFLX (~$70k)
1600 shares of NVDA. (~$56k)

We don't own either of those in the trust. Sold at some point perhaps years ago definitely before the extreme run-ups of the 2020's. Probably sold after making several hundred thousand or when they didn't move the right direction.

Today these holdings would be 

21,700 shares of NFLX at $1140 = $24.738 million
96,000 shares of NVDA at $116.65 = $11.198 million


Lesson is don't sell unless you absolutely have to and consider selling smaller chunks versus all or nothing.

409,NVDA,"Down 60% on IREN 25 strike 2026 Call options but not out, 120k to 50k YTD...Never give up! YOLO","**The above picture is from March 2025. See below for updates from August and October 2025. What keeps me up at night is that had I done nothing but hold that position would now as of October be worth over 10x or 1 million+ and had I bought back with that 50k in May it would be up over 100x to 5 million+. Right now trying to get back to 120k from December 2024 value, and bought back IREN call options in September.**

Down but not out. I YOLOD on call options for IREN (Iris Energy) last year and traded from 30k to 130k peak last December before watching it crater. \*Sorry I did hundreds of day trades so there is no one trade to show.\* Was wondering whether to cut my losses when it dropped to 100k in January but kept holding until I finally got out at around 50k. I was trading those 2026 Jan 25 strike call options in the 3 range and then they went 0.1 to 0.2 in April. IREN went from 15 to 6, as low as 5. I got out when they were down 60% so could have been far worse. **IREN is 27+, now 50+, and I didn't check the call options but they must be 4+ by now if not 6+...if not 20+. I could have turned that 130k from December 3 average on the Jan 2026 25 strike by doing absolutely nothing into 1 million plus. If I had bought that April bottom back would be up from 50k to 5+ million. I now lose sleep at night thinking what could have been.**

**August 2025 Account:**

https://preview.redd.it/y5fgrsrpjbmf1.png?width=1524&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=758c898c77f872c85d69212c3420caf9882efd6f

I went from 130k worth of IREN 25 strike 2026 Call options to a 60% loss selling them at 1 from 3, then buying Sol Strategies at 3-4 in March only to be down to 1 another 70% loss. I then added some additional funds and took an instant 25% loss on BMNR. The account went from 130k in December to 14k in August at the low, and I added another 10k which is why it shows around 24k. The loss was 60% by selling IREN at the lows December to March, and then another 70% drop buying Sol Strategies at the highs in March and round tripping twice from high of 4 to low 1 back to new lows 1. The additional 10k in cash was from additional distributions I had from CORZ Core Scientific which were air dropped in my account.

I debated going all in on the Coreweave IPO but decided not to since it looked like if was flop in the 30s and NVIDIA had to bail them out in April. A few months later it pumped to 160+ now around 100+.

So instead, I then got Sol Strategies, HODL CYFRF CYFRD (now STKE) which cratered from the 3-4 range to 1, March to April. It then went back up to 4+ in May and I aped it and doubled down at 4+. And right after that it cratered to 1 and got reverse split 8:1 which makes it about 10 now (my average was 30 from May pre split). I got rekt so now down another 70%. I'm bad at math but what's 130k down 60% and the down 70% on 50k? Whatever it is that's what's left, plus another 10k or so added in cash. I finally capitulated and sold Sol Strategies between 9 and and 10 in September.

P.S. I am the guy who had CORZZ Core Scientific penny warrants from 1, with 70k worth when it was 3, and panic sold at low 2 last April 2024...they then went to 10+ by summer and 18 by the fall and I had expected a potential move to 10 by fall, but had weak hands since sold in the 2s. Then chased it back up with options and made some back.

**Never give up, you can always make it back, but stay away Canadian companies because they are pump and dumps (referring to Sol Strategies). Even if you are right about the general direction of the market you will still get rekt if you pick the wrong thing or have the wrong timing. Also stay away from treasury companies like BMNR, STKE, and SBET.**

**Lesson 1: If you have a high conviction play, average down and double down if crashes short term. Let the trade run it's thesis. That was my mistake.** I should have bought back those IREN call options at the lows and waited until the late summer. Imagine that 130k buying those Jan 2026 25 strikes at 0.1 to 0.3 which are now up literally over 10000% or 100x, with IREN being 50+. Even holding my original position in the 3s would be a 10x by now. I could have made 1 million to 5 million by simply holding a few more months even during a 90%+ crash. Sometimes the best thing to do is nothing, but only if it's a winner high conviction play.

**Lesson 2: Do not touch treasury companies as they dilute.** And never touch Canadian treasury companies like Sol Strategies for the same reason. They are penny stocks and insiders will dump on retail at the highs. Canadian markets do not have the volume or cash to sustain momentum so Canadian tech plays crash from a peak and never recover. There is also no Canadian federal regulator like the SEC so there is lots of insider day trading going on. Sol Strategies STKE went from 40+ in January, to 30+ in May to now barely 5. Solana was higher but Sol Strategies never recovered and the CEO sold shares and left. One of the majority holders was the former Board Chairman who is an Eastern European Poker Player based in Dubai who dumped shares on retail all year long form 40+ to 5.

**Lesson 3: Always look for other opportunities and remember you can make it all back in one trade!** Examples of this are IREN's move from 5 to 50+ in 6 months, and others like the Coreweave IPO 30 to 150+.

**Lesson 4: AI is the future! I now believe the AI thesis is the future combined with crypto.** The right AI plays will have exponential growth and can do literally 10 to 100x gains. IREN is the best example of this for 2025.

**Lesson 5: History rhymes. AI/crypto stocks tend to pump in the summer and year end Nov/Dec, and crash around April.** Markets pump after rate cuts starting in September and especially tech and crypto (see fall of 2021). Announcements of big contracts like Coreweave and CORZ had pumped the stocks multiples within months 3-4x. Things tend to cool off and sell off from mid December to April, with April usually being the lows. This happened both in 2021, 2024 and 2025.

**Next Steps as of August 2025:** I will take what is left about 15k (from 130k) plus another 10k in cash and go all on IREN call options for January 2027 various strikes (35, 40, 45, 50, 70), as I now realize IREN is going to be the next Coreweave 30 to 100-150 target.

**Big Mistake:** I should have bought back the IREN call options at the lows as they hit new highs after going from 3 to 0.1 to 4+, 5+ 6+ etc. I got rekt selling the lows and buying a pump and dump Canadian Solana treasury penny stock and now have 20k left after losing 60% on IREN and another 70% on Sol Strategies AND adding 10k in cash from CORZ additional distributions that were air dropped from old CORZQ holdings. I will YOLO ALL IN on IREN call options Jan 2027 expiry hoping for that 100+ moonshot and a 10x Coreweave style. It could happen by looking at the Coreweave chart as IREN expands AI and buys more GPUs with increases revenue guidance. The new NVIDIA partnership is a tell. IREN should catch up to Nebius and Coreweave in market cap in 2026 which means 100-200 price target or higher by 2027.

**I am now looking to the future and betting everything I have left and then some on IREN CALL OPTIONS with some CIFR and I do believe I can make it all back by December or at least get back to 120k account total. I believe by year end IREN should be around 70-80 which will make me whole again. It could be a lot higher into 2026 like 100+ since Coreweave went from 30 to 160 within months. At least they should be catching up to Nebius market cap.**

**Update August 2025: HODL CYFRF CYFRD Sol Strategies cratered in April and then recovered by May. I tried day trading it but long story short it cratered again and did a reverse split 8:1, and the NASDAQ finally happened in September. Meanwhile IREN pumped to 27 and those call options after being as low as 0.1 recovered to new highs of 4+. Of course I sold them in the 1s from 3s, and after being down 60% now down another 70% on Sol Strategies. Went from 130k to less than 20k. Will take what is left and go all in plus some more added on IREN call options for January 2027 as I now realize IREN is going to be the next Coreweave 30s to 150 target.**

**TLDR: I should have bought back the IREN call options at the lows as they hit new highs after going from 3 to 0.1 to 4+, 5+ etc. I got rekt selling the lows and buying a pump and dump Canadian Solana treasury penny stock and now have 20k left after losing 60% on IREN and another 70% on Sol Strategies. I will YOLO ALL IN on IREN call options for Jan 2027 hoping for that 100+ moonshot and a 10x. It could happen by looking at the Coreweave chart.**

**UPDATE OCTOBER 3, 2025: Slowly making it back total account positions back around 70k (main account plus a small secondary one not shown. The lowest low was in July at under 20k.**

**Full Disclosure: Positions as of October 3, 2025, entered earlier in September. I intend to keep these until mid-December. I also have a second smaller day trading account with about 10k current value and some IREN Jan 2027 50 strike calls. On the smaller account I tried day trading CIFR and IREN call options. The screenshots are all from the main account.**

Sol Strategies HODL CYFRF now STKE was listed on NASDAQ, then cratered 50% same day, then fell another 50% since. I sold the day before the listing was announced and it's now down another 50%. Never ever invest in Canadian tech stocks or treasury companies. I was down 80% since May on it by the time I sold beginning of September. Switched everything to IREN and some CIFR call options. Tried day trading IREN a bit and missed that jump from 25-27 range to 31-33 (was fully in at 27 but then sold out before the OTM call options jumped big the same day and the next day, then panic bought higher in the low 30s so missed another 40% move in 2 days). Fully in now since that 31-33 range in September.

**TLDR: Account has recovered back to over the May peak value, now about 60k in the main account and another 10k in a secondary account. 90% in IREN 2027 January call options, and 10% in some CIFR and Bitfarms call options just in case they go parabolic. I expect IREN to be 70+ by December, possibly closing in on 100. Eventually in 2026 IREN should catch up to Coreweave and Nebius (150+, 200+ target prices) as they announce more GPU purchases and sites come online. The way to go is the neo cloud AI scaler not colocation because that will get a much higher premium for compute. I don't expect a colocation deal anymore but instead rapid expansion of GPU purchases and large jumps in recurring revenue guidance leading to repricing in line with Nebius and then Coreweave.**

**What keeps me up at night is that had I done nothing but hold that position it would now as of October be worth over 10x or 1 million+ and had I bought back with that 50k in May it would be up over 100x to 5 million+. Right now trying to get back to 120k from December 2024 value, and bought back IREN call options in September.**

**October 6, 2025 Update:**  90% in IREN call options, some in CIFR. Still holding until December.

I am invested in Marvell Technology because I had confidence in their potential to stand out in the custom chip market, which is a strong trend with various announcements from major tech companies seeking independence from Nvidia. However, even today, the stock is down -10%, just like during the Q4 results release, which wasn’t bad. It feels like I’m reliving the same nightmare as with AMD. I heard that the postponement of a conference tanked the stock today. I just want to sell everything and find more attractive investments...

413,NVDA,Everything about AMD's earnings tonight,"Okay guys, AMD will report its first quarter earnings after the bell on Tuesday. What are we gonna do? See, I'm the concern about the impact of Trump’s tariffs on chip sales and the health of the AI market ahead of Nvidia’s (NVDA) earnings later this month.

For those who have been paying attention, AMD’s announcement follows rival Intel’s (INTC) report, which saw the company beat on the top and bottom lines but issue lighter-than-anticipated revenue guidance in the second quarter. At the time, Intel CFO David Zinsner blamed the “current macro environment” for creating “elevated uncertainty across the industry.”

PC makers produce a number of their products in China, as well as Vietnam and Malaysia. Computers are currently exempt from Trump’s tariffs, but the administration has said it could implement duties on semiconductors based on the results of the Commerce Department’s Section 232 investigation.

For the quarter, AMD is expected to report adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.94 on revenue of $7.1 billion. The company saw EPS of $0.62 and revenue of $5.4 billion in the same quarter last year. Data Center segment revenue is expected to bring in $3.6 billion in the quarter compared to $2.3 billion last year.

In April, AMD, like Nvidia, announced that the Trump administration instituted tighter export controls on AI chips destined for China. The move effectively cuts off AMD’s ability to ship its MI308 AI processor to the region, and, according to the company, might result in as much as an $800 million charge on inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves. And that could weigh on the company’s Q2 outlook.

I expect AMD to post higher results but guide lower given 1Q strength for MI308. Longer term, this might be a good thing in 2Q with the AI chip ban into China.

For those following AI stocks, you may have noticed them taking a major hit over the past few months on fears that the trade has been overhyped. DeepSeek’s January announcement that it managed to produce high-performance AI models using less than top-of-the-line chips further hammered chip stocks.

Shares of AMD are off 18% year to date and 36% over the last 12 months. Nvidia is down 15% year to date, but still up 22% over the last year.

Unfortunately for AMD the AI story (which is already somewhat tenuous) is likely to drop further on the back of new China sanctions. 

[Chart](https://i.imgur.com/4PdTT1Q.png)

AI chip companies with to deal with the government's AI diffusion rules, which would require certain countries to acquire special licenses to gain access to a limited number of US AI chips.

AMD’s Client segment, which includes revenue from the sale of laptop and desktop chips, is expected to generate $2 billion in revenue, up from $1.3 billion in Q1 last year. There’s the potential that the company could report that it saw a pull forward in sales leading up to Trump’s April 2 tariff announcements.

From what I've read, the core PC business appears to be exposed to channel effects (client shipments last quarter were higher than the peak of the COVID bubble already).

AMD’s gaming business, which includes sales of GPUs and semi-custom chips for video game consoles, is expected to bring in $540 million, a 41% year-over-year decline from the same quarter last year. It's only recently that the Ryzen biz has pivoted from hardcore HPC parts, such as the Instinct MI250-series used in the United States' first exascale supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, to parts competitive with Nvidia for lower-precision AI applications. When it launched, the MI300X boasted up to 32 percent higher performance in certain AI workloads compared to Nvidia's then-flagship the H100, along with more than double the memory and significantly greater bandwidth. 

Sony's (SONY) and Microsoft’s (MSFT) consoles are approaching the second half of their life cycles, which generally means sales slide versus when they initially hit the market. Companies are also raising prices on the systems to contend with tariffs. Sony has increased the price of its PlayStation in Europe, but not in the US. Consoles aren’t exempt from duties like laptops and desktops. As a result, Microsoft announced it is raising the price of its Xbox Series X by $100 to $599. The company also said it’s raising the price of some of its first-party games to $79 from $69.

I usually like to sit out earnings, but am strongly considering puts (a put spread to avoid IV crush). Thoughts?",9,43,1746556585.0,2025-05-06T18:36:25+00:00,t3_1kgc2e3,wallstreetbets
186,NVDA,Why I am extremely bullish,"I know this may contradict prevailing sentiment but I hope you can at least hear me out. I’ve been buying the tariff dip on margin, with $1.4 million invested in blue chip stocks. I’m up 46% in the past month. My largest buys have been in TSM, NVDA, ORCL, CAVA, AMZN, MSFT, META &amp; SMH.

1. Largest tax cut in history is coming. Republicans own the house and senate, and Trump is deadset on cutting taxes by $5 trillion. Obviously not good for the national debt but that will juice the economy big time. 

2. Midterms are coming in 2026, and Trump will not want to have a recession on his hands which would risk him loosing the house and senate. I am fully convinced he launched this tariff war so early on, so he could get it over with before midterms. Trump has pivoted extremely quickly on all reciprocal tariffs aside from china. And he is desperate to start negotiations with china. China and the U.S have both entered a de escalatatory tone, with both sides  making exemptions to tariffs, china expressing willingness to deal with fentanyl, and acknowledging the desire to negotiate- along side acknowledging that the U.S has reached out to them. They are BOTH eager to water down these tariffs and deep down, when both parties want the same thing (reduced tariffs) they will find a way to get it despite all the public bluster. Even if a deal could take months, they will likely have a pause either during or before negotiations. 


3. Rate cuts are coming later this year. It’s likely there will be at least 2 rate cuts before year’s end assuming tariff inflation does not cause extreme inflation. Rate cuts will boost the ability to borrow capital, increase liquidity and stimulating the economy. 

4. We are at the dawn of the largest productivity revolution in history. Everyone has seemed to forget about AI despite big tech earnings and guidance blowing it out of the park. MSFT, GOOG, and META are printing money, and AI is showing incredible returns in the semiconductor and data center space. We are still in the early stages of AI, the smarter it gets the more productivity will increase. 

5. The economy is currently strong. Jobs numbers in April (not a lagging indicator) were impressive. At the end of the day, so long as people are not losing their jobs the U.S consumer will stay resilient. Tariff effects could disrupt that if they stay in effect long term. However I think it’s pretty obvious the worst of the tariffs are temporary. 

6. U.S exceptionalism is nowhere close to ending. We are miles ahead of every other economy in terms of innovation and technology. We lead in services, and nobody is boycotting GOOG, META, MSFT etc in a significant way. These innovative tech companies exist nowhere else in scale and success. Our consumer is 30% of the global economy and nowhere do they have such a wealthy large pool of consumers. We are still the world reserve currency with 59% of currency held abroad is dollars. And nobody, even Trump will let us lose that reserve currency status.",0,159,1746364933.0,2025-05-04T13:22:13+00:00,t3_1kejoo0,stocks

# Fed's Interest Rate Decision Comes Amid Political Pressure to Lower Rates

The Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision on Wednesday comes as the central bank faces increasing [political pressure to lower interest rates](https://www.investopedia.com/trump-hints-at-firing-powell-after-fed-chair-signals-no-rate-cut-soon-11717006). But so far, investors don’t expect the Fed will lower rates from its current levels of 4.25%-4.5%, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch tool.1

194,NVDA,"Figure's Helix &gt;&gt;&gt; Tesla Optimus, 1X, and Unitree, but would they ever IPO?","I'm sure some of you have seen a video showing 2 of Figure's humanoid robots putting away a bag of groceries recently.

Yes, the speed they were putting the groceries away was nothing impressive. But what caught my interest the most was the infrastructure underneath that was driving the behavior. Figure's robots are running on a Vision-Language-Action model (VLA) named Helix. It's the allegedly the first of its kind and allows for the planning and solving of complex tasks WITHOUT pre-programming or demonstrations. Even more impressive, the two robots were actually communicating/collaborating with one another to plan out and complete a longer-term task from start to finish. The model runs on a single layer neural network; and you can a have a fleet of these to learn and improve behaviors autonomously (and though no stats were provided it's said that it can run on low-cost GPUs).

They've been testing these on assembly lines at BMW and are pushing UP in-home alpha tests nearly 2 years to later this year. To me, the infrastructure underlying your ""AI-driven Robot"" is critical; it's what decides who wins and loses and how scalable a product of this kind actually is.  Other robotics companies in this space (minus Boston Dynamics) feel SUPER gimmicky; they made a robot with a cool skin, but rarely talk about what drives decision making. It's either pre-programmed or they haven't gotten that far, which to me sets apart a pretty toy and viable and scalable product. I think what powers decision making should be the FIRST and PRIMARY thing you should talk about for this type of product not an after-thought.

With that being said I get the sense that Figure differentiates itself from competitors in that they really focused on the bones of the product. It's scalable and can be adapted more quickly to different applications because its infrastructure pays mind to that. It's a feature that I think is valuable, and larger institutions like Microsoft, OpenAI, NVIDIA, and individuals with deep pockets like Jeff Bezos have already poured hundreds of millions of dollars into this company's success.

So with all that context above here were a few questions that I had:

The economy is all over the place, any company that wanted to IPO this year is having second thoughts. Also given the above, Figure already has backing from the companies that would be likely candidates to acquire them if they choose to go that route, or if they choose not to these are private investors with deep pockets that would keep them afloat as they get further along in development.

So is this a company you believe would even need to IPO? Does it stay private, or get acquired by a big player in the space? I have my own opinions on why Figure would be a leader in the space by a long shot when it comes to making a product you can scale for a variety of different situations, but if you feel differently, what brings you to your conclusion? And lastly, if this were to IPO in the next few years, how would even go about assigning a value to this? Some estimates from other companies seem blown WAY out of proportion (Musk said something like $25 Trillion by 2040 for humanoid robots which feels ridiculously out of touch), so if they were to IPO what do you think is a reasonable way to evaluate what a company like this would actually be worth? Given how they've advanced certain project timelines what are the chances they get far enough where they'd need to IPO to bring more funding?",4,3,1746324438.0,2025-05-04T02:07:18+00:00,t3_1ke92zf,StockMarket

This week was very positive. Most data and tech company results came in strong and the stock market responded well. We didn’t hear any negative comments or announcements about tariffs. As a result, the S&amp;P 500 closed above ""Liberation Day"" level from April 2 and extended weekly winning streak to 3-week.

9️⃣ 8-day streak: Apr. 22, 2025 to May. 1, 2025 from 5,287.76 to 5,686.67 ( 7.54% )

Here are the S&amp;P 500's week-by-week results,

Apr. 25 close at 5,358.75 - May. 2 close at 5,686.67 🟢

Day-by-Day Standouts;

🔸 Monday: The week started slightly higher after Scott Bessent said that India might be the first trade deal completed this week or next, but its not completed this week. Also, Chinese President Xi and Trump also made several statements, but the session remained quiet. The S&amp;P 500 closed up 0.06%, while the Nasdaq ended in the red. I'll focus on the S&amp;P 500 because it completed a historic streak. It could be the longest streak for a long time. 🟢

🔸 Tuesday: After a 5-day winning streak, the market opened lower around 0.5%. The White House stated ""There is no better time to invest in America."" However, Consumer Confidence came in at the lowest level since March 2020. Despite the weak data, Scott Bessent's positive comments on tariffs lifted the indexes and recovered their early losses. The S&amp;P 500 closed up around 0.5%. 🟢

🔸 Wednesday: Before the session began, preliminary Q1 GDP data was released. The economic results werent't well received and the stock market opened down more than 1%. This data is always revised later because it's release twice time and final one is real one. So, it may not reflect the full picture. And then, PCE data came out. It's drop back to June 2024 levels. That helped shift sentiment. Nasdaq recovered their 2% loss and closed flat. On the other hand, S&amp;P 500 closed higher 0.15%. 🟢

🔸 Thursday: Tech companies releasing Q1 results. After Wednesday's close, Nvidia and Meta released strong Q1 results and beating expectations. On the other hand, jobless claims rose the highest weekly level since October 2024. As a results, the strong tech momentum pushed markets higher throughout the session. The S&amp;P 500 gained 1%. It's 8th day in the winning streak. 🟢

🔸 Friday: Thursday’s data showed the job market is growing faster than expected. On the other hand, over 97% of analysts don't expectation a rate cut in May. After Thursday's close, Meta and Apple released Q1 results. Meta reported 6% rise in daily active users and the stock jumped around 5%. Apple beat estimations for sales, but service revenues came in below estimations. Investors are also concerned about iPhone sales because of tariff risks. I think the most important thing for Apple that the company lost lawsuit against Epic Games. Maybe you know, Apple wants to make from developers that all in-app must transaction through their services on App Store and taking 30% commission (or 15% for developers making under $1 million annually). Now, developers can manage their own payment system on the app. That means, Apple could not take 15% or 30% in this transactions. This could reduce their service revenues. As a result, Apple stock dropped more than 4% as strong day in the stock market. The S&amp;P 500 closed higher 1.45%. 🟢

# I lost $16,649 on NVIDIA. Here’s why I bought more

[Pic: My Robinhood account year-to-date](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*YFWnQLfnDOdnK2c43E58vw@2x.jpeg)

Before I describe why I bought more NVIDIA, I want to start this article with a strong disclaimer.

This is NOT financial advice.

The reason why I’m able to make such a risky decision is that I have saved enough money from my day job where if I lost this money, it would not significantly affect my quality of life. This investment strategy is extremely risky, and is not suitable for the vast majority of investors.

With that being said, I wanted to answer the question that I’m asked most often: what is my actual trading strategy?

Here’s why I decided to trade long-term call options on NVIDIA.

# Describing how I built my trading strategy

My trading strategy is based on many of the leveraged strategies that I’ve backtested with my algorithmic trading platform.

[Pic: A leveraged TQQQ trading strategy on NexusTrade. It includes the backtest results, the percent change, shape ratio, sortino ratio, and drawdown for this strategy and SPY](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*h4MAOl2YXlLXllH8o808TA.png)

As someone who has seen the performance results of over 5,000 backtests, I’ve come to the conclusion that trading leveraged ETFs is one of the fastest ways to make outsized returns over the long run… at a cost.

An insane amount of volatility.

For example, take a look at the picture above. This TQQQ trading strategy earned more than twice as much as buying and holding SPY over the past 5 years (even after the massive drawdown this past week).

But at an extreme cost. The drawdown for the leveraged strategy is more than twice the drawdown of holding the S&amp;P 500.

Simply put, from these backtests, I’ve learned that leveraged strategies are one of the fastest ways to “get rich quick”, if you’ve accepted the risk that you might quite literally lose it all.

With this in mind, here’s how I applied this knowledge to develop a NVIDIA options trading strategy.

# Developing a NVIDIA options trading strategy

To deploy this strategy, I manually execute trades using Robinhood. However, I developed this strategy using the NexusTrade platform. Let me show you how.

NexusTrade does not natively support options trading (yet), so to develop the strategy, I used an alternative: [NVDL](https://nexustrade.io/stock/NVDL).

This is a leveraged ETF. With this stock, if NVIDIA goes up 1%, NVDL goes up 2.

This is a (rough) approximation of NVIDIA options, but it is far from perfect. For example, options are far more complicated. They experience time decay, and have expiration. Nevertheless, you can pretend that NVDL represents a deep in-the money NVIDIA call debit spread.

Let’s start with the base-case. Let’s assume NVIDIA goes up 20% in the next year. This is far more than the average of SPY’s 10% per year.

Let’s create a strategy that beats the market assuming this happens.

&gt;Create a strategy. The rules is if we have no positions in NVDL, we will buy 30% our buying power in NVDL

[Pic: From 01/01/2024 to 01/01/2025, this strategy outperformed the market significantly because we were in a bull market](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*AXNeYHflKtduicRyUiCGAA.png)

Specifically, if we look at the performance, this strategy gained 125%, while SPY gained 25%. It also had a higher sharpe ratio and sortino ratio than holding SPY during this period.

[Pic: The strategy had a percent gain of 125% versus SPY’s 25%. The sharpe ratio was higher (1.48 vs 1.24) and the sortino ratio is higher (2.69 versus 1.88). It also had a higher max drawdown (21% versus 10%).](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*Y0j9u4o3fF1IJBXKpK4Vpw.png)

This was the assumption that I made. I assumed that NVIDIA would go up 20% because of advancements in artificial intelligence led by NVIDIA’s monopoly on GPUs.

I was wrong. So I had to deploy my contingency plans.

# Context: Why did I choose NVIDIA?

Before I discuss my contingency plan, I want to talk about *why* did I choose NVIDIA in the first place.

It’s the best stock on the planet.

**Fundamental Analysis**

The reason why I chose NVIDIA over any other stock or cryptocurrency can be summed up in one picture.

[Pic: The growth trends for NVIDIA. it shows the 3-year, 5-year, and 10-year CAGR for NVIDIA’s revenue, net income, gross profit, operation income, EBITDA, total assets, and free cash flow](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*RVe0YyFuGxCAQ8zZGmMwUQ.png)

This is the growth trend analysis for [NVIDIA](https://nexustrade.io/stock/NVDA). As someone who has seen similar analyses for over 1,000 stocks, including Apple, Amazon, Google, AMD, and Meta, I have quite literally never seen a stock growing so fast.

In this screenshot, it shows a 40% 10-year CAGR for NVIDIA’s revenue. 40% annual growth is genuinely mind-blowingly insane. I mean, for most companies, 10% is considered amazing. And I’m not making this up.

For instance, let’s look at the most valuable company on Earth: [Apple](https://nexustrade.io/stock/AAPL).

[Pic: Apple’s CAGR, balance sheet, cash flow, and other metrics](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*8DHHjdtkQtKxvpyJq90JKg.png)

In comparison to NVIDIA, which has a 40% 10-year CAGR, Apple has an 8%. Their 3-year CAGR is even worse, at 2.24%.

NVIDIA’s 3-year CAGR is 70.

[Pic: A look at NVIDIA’s revenue growth YoY. It gained 682% in 5-years](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*lhlRdNvjIeEgVsN10HFo5w.png)

So, while tech giants like Apple are barely growing at all, NVIDIA is printing cash unlike anything we’ve ever seen. Even if NVIDIA’s revenue is completely flat on the year (which it very likely would not be with innovations like Blackwell), they still have a compound annual growth rate that destroys even the best stock in the world.

**Domain Expertise**

With this fundamental analysis, I combined it with my domain expertise in artificial intelligence.

I’ve loved AI even before it was cool. I took a course called *Introduction to Artificial Intelligence* when I was completing my Bachelors in Computational Biology at Cornell University. Then, still enthralled, I took the hardest course in my entire life, Intro to Deep Learning, when I was getting my Masters in Science in Software Engineering from Carnegie Mellon (the best school in the entire world for artificial intelligence).

[Pic: The ranking of schools in AI according to US News and World Report](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*8GynEwrMxrGb7YzkU6C04A.png)

After graduating, I kept working in AI, and built the first platform that uses AI to help retail investors make smarter investing decisions.

[Link: NexusTrade - No-Code Automated Trading and Research](https://nexustrade.io/)

I say all of this to say: I know artificial intelligence VERY well. I know that we are not slowing down in AI progress. In fact, I would dare say we’re going even faster. GPT’s image generator, Perplexity’s Deep Research tool, and Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet are innovations made in the past two months that would’ve been jaw-droppingly useful 2-years ago.

Now? It just feels like an everyday occurrence.

And the applications for this are insane.

* **Video games:** one of my dreams is to build a competitor to the Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Being able to generate ALL of the assets using AI? All I would need to do is apply my creativity. I’m very good at that.
* **Movies:** imagine any Benjamin Jones who graduated from Dartmouth with a degree in writing. He can, quite literally, put his degree to use, and create feature-length films with just $25,000 and OpenAI’s Sora.
* **Software development:** this should be self-evident to any software engineer. Tools like Cursor are not going away.
* **Marketing:** with GPT’s newest image generator, creating marketing images has never been easier.
* **Sales:** with tools like [LeadGenGPT,](https://github.com/austin-starks/LeadGenGPT) it has never been easier to do cold outreach campaigns.

I’m willing to bet my entire Robinhood account that NVIDIA’s revenue does not slow down DESPITE the tariffs. If I’m right and NVIDIA’s stock continues to fall, I will deposit $25,000 and buy even more.

# Activating my contingency plan

As I mentioned in the beginning, I made an assumption about NVIDIA’s future returns. This assumption was violated in the worse way possible.

Specifically, instead of gaining 20% from starting the position like I thought, NVIDIA has fallen drastically.

[Pic: NVIDIA’s change in stock price](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*_CAMCmCrIh6CzCZGo4QcYg.png)

In the past 6 months, NVIDIA has fallen 25%. Holding options, I experienced a significant setback, losing over 41% year-to-date.

[Pic: My Robinhood balance year-to-date](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*l_ocWTLd06QQGkUqHIN5yg@2x.jpeg)

Believe it or not, this actually closely aligns with what you’d see in the backtests with NVDL.. of course less dramatically.

[Pic: NVDL strategy lost 18% year-to-date](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*LF2JL40wHbIhIiEqpi8DIg.png)

According to the backtests, the way I’ve seen to survive this is simple.

Hold and buy more.

&gt;Create a strategy. The rules is if we have no positions in NVDL, we will buy 30% our buying power in NVDL. Another rule is if our NVDL positions are down 15%, buy 50% of our buying power in NVDL

&gt;Create a strategy. The rules is if we have no positions in TQQQ, we will buy 30% our buying power in TQQQ. Another rule is if our TQQQ positions are down 15%, buy 50% of our buying power in TQQQ

[Pic: Backtesting for the past year for NVDL](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*ApJfQgKA7cE4qJtPWa1wBA.png)

[Pic: Backtesting for the past year for TQQQ](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*S11IW8ik6K39osh0yhBFXQ.png)

By adding a new trading rule, we can attempt to recover losses by buying more when the stock is low. For instance, let’s look at the following backtest.

&gt;backtest both across Covid

I created a new strategy for TQQQ to demonstrate what happened during Covid. NVDL is a new stock, and didn’t exist in 2020.

[Pic: The stock had a 0% return because the stock didn’t exist](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*IwQgC-PnD9ii4R2lhT6TIw.png)

However, if we pretend NVDL is TQQQ, we can see what happened.

[Pic: TQQQ had a return of 17% during this period while SPY was down 4%.](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*G9M9SrX3vHp8aGN9VXN4fQ.png)

All we did was double down when the stock was low. We can keep doing this until we run out of money, and for short to medium term bear markets, the strategy survives.

And if it doesn’t then 🤷🏾‍♂️. I accepted the risk when I purchased my first option. I’m ready to accept the consequences.

# Concluding Thoughts

As I’ve said from the beginning, this is not a strategy that I’d recommend to the vast majority of people. I’m in an extraordinary place in my life to deploy such a risky strategy.

Nevertheless, I wanted to be transparent.

I’ve shown you my trading strategy, my significant losses, and why I’m doubling down on NVIDIA despite the recent downturn. Because here’s what I believe.

NVIDIA’s fundamental growth metrics are unmatched in the market. AI adoption WILL continue to accelerate, and leveraged strategies, while volatile, can deliver exceptional returns when deployed with proper risk management and conviction.

The backtests I’ve shared demonstrate how buying more during downturns has historically helped recover from temporary setbacks. This is exactly the approach I’m taking with my own capital.

199,NVDA,NVDA is eyeing a breakout,"Nvidia ($NVDA) is trading in a tight zone, but options positioning hints at a possible pop. Today’s key level is $113. If the stock holds above that mark into the close, it could clear the path for further upside.

Just take a look at the notional value stacked around $113 in puts—over $35 million in premium sitting there, according to the chart. That’s one of the largest put walls on the board. If NVDA stays above $113, those bearish bets start to fizzle. Market makers and hedgers might unwind protective positions, potentially releasing more buying pressure into next week.

Meanwhile, there’s a big spike in call value sitting at the $115 strike. That could act like a magnet if momentum picks up. The $115 level has over $60 million in call notional value—easily the largest on the chart.

Institutions seem to be leaning bullish here, or at least expecting a move higher. If the $113 wall collapses, $NVDA could chase that call-heavy zone above $115 in the coming days.

Feels like one of those inflection points—either NVDA holds and rips, or it wobbles and the short-term upside fades.

I think we heard three important things. The first came yesterday. Strong results from Meta and Nvidia gave investors hope. Today, news released that the U.S. reached out to China to talk tariffs. I’m not sure that is true. Also, the weekly jobless claims data was released and the highest level since October 2024.

As a result, Nasdaq closed at 17,601.05 on April 2 that the day of ""Liberation Day"". One month later, today closed at 17,710.74. The S&amp;P 500 extended winning streak to 8-day. I checked past records and found the nearest comparable streaks,

8️⃣ 8-day streak: Apr. 22, 2025 to May. 1, 2025 from 5,287.76 to 5,603.42 ( 5.96% )

188,NVDA,"Inheriting a small fortune, considering how to invest it until 2029 in the current climate","This is probably an extremely tired topic, but wanted some advice, or at least some personal stories from people who have had experience in the market.

When the 2020 pandemic crash happened, I was 21 and had some money, so I started looking into investing. I was a complete rookie and an idiot, thinking that I was good at choosing companies when it was just a ridiculous bull market, and after coming out on a small plus side, I let go of the market for a very long time.

In February of this year, my father suddenly passed away. As we were going through his accounts and our family assets, we realized he was quite good with money, and alongside his monthly pension that will be given to my mother, we learned that we were going to be well off. After careful calculation, my mother decided to keep the pension, and one third of my father's assets. I was given around two thirds of the assets, which came out to roughly 280,000$.

I'm from Korea, and for my entire life, always dreamed of moving to the States for a high paying job, but never had the money to get the education in order to do so. Now I do.

After crunching the numbers, I've decided to put aside 80,000$ to pay for my living costs, tuition costs to prepare for my education in the States, and for some traveling. This will keep me fairly comfortable until the end of 2028. Which leaves 200,000$ for me to invest in, in order to build up my net worth for my time studying in America, before finally getting a job.

Then Trump announced the tariffs, and I started to reconsider everything.

Thankfully, I was mostly cash when the market went down, and afterwards I had invested  up to 50,000$ back into the market. Mostly focusing on either dividend heavy companies or ETF's like VOO, SCHD, KO, PEPCO, and powerhouse tech companies like NVDA, AMZN, MSFT, and other sectors, as well as companies in other countries.

My issue now is whether to wait for the doom mindset that so many people seem to have about the current US administration and the market to take full effect and tank everything, or do I just DCA into the company roster that I made for the next few months, and just let the market do its thing for the next 3 to 4 years. I know that timing the market is stupid, and even if you time it perfectly, it's so stressful anyways. I kinda just want to invest and not think about it constantly.

I woud love to hear your long-term investing stories to settle my mind. Been very anxious about all of this in the last month or so.",4,30,1746081530.0,2025-05-01T06:38:50+00:00,t3_1kc29d1,stocks
198,NVDA,Nvidia stock gets a rare Sell rating on Wall Street as AI push is 'priced in,"No paywall: [https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/nvidia-stock-gets-a-rare-sell-rating-on-wall-street-as-ai-push-is-priced-in-4013034](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/nvidia-stock-gets-a-rare-sell-rating-on-wall-street-as-ai-push-is-priced-in-4013034)

[Investing.com](http://Investing.com) \-- Nvidia received a rare Sell rating from Seaport Research Partners in a note Wednesday, with the firm setting a $100 price target on the stock, citing valuation concerns and a shift in sentiment around AI adoption.

They argued that the chipmaker’s gains from artificial intelligence are already fully reflected in its share price. 

“Nvidia is one of the leading beneficiaries of the current AI spending boom, but its prospects are well understood and largely priced into the stock,” Seaport wrote. 

While the company’s next-generation Blackwell chips are already sold out for the year, the firm cautioned that “bias is to downside risks.”

Seaport also flagged logistical challenges and a murky return on AI investments as red flags. 

“Our research indicates significant complexity required for deployments of Nvidia (NASDAQ:[NVDA](https://www.investing.com/equities/nvidia-corp)) systems,” they said, citing cooling, configuration, and orchestration hurdles. 

They added that there are “mounting questions as to \[the\] utility of AI” as enterprise customers continue to “search for use cases and ways to generate returns from significant AI investments to date.”

A growing risk, Seaport warned, comes from Nvidia’s own customers. “Strong momentum behind hyperscalers’ internal Nvidia alternatives – Nvidia’s largest customers are all looking to design their own chips,” the analysts noted.

The firm believes AI may not be a bubble but anticipates a slowdown ahead. “Likely to see slowing of AI budgets in 2026,” they said, adding that while “AI may do well this year, NVDA is likely to underperform relative to peers.”

Their $100 price target is based on a discounted cash flow model using a 7.5% growth rate and 11.5% discount rate. 

Seaport cited risks to its bearish view, including “unforeseen advances” in AI that could accelerate demand and “unexpected growth” from major customer orders.",22,9,1746054291.0,2025-04-30T23:04:51+00:00,t3_1kbu3h0,StockMarket

The firm said it expects to have about 210 delivery stations up and running as part of a broad effort to establish a dedicated rural delivery network that began in 2020. It operated about 70 such facilities at the end of 2023, Amazon spokesperson Alexa Clark said, declining to specify say how many the company operates today. By the end of 2026, Amazon said, it will have invested $4 billion total in the project.

The largest online retailer has spent the past decade building a massive logistics operation that includes hundreds of warehouses in and around major cities and a network of bespoke contractors that hire drivers who pilot blue Amazon-branded vans.

Businesses across sectors have meanwhile faced pressure to announce US spending pledges since President Donald Trump returned to office in January, vowing to revive the economy and bring back American jobs. Major tech companies in particular, including Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp., have laid out plans to spend hundreds of billions of dollars in the US. Amazon executives earlier this year discussed trying to make an announcement with Trump about the company’s own US spending, Bloomberg has reported.

For rural areas, Amazon historically handed off most of shipments to carriers like the US Postal Service or United Parcel Service Inc. UPS said this week that it expected to cut 20,000 jobs this year and close dozens of facilities as it reduces shipments for Amazon. The ecommerce giant estimates the rural network initiative will have created 100,000 jobs, including the direct employees who staff Amazon’s warehouses and drivers who employed by contractors.

Bloomberg reported earlier this month that Amazon was considering a $15 billion warehouse expansion, including delivery hubs, a move that would reverse the company’s post-pandemic construction slowdown.",17,7,1746048586.0,2025-04-30T21:29:46+00:00,t3_1kbry8e,StockMarket

205,NVDA,How to use ChatGPT to help trade stocks (you can’t),"Do me a favor right now.

Go on ChatGPT or Claude 3.7 Sonnet or whatever AI model you think is the best and ask it the toughest financial question you can think of.

I don’t mean something like “why is NVIDIA down after hours?” or “what was Apple’s revenue last quarter?”. I mean some truly unhinged shit.

Don’t worry. I’ll wait.

If you don’t know what to ask, here’s a tough question that literally no major AI model has answered correctly.

&gt; What biotechnology stocks were unprofitable last year, are profitable this year, have increased their net income every quarter for the past 4 quarters, and have increased their revenue every year for the past 4 years? Filter to stocks with a market cap below $20 billion.

But why would you want to know this? Let’s say you truly believe in your heart-of-hearts that biotechnology is going to be the next “AI”. That there exists a biotech company out there right now that’s poised for “NVIDIA-like” growth. And all you need to do to set yourself up for generational wealth is find it.

No major large language model… not Claude or Gemini or ChatGPT or none of them. Not a single large language model can truly help you answer the toughest financial questions.

NexusTrade can.

# Asking LLMs to find our needle in the haystack

Before I show you the biotech stock I found within 30 seconds using NexusTrade, let’s see what the major LLMs answer for this question.

**ChatGPT**

[Pic: ChatGPT’s answer](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*jvGenTYpBA3INTtVW9w0BQ.png)

Even with web search enabled, we can see that ChatGPT was unable to find stocks with our criteria. The key quote from its response is:

&gt; Identifying biotechnology stocks that were unprofitable last year, have turned profitable this year, and have shown consistent quarterly net income growth over the past four quarters, along with annual revenue growth over the past four years, is a complex task. This information is not readily available in the provided data.​

It gave us some biotech stocks, but not stocks that conformed to our criteria. In other words, **it failed.**

What about every Cursor user’s favorite AI model, Claude 3.7 Sonnet?

**Claude 3.7 Sonnet**

[Pic: Claude 3.7 Sonnet’s answer](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*cqBD8UK1G4htLxfQzRk5gA.png)

Claude did an even worse job. Without access to real-time information, it could not tell us the answer to your question. The key quote being:

&gt; I don’t have access to real-time financial databases or stock market data

But maybe that’s just the popular language models. What about the up-and-coming favorite model of every normal person, Google’s Gemini?

**Gemini 2.5 Pro**

[Pic: Gemini 2.5 Pro’s answer](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*wcDTbC_vshVAN3iUAg7c7A.png)

Gemini’s answer wasn’t just wrong. It was also incredibly misleading. Its key quote being:

&gt; it appears **extremely difficult, if not impossible, to find stocks that currently meet *all* these stringent criteria simultaneously.**

This is wrong. There IS a stock that conforms to this criteria and its easy to find. And I’m going to prove it.

But first, let’s try the one and only model that actually came close – Grok 3.

**Grok 3 with DeepSearch**

[Pic: Grok 3’s answer](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*dkrzRtx0T4WX55G5fg7r3Q.png)

After thinking for 2 minutes and 8 seconds and searching through 148 sources, Grok found 3 stocks that conformed to our criteria.

[Pic: The 3 stocks that were identified: AXSM, EXEL, SMTT](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*XBuAjvaI_sjWi3jdyRwnVQ.png)

However, if we actually looked at these stocks, we see that they do not conform. For example,
- [AXSM](https://nexustrade.io/stock/AXSM) is unprofitable last year and this year

[Pic: AXSM’s profitability](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*8YdJBLb_haJOMNGrtLxUzQ.png)

- Similarly, [EXEL](https://nexustrade.io/stock/EXEL) was profitable last year and even more profitable this year

[Pic: EXEL’s profitability](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*bkNO1xfGwrFPOe16FnleIw.png)

- Finally, [SMMT](https://nexustrade.io/stock/SMMT) has the same story about not conforming to our criteria.

[Pic: SMMT’s profitability](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*J429lJTn5k5XH9YwhezCNA.png)

With this comes an undeniable proven fact. For the toughest financial questions, ChatGPT, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Grok’s 3 with DeepSearch are all unable to find accurate, data-backed answers to the question.

NexusTrade can.

# Asking NexusTrade to find our needle in the haystack

Let’s ask the NexusTrade AI the same question. For your convenience, [you can read the full conversation with this link.](https://nexustrade.io/share/68114b869ba296f44603db92)

[Pic: Aurora’s (NexusTrade’s AI) response](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*hN6UuR8mSKPSWAVfKUikgQ.png)

NexusTrade’s AI identified [INSP](https://nexustrade.io/stock/INSP) as a stock that conformed to our criteria. But does it actually?

**Profitable this year and unprofitable last year, have increased their net income every quarter for the past 4 quarters**

[Pic: Annual net income for INSP](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*6oYbkkwkHRfi4Q_xnjMLrQ.png)

The net income for [INSP](https://nexustrade.io/stock/INSP) was -$21 million last year and positive $53 million this year. It’s also in an uptrend.

**Have increased their net income every quarter for the past 4 quarters**

[Pic: Quarterly net income for INSP](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*aOjNPZA1jbH1l5iRfb3IRw.png)

We can clearly see that the net income has increased every quarter for the past 4 quarters.

**Have increased their revenue every year for the past 4 years**

[Pic: INSP’s revenue for the past 5 years](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*2YxqBz3K-6wJaxUCPo6wNA.png)

Additionally, we clearly see that the revenue for [INSP](https://nexustrade.io/stock/INSP) has increased every year for the past 4 years.

**Filter to stocks with a market cap below $20 billion.**

[Pic: INSP’s market cap](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*b_vpmlUQpeefuICfe9y4Sg.png)

Finally, we see that INSP’s market cap is $4.6 billion, making it poised for exponential growth.

From this, we clearly see that unlike every single major LLM provider, NexusTrade was able to find [INSP](https://nexustrade.io/stock/INSP). Literally a diamond in the haystack. But the real question is… how?

# How does NexusTrade work?

NexusTrade was built by me, Austin Starks, an AI expert with a Masters from Carnegie Mellon. I built it to answer any type of financial question accurately. But how does it work?

Behind the scenes, NexusTrade queries through fundamental data provided by the [high-quality fundamental data provider EODHD](https://eodhd.com/pricing?via=austinstarks&amp;ref1=nexustrade).

[Pic: A diagram showing how the NexusTrade AI fetches for stocks](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/0*QK5kUsvFoc-ibJ9v.png)

It works by:
1. Generating a SQL query to a database
2. Executing the query and getting the results
3. “Grading” the output of the model and retrying when the grade is low
4. Formatting the results and sending it back to the user

It’s not like ChatGPT or Grok. It doesn’t search the web praying the answer is on an obscure blog. It truly searches through fundamental data and gives you the answer. And, it works for questions that uses technical or fundamental data.

Accurate results in less than 30 seconds.

However, it’s not just the fact that the NexusTrade AI helps search for stocks. You can also use the results of this query to become a better investor.

&gt; Want high-quality fundamental data for your financial application? [Check out EODHD](https://eodhd.com/pricing?via=austinstarks&amp;ref1=nexustrade)! In my 4 years of developing NexusTrade, it has the BEST fundamental data that I’ve ever seen.

# What to do with this list of stocks?

After finding out NexusTrade can indeed find this gem of a stock, I had a huge question.

What the fuck is INSP?

Rather than go on Google and trying to figure out what this stock is, I simply asked the NexusTrade AI.

I simply said the following to the AI, and it happily obliged.

&gt; Do a deep research report on INSP. What is this stock?

This created a comprehensive report on INSP. I learned that the business was Inspire Medical Systems Inc, and that they developed medical technology to help people with sleep apnea. I also learned that their product actually works extraordinarily well.

However, thus report is too long for a Medium article. While, [you can read the full article here](https://nexustrade.io/share/68114b869ba296f44603db92), I also decided to summarize it.

[Pic: Asking Aurora to summarize this report](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*l9FuqpXFbNV-sXg-LjjHgg.png)

According to Aurora, this is what INSP is.
- **Medical Technology Company:** Inspire Medical Systems (INSP) develops and sells minimally invasive solutions for Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA).
- **Flagship Product:** Their main product is the Inspire system, an FDA-approved implantable neurostimulation device that keeps the airway open during sleep.
- **Target Market:** It’s designed for moderate to severe OSA patients who cannot tolerate or get consistent benefit from CPAP therapy.
- **Growth &amp; Financials:** The company has shown strong revenue growth, recently achieved profitability, and is expanding its market presence both in the U.S. and internationally.

Thus, if you’re looking for a growing, fundamentally strong biotech stock, INSP might be the answer for you.

For me, I’m not actively looking for new stocks to buy. I have a crazy NVIDIA trading strategy that’s taking up all of my attention. So for now, I’m going to add it to my watchlist.

# Concluding Thoughts

The quest for finding undervalued stocks with genuine growth potential isn’t just challenging — it’s nearly impossible with today’s generalist AI tools. Look at what just happened: ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and even Grok all failed spectacularly at finding INSP despite their supposed intelligence and web-searching capabilities. NexusTrade found our needle in the haystack in seconds because it’s built specifically for investors who need answers backed by real financial data, not best guesses.

This is why serious investors are ditching ChatGPT and moving to specialized tools like NexusTrade. The ability to instantly filter through thousands of stocks using specific financial criteria — then immediately deep-dive into the fundamentals of promising candidates — is a game-changer for retail investors who want institutional-grade insights. When you consider how many hours of manual research NexusTrade saves, the value becomes undeniable.

190,NVDA,US Economy Contracts for First Time Since 2022 on Imports Surge,"&gt;The US economy contracted at the start of the year for the first time since 2022 on a monumental pre-tariffs import surge and softer consumer spending, a first snapshot of the ripple effects from President Donald Trump’s trade policy.

&gt;Inflation-adjusted gross domestic product decreased an annualized 0.3% in the first quarter, well below average growth of about 3% in the prior two years, according to the government’s initial estimate published Wednesday. Net exports subtracted nearly 5 percentage points from GDP, the most on record, the Bureau of Economic Analysis report showed.

&gt;Consumer spending — which accounts for two-thirds of GDP — advanced at a 1.8% pace, the weakest since mid-2023. Business outlays for equipment, the lone bright spot in the report, increased an annualized 22.5%.

|Indicator|Actual|Estimate|
|:-|:-|:-|
|GDP|\-0.3%|\-0.2%|
|Personal consumption|\+1.8%|\+1.2%|
|PCE price index, excl. food, energy|\+3.5%|\+3.1%|

&gt;The GDP data highlight the scramble by companies to secure merchandise ahead of expansive tariffs. Looking ahead, many economists anticipate the higher duties will cause a supply shock, challenging businesses and leading to a pullback in demand as higher prices push cash-strapped Americans closer to the brink.

&gt;Forecasters currently see nearly even odds of the US falling into a recession in the next year. Consumers are also growing increasingly anxious that tariffs will take a toll on the labor market and drive up the cost of living.

&gt;The latest GDP figures showed imports surged an annualized about 41% — the biggest advance in nearly five years. Because these goods and services aren’t produced in the US, they are subtracted from GDP. Economists see the sharp widening of the trade deficit reversing in the second quarter.

&gt;Typically, imported merchandise moves into warehouses or directly to storefronts. However, the report showed business inventories contributed 2.25 percentage points to GDP during the quarter, the most since the end of 2021. The recent flood imports may instead show up in higher inventories in coming months and, along with a narrowing trade gap, provide a lift to second-quarter GDP.

&gt;Because swings in trade and inventories can sometimes distort overall GDP, economists prefer looking at final sales to private domestic purchasers for a better snapshot of demand. This measure increased at a 3% pace in the first quarter after rising an annualized 2.9% at the end of 2024.

&gt;Growth in consumer spending was driven by services and nondurable goods.

**My take:** As is commonly said, we haven't even begun to feel the effects of Trump's trade policy yet- shortages of products haven't begun hitting American consumers, but we're going to start feeling the effects this summer. We're likely in for a painful day in the markets today.

I'm mainly interested in consumer discretionary companies to day trade (SBUX mainly) and also watching tech names like SMCI (earnings), NVDA/DELL/AMD (off of the new Deepseek news).

206,NVDA,Not a Single Major AI Model Can Answer Your Toughest Financial Questions. NexusTrade Can.,"Do me a favor right now.

Go on ChatGPT or Claude 3.7 Sonnet or whatever AI model you think is the best and ask it the toughest financial question you can think of.

I don’t mean something like “why is NVIDIA down after hours?” or “what was Apple’s revenue last quarter?”. I mean some truly unhinged shit.

Don’t worry. I’ll wait.

If you don’t know what to ask, here’s a tough question that literally no major AI model has answered correctly.

&gt; What biotechnology stocks were unprofitable last year, are profitable this year, have increased their net income every quarter for the past 4 quarters, and have increased their revenue every year for the past 4 years? Filter to stocks with a market cap below $20 billion.

But why would you want to know this? Let’s say you truly believe in your heart-of-hearts that biotechnology is going to be the next “AI”. That there exists a biotech company out there right now that’s poised for “NVIDIA-like” growth. And all you need to do to set yourself up for generational wealth is find it.

No major large language model… not Claude or Gemini or ChatGPT or none of them. Not a single large language model can truly help you answer the toughest financial questions.

NexusTrade can.

# Asking LLMs to find our needle in the haystack

Before I show you the biotech stock I found within 30 seconds using NexusTrade, let’s see what the major LLMs answer for this question.

**ChatGPT**

[Pic: ChatGPT’s answer](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*jvGenTYpBA3INTtVW9w0BQ.png)

Even with web search enabled, we can see that ChatGPT was unable to find stocks with our criteria. The key quote from its response is:

&gt; Identifying biotechnology stocks that were unprofitable last year, have turned profitable this year, and have shown consistent quarterly net income growth over the past four quarters, along with annual revenue growth over the past four years, is a complex task. This information is not readily available in the provided data.​

It gave us some biotech stocks, but not stocks that conformed to our criteria. In other words, **it failed.**

What about every Cursor user’s favorite AI model, Claude 3.7 Sonnet?

**Claude 3.7 Sonnet**

[Pic: Claude 3.7 Sonnet’s answer](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*cqBD8UK1G4htLxfQzRk5gA.png)

Claude did an even worse job. Without access to real-time information, it could not tell us the answer to your question. The key quote being:

&gt; I don’t have access to real-time financial databases or stock market data

But maybe that’s just the popular language models. What about the up-and-coming favorite model of every normal person, Google’s Gemini?

**Gemini 2.5 Pro**

[Pic: Gemini 2.5 Pro’s answer](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*wcDTbC_vshVAN3iUAg7c7A.png)

Gemini’s answer wasn’t just wrong. It was also incredibly misleading. Its key quote being:

&gt; it appears **extremely difficult, if not impossible, to find stocks that currently meet *all* these stringent criteria simultaneously.**

This is wrong. There IS a stock that conforms to this criteria and its easy to find. And I’m going to prove it.

But first, let’s try the one and only model that actually came close – Grok 3.

**Grok 3 with DeepSearch**

[Pic: Grok 3’s answer](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*dkrzRtx0T4WX55G5fg7r3Q.png)

After thinking for 2 minutes and 8 seconds and searching through 148 sources, Grok found 3 stocks that conformed to our criteria.

[Pic: The 3 stocks that were identified: AXSM, EXEL, SMTT](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*XBuAjvaI_sjWi3jdyRwnVQ.png)

However, if we actually looked at these stocks, we see that they do not conform. For example,
- [AXSM](https://nexustrade.io/stock/AXSM) is unprofitable last year and this year

[Pic: AXSM’s profitability](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*8YdJBLb_haJOMNGrtLxUzQ.png)

- Similarly, [EXEL](https://nexustrade.io/stock/EXEL) was profitable last year and even more profitable this year

[Pic: EXEL’s profitability](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*bkNO1xfGwrFPOe16FnleIw.png)

- Finally, [SMMT](https://nexustrade.io/stock/SMMT) has the same story about not conforming to our criteria.

[Pic: SMMT’s profitability](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*J429lJTn5k5XH9YwhezCNA.png)

With this comes an undeniable proven fact. For the toughest financial questions, ChatGPT, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Grok’s 3 with DeepSearch are all unable to find accurate, data-backed answers to the question.

NexusTrade can.

# Asking NexusTrade to find our needle in the haystack

Let’s ask the NexusTrade AI the same question. For your convenience, [you can read the full conversation with this link.](https://nexustrade.io/share/68114b869ba296f44603db92)

[Pic: Aurora’s (NexusTrade’s AI) response](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*hN6UuR8mSKPSWAVfKUikgQ.png)

NexusTrade’s AI identified [INSP](https://nexustrade.io/stock/INSP) as a stock that conformed to our criteria. But does it actually?

**Profitable this year and unprofitable last year, have increased their net income every quarter for the past 4 quarters**

[Pic: Annual net income for INSP](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*6oYbkkwkHRfi4Q_xnjMLrQ.png)

The net income for [INSP](https://nexustrade.io/stock/INSP) was -$21 million last year and positive $53 million this year. It’s also in an uptrend.

**Have increased their net income every quarter for the past 4 quarters**

[Pic: Quarterly net income for INSP](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*aOjNPZA1jbH1l5iRfb3IRw.png)

We can clearly see that the net income has increased every quarter for the past 4 quarters.

**Have increased their revenue every year for the past 4 years**

[Pic: INSP’s revenue for the past 5 years](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*2YxqBz3K-6wJaxUCPo6wNA.png)

Additionally, we clearly see that the revenue for [INSP](https://nexustrade.io/stock/INSP) has increased every year for the past 4 years.

**Filter to stocks with a market cap below $20 billion.**

[Pic: INSP’s market cap](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*b_vpmlUQpeefuICfe9y4Sg.png)

Finally, we see that INSP’s market cap is $4.6 billion, making it poised for exponential growth.

From this, we clearly see that unlike every single major LLM provider, NexusTrade was able to find [INSP](https://nexustrade.io/stock/INSP). Literally a diamond in the haystack. But the real question is… how?

# How does NexusTrade work?

NexusTrade was built by me, Austin Starks, an AI expert with a Masters from Carnegie Mellon. I built it to answer any type of financial question accurately. But how does it work?

Behind the scenes, NexusTrade queries through fundamental data provided by the [high-quality fundamental data provider EODHD](https://eodhd.com/pricing?via=austinstarks&amp;ref1=nexustrade).

[Pic: A diagram showing how the NexusTrade AI fetches for stocks](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/0*QK5kUsvFoc-ibJ9v.png)

It works by:
1. Generating a SQL query to a database
2. Executing the query and getting the results
3. “Grading” the output of the model and retrying when the grade is low
4. Formatting the results and sending it back to the user

It’s not like ChatGPT or Grok. It doesn’t search the web praying the answer is on an obscure blog. It truly searches through fundamental data and gives you the answer. And, it works for questions that uses technical or fundamental data.

Accurate results in less than 30 seconds.

However, it’s not just the fact that the NexusTrade AI helps search for stocks. You can also use the results of this query to become a better investor.

&gt; Want high-quality fundamental data for your financial application? [Check out EODHD](https://eodhd.com/pricing?via=austinstarks&amp;ref1=nexustrade)! In my 4 years of developing NexusTrade, it has the BEST fundamental data that I’ve ever seen.

# What to do with this list of stocks?

After finding out NexusTrade can indeed find this gem of a stock, I had a huge question.

What the fuck is INSP?

Rather than go on Google and trying to figure out what this stock is, I simply asked the NexusTrade AI.

[Pic: Asking the NexusTrade AI what is INSP](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*UZSVh_P5WckbnHH4MzmNBQ.png)

I simply said the following to the AI, and it happily obliged.

This created a comprehensive report on INSP. I learned that the business was Inspire Medical Systems Inc, and that they developed medical technology to help people with sleep apnea. I also learned that their product actually works extraordinarily well.

However, thus report is too long for a Medium article. While, [you can read the full article here](https://nexustrade.io/share/68114b869ba296f44603db92), I also decided to summarize it.

[Pic: Asking Aurora to summarize this report](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*l9FuqpXFbNV-sXg-LjjHgg.png)

According to Aurora, this is what INSP is.
- **Medical Technology Company:** Inspire Medical Systems (INSP) develops and sells minimally invasive solutions for Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA).
- **Flagship Product:** Their main product is the Inspire system, an FDA-approved implantable neurostimulation device that keeps the airway open during sleep.

- **Growth &amp; Financials:** The company has shown strong revenue growth, recently achieved profitability, and is expanding its market presence both in the U.S. and internationally.

Thus, if you’re looking for a growing, fundamentally strong biotech stock, INSP might be the answer for you.

209,NVDA,"Left my $400,000/year tech job to teach YOU how to trade stocks","# First some self-congratulatory bullshit

Because the title of this article has an extraordinary claim, allow me to first provide some extraordinary evidence.

In January 2022, I joined Oscar Health as a full-time software engineer. This was when the job market was pretty good, and because of my skill as an engineer and the “name brand” of having an MS in Software Engineering from Carnegie Mellon, I was able to negotiate a much higher than average total compensation.

What does “higher than average” actually mean? Let’s break it down.

[Pic: Offer letter from Oscar Health](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*RgCRXGXRJS3vJE7ZvYYLYQ.png)

The offer letter details:

* The starting salary for the position **($145,000/year)**
* The performance bonus of 10% **($14,500/year)**
* The restricted stock units **or RSUs ($45,000/year)**
* A sign-on bonus **($10,000)**

I’m no mathematician, but I’m pretty sure that adds up to **$214,500**. Not bad for a 24 year old.

But it got even better.

Due to exceptional performance, I was promoted to Software Engineer II within one year at the company.

[Pic: My promotion letter from Oscar Health](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*vpyfiLDBPsbUe8VpUdIqXw.png)

This promotion came with a significant increase in compensation. My base salary increased to **$159,500** and my annual bonus increased to **$23,925**. I also got a refresher of **$67,500 (across 3 years)**.

Literal surgeon salary.

The following year was uneventful. My base salary increased to **$165,800**. I received yet another refresher (like every other engineer at the company) and my bonus naturally increased because it’s weighted at 15% of my salary.

So in total:

* I had 6,347 shares of OSCR (initially) + 4,937 shares (after the first refresher) and 1,599 shares (after the second refresher). All together, that equaled **12,883 shares/year**
* At a peak price of **$22.93/share**, that equaled to **$295,484/year** of equity
* My salary was **$165,800 and I had a 15% annual bonus ($24,870/year)**

With all of this, my compensation peaked at an unbelievable **$486,154/year.**

But that’s the peak price, which is misleading. If we take the average price of Oscar Health in 2024 ($16.57), that’s still **$404,293/year**.

[Pic: Asking the NexusTrade AI for the average price of Oscar Health](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*ESB7Z8fFRBSv1ZhAZlW7gg.png)

# Why would I leave tech to be an influencer?

Don’t get me wrong — at heart I’m still a tech guy — a software engineer. I’m just one with an insane plan….

To build my own marketing channel and unlock an infinite money glitch.

You see, for the past half a decade, I’ve been obsessively working on something that would convince even Tony Stark and Elon Musk that I’m the bigger visionary — a new type of investing platform.

But before I talk about the platform, let me explain the “influencer” jab I made at the beginning.

**An unusual approach to marketing**

As a tech guy who built a B2C SaaS company, I struggled with marketing for a while. At first, I just wrote Medium articles and saw a fair amount of success, achieving over 275K views on my articles at my peak in January, and over 145K views in the past month.

[Pic: My Medium views in January 2025](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*ZaJ_Pdtu-U75FYzRy7zLuw.png)

But this wasn’t enough. I wanted more.

I explored my options. I shit-post on Reddit, which works a little bit, but doesn’t give me that “viral” effect that I believe my app deserves. I’ve also tried doing some UGC marketing, but that was expensive and didn’t really achieve the results I wanted.

I ended up realizing that if I wanted to grow my app at the speed I wanted, I would have to do one of three things:

1. Spend a metric fuckton of money on advertisements
2. Spend a metric fuckton of money on bigger influencers for the privilege of an 8 second story post
3. Become an influencer

I’m a smart guy. I went to Cornell and Carnegie Mellon. I’ve built an app that nobody thought was possible.

Thus, if I can literally achieve the impossible, how hard can it *really* be to become an influencer?

So that’s what I’m doing now. While I’m technically a founder or an entrepreneur or a software engineer, I now fully identify as an influencer.

And what exactly will I be “influencing”? I will be fixing the broken retail trading system.

&gt;

**The Problem of Retail Investing**

Right now, almost every single retail investor is a degenerate gambler. They don’t even hide it.

* They maybe know the phrase “DYOR” but don’t know how to *actually* do their own research in practice
* They might build trading plans, but they always crumble in the face of fear and uncertainty
* And, they’re obsessed with getting rich quick, but don’t even know how to build a sensible (high-risk) plan. Instead, they gamble based on 0 DTE SPY calls

Above all, retail investors just truly don’t understand what it means to build a trading strategy.

So I built a web app to fix this.

# An AI Approach to the stock market

I built [NexusTrade](https://nexustrade.io), an AI-Powered trading platform that lets retail investors create, test, optimize, and deploy algorithmic trading strategies.

[Link: NexusTrade - No-Code Automated Trading and Research](https://nexustrade.io/)

It’s basically a website that solves the retail trading problem with the help of AI.

And I know that if you’re in tech, you visibly cringed when I said the letters “A” and “I”. You’re sick of this by now. But unlike Silicon Valley’s darling companies, this app *actually* solves real problems.

This is demonstrated by the reviews of people that have used it.

**The institutional investors that have used NexusTrade**

For example, take the opinion of Jeffery Fan.

[Pic: A Google Calendar Invite between me and Jeffery](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*MyvmNvauusnMYQjdu93v5A@2x.jpeg)

I had an exciting opportunity to talk with Jeff and give him a personalized demo of the platform. Jeffrey works at Scotiabank, the third largest bank in Canada.

And when I say “works there”, he’s not like a janitor or a lowly intern. He has over 3 decades of experience and is the **Managing Director &amp; Global Head of Equity Research**.

I showed him all of NexusTrade’s features, tips, and tricks, and he was beyond impressed. He outright could not believe that a single person was capable of building something so extraordinary. If the Google Meet transcript was recorded, I’d be blasting that everywhere too.

As if one institutional investor isn’t enough, I actually have another.

Take Spencer Kalish.

[Pic: A review of NexusTrade from Spencer K](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*kCS7OBCOOjtO1kAvzf0s_w@2x.jpeg)

Spencer works as the **Global Chief of Staff at UBS**, one of the world‘s largest financial institutions.

Spencer didn’t just think [NexusTrade](https://nexustrade.io/) was cool, he was genuinely shocked at the comprehensiveness of the platform.

Because of his reaction, I mustered up the courage to ask him to let me write a review of the platform to increase my credibility. Everyone claims to have the best trading platform in the world, but how many people have real institutional investors backing up those words?

He happily obliged.

But that’s not all. He also set me up with another meeting to have yet another demo… This time with Jamshed Cooper, the Managing Director of the Non-Core and Legacy Technology Division at UBS.

[Pic: A meeting with me, Spender, and the managing director at UBS on May 8th](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*FDRi5Dso6c08JFIucl-8wA@2x.jpeg)

During that meeting, we’re going to have a technical chat about how NexusTrade works under the hood. Something I’m super excited to nerd out about.

And, **while the opinions of these individuals do NOT represent an official position from the banks** (but rather personal opinions from the individuals within their institutions), the fact that these people genuinely think that the platform I spent so long building was genuinely cool makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.

But it’s not just the big banks that have a positive opinion of Nexus.

More than 20,000 other folks do too.

**Not just for institutions**

In addition to the opinion of these institutional investors, [NexusTrade](https://nexustrade.io/) is enjoyed by over 23,500 users.

[Pic: A graph showing NexusTrade growth over time](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*C_wepAttpFjZ48RCsqU_YQ.png)

Users of all backgrounds and experience levels are enjoying it, from ordinary middle school teachers to senior lecturers at Harvard Business School.

[Pic: A list of reviews for the NexusTrade platform](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*v-I5d8uks9bplyoJHHNC5Q.png)

**What about NexusTrade makes it so useful for retail investors?**

The reason why people of all experience levels enjoy the platform is that it is literally built to be a Wall Street-grade platform with the ease of use and simplicity of Robinhood.

Algorithmic trading is inherently difficult, so it’s still not meant for everybody. Nonetheless, for the savvy investor, this platform LITERALLY teaches you how to become a systematic algorithmic trader. For example:

* [Trading tutorials give you step-by-step instructions on how to create trading strategies and perform financial research](https://nexustrade.io/tutorials)
* [Deep Dives teach you how to analyze a stock comprehensively](https://nexustrade.io/deep-dive)
* [The shared portfolios page allows you to copy, modify, and learn from existing public live-trading portfolios](https://nexustrade.io/shared-portfolio)

For example, [**this article below**](https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/i-evaluated-grok-3-as-the-best-ai-model-for-traders-and-investors-c539d6251a83) does a great job at describing how NexusTrade can be done to perform financial research and deploy algorithmic trading strategies.

# Concluding Thoughts

Leaving behind a $400,000 salary was undoubtedly the biggest financial risk I’ve ever taken, but I believe the potential reward of building NexusTrade into a revolutionary platform for retail investors justifies this leap of faith.

The positive feedback from institutional investors and our growing user base of over 23,500 people confirms that I’m addressing a genuine need in the market.

Becoming an influencer might seem like an unusual path for someone with my technical background, but it’s simply the most effective way to reach the people who need this platform most. The journey from software engineer to founder to content creator has taught me that sometimes the most unconventional routes lead to the greatest innovations.

Biggest trend? **A ton of selling.**

* Darrell Issa dropped **$25–$50 million** in UBS trades.
* Dave McCormick unloading GS and PARA.
* Kevin Hern dumping Morgan Stanley debt.
* Treasury Bills showing up a lot too (hiding in safety?)



And on the flip side:

Some buys starting to pop up:

* Earl Leroy Carter and Marjorie Taylor Greene loading up on Treasuries.
* Ashley Moody picking up tech names (NVDA, SMCI).
* Dave McCormick nibbling on GIS and KBH.

**Bottom line:**

* Selling is still bigger than buying.
* Some are rotating into cash/Treasuries.
* Selective stock buying (especially in tech) is showing up, but not in huge size.

# Darrell Issa’s UBS Sale: Deleveraging or Rate Risk Repricing?

Wanted to call this out specifically because it’s sneaky important:  
Issa’s “sale” wasn’t just dumping stock, it was **getting out of four interest rate caps**.

These caps are basically insurance against rates spiking.  
By selling early (before maturity), it kinda suggests Issa thinks:

* Rate volatility might be calming down.
* Carrying the protection wasn’t worth it anymore.
* He's maybe expecting rates to stabilize or even drift lower.

Seems like someone deep in the political game is *less worried about rates blowing up from here*. Subtle move, but could matter a lot if you're thinking about the next few months.",42,5,1745765556.0,2025-04-27T14:52:36+00:00,t3_1k95r6n,StockMarket
204,NVDA,"China's Huawei develops new AI chip, seeking to match Nvidia, WSJ reports","[https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/27/chinas-huawei-develops-new-ai-chip-seeking-to-match-nvidia-wsj-reports.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/27/chinas-huawei-develops-new-ai-chip-seeking-to-match-nvidia-wsj-reports.html)

China’s Huawei Technologies is preparing to test its newest and most powerful artificial-intelligence processor, hoping to replace some higher-end products of U.S. chip giant [Nvidia](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/), The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday.

Huawei has approached some Chinese tech companies about testing the technical feasibility of the new chip, called the Ascend 910D, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.

The Chinese company hopes that the latest iteration of its Ascend AI processors will be more powerful than Nvidia’s H100, and is slated to receive the first batch of samples of the processor as early as late May, the report added.

Reuters reported on Monday that Huawei plans to begin mass shipments of its advanced 910C artificial intelligence chip to Chinese customers as early as next month.

Huawei and its Chinese peers have struggled for years to match Nvidia in building top-end chips that could compete with the U.S. firm’s products for training models, a process where data is fed to algorithms to help them learn to make accurate decisions.

Seeking to limit China’s technological development, particularly advances for its military, Washington has cut China off from Nvidia’s most advanced AI products, including its flagship B200 chip.

The H100 chip, for example, was banned from sale in China in 2022 by U.S. authorities before it was even launched.

Nvidia declined to comment while Huawei did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.",239,90,1745765347.0,2025-04-27T14:49:07+00:00,t3_1k95ofn,StockMarket

207,NVDA,China May Exempt Some US Goods From Tariffs as Costs Rise,"[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-may-exempt-us-goods-065000386.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-may-exempt-us-goods-065000386.html)

China’s government is considering suspending its 125% tariff on some US imports, people familiar with the matter said, as the economic costs of the tit-for-tat trade war weigh heavily on certain industries.

Authorities are considering removing the additional levies for medical equipment and some industrial chemicals like ethane, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing private deliberations.

Officials are also discussing waiving the tariff for plane leases, the people said. Like many airlines, Chinese carriers don’t own all of their aircraft and pay leasing fees to third-party companies to use some jets — payments that would have become financially ruinous with the additional tariff.

The possibility of some goods being exempted boosted investor optimism, as shares in Asia rose and the yuan erased losses.

“It’s another step toward a de-escalation of the trade war,” Kok Hoong Wong, head of institutional equities sales trading at Maybank Securities Pte, said, attributing strength in Hong Kong, Chinese and Japanese stocks to the report. While most don’t expect the US and China to set aside their differences quickly, he said “it would appear the worst may truly be over.”

The exemptions China is mulling mirror similar moves on the part of the US, which excluded electronics from its 145% tariff on Chinese imports earlier this month. The pullbacks reflect how deeply intertwined the world’s two biggest economies are, with some key industries grinding to a halt after the trade war escalated.

“A couple of our member companies have reported that even within the last week, they had a few shipments that were imported that did not have tariffs levied on them,” Michael Hart, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said during a press conference on Friday in Beijing. “It does look like both governments are looking carefully and don’t want to stop trade overall.”

While the US imports far more from China than the other way around, Beijing’s move spotlights the areas of its economy that remain reliant on US goods. China is the world’s largest plastics manufacturer but some of its factories depend on ethane, which is mainly imported from the US. And its hospitals rely on advanced medical equipment like magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound machines made by US firms like GE Healthcare Technologies Inc.

China’s Ministry of Finance and General Administration of Customs didn’t respond to requests for comment.

The list of exemptions is still in flux and discussions may not progress. Companies in vulnerable sectors have been asked by authorities to submit the customs codes of US goods that they need to be exempt from the new tariffs, other people familiar with the matter said. At least one Chinese airline has been notified that payments to aircraft leasing companies located in free trade zones will not be subject to the new levy, one person said.

Traders have also been circulating purportedly tariff-exempt lists of customs codes that correlate to key chemicals and chip-making components. Bloomberg News could not independently verify the lists.

Beijing is also preparing to waive additional tariffs on at least eight semiconductor-related products, Caijing reported Friday, citing anonymous sources. Those categories don’t include memory chips for the time being, the outlet said, in a potential blow to Micron Technology Inc., the world’s No. 3 memory chipmaker.

What Bloomberg Economics Says...

“Exempting critical, hard-to-replace US products from tariffs would be a pragmatic approach that could ease tensions with the US and serve the interests of Chinese industry. Anything that helps lower the temperature in the trade war is also beneficial from the perspective of avoiding broader clashes with the US.”

— Chang Shu and Eric Zhu

Investors are looking for signs that the two countries will engage to lower tariffs, but relations appear to still be at a standstill. On Thursday, Chinese officials publicly demanded the US revoke all unilateral tariffs before agreeing to trade talks. President Donald Trump has tried to get President Xi Jinping on the phone since he returned to office, but the Chinese leader has, so far, resisted, pushing instead for lower-level talks to work out a deal.

On the US front, Trump’s administration has exempted smartphones, computers and other electronics from its so-called reciprocal tariffs — a major reprieve for global technology manufacturers including Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp., though potentially a temporary one. The exclusions apply to smartphones, laptop computers, hard drives and computer processors and memory chips as well as flat-screen displays.",13,44,1745583664.0,2025-04-25T12:21:04+00:00,t3_1k7jjwz,StockMarket

208,NVDA,Norway’s $1.6 Trillion Wealth Fund Posts $40B Q1 Loss on Tech Downturn,"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/24/worlds-largest-sovereign-wealth-fund-reports-40-billion-loss-in-first-quarter-on-tech-downturn.html?__source=androidappshare

The world’s largest sovereign wealth fund, Norges Bank Investment Management, just reported a $40 billion loss in Q1 2025 — citing weakness in the tech sector as the primary driver.

The fund, which manages over $1.6 trillion in assets, is widely regarded as one of the most diversified and conservative investors globally. But even they weren’t immune to this year’s tech headwinds. According to CEO Nicolai Tangen:

&gt; “The quarter has been impacted by significant market fluctuations. Our equity investments had a negative return, largely driven by the tech sector.”



This underscores how central tech remains to the global markets — and how vulnerable even the most robust portfolios are to its swings. Names like Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and other big tech names have had shaky performances this quarter, dragging down indexes and institutional portfolios alike.

It’s a reminder that volatility in high-weighted sectors can ripple far beyond retail portfolios. When a country-level investor — backed by oil revenues and diversified globally — takes a hit like this, it puts things into perspective.

Despite rising oil revenues in Norway, equity losses eclipsed gains in other asset classes.

For long-term investors, this report is a signal that even large, diversified portfolios can’t escape concentrated market trends. For traders, it’s more confirmation that the current tech correction isn’t just noise — it’s big enough to rattle sovereign funds.",21,8,1745483988.0,2025-04-24T08:39:48+00:00,t3_1k6nbnv,StockMarket
307,NVDA,What are corporate insiders doing with the Mag 7?,"The Mag 7 lost momentum and have seriously lagged this year. ""Dumb money"" (retail investors) have been bag holding, while institutions unloaded early. In some cases, they are starting to buy back in. But what are the actual corporate insiders doing?

Generally, corporate insiders tend to have more net selling activity than buying, because their compensation is generally in the form of stock. That being said, disproportionate selling without buying is somewhat of a red flag. On the contrary, insider buying is a good sign that the leadership believes their stocks are undervalued.

Fortunately, the Nasdaq makes this information easily available for the last 3 and 12 months. For this purposes, the information includes information derived from Forms 3 and 4. Unlike other sources (such as Robinhood), it only includes open market purchases, which are a better signal of insider sentiment.

So how do the Magnificent 7 compare? (Note that Alphabet has two publicly traded class shares, GOOGL and GOOG.)

I've plotted this in graphical form, as well as a table with the actual data (and links to the Nasdaq data.)

Day-by-Day Standouts;

🔸 Monday: The week started an optimism due to some hopes for pausing in tech tariffs especially on smartphones and certain electronics. The indexes lost gains by noon, but it was able to close slightly higher. Citigroup downgrades U.S. equities and set a target value at 5,800 down from the previous estimate of 6,500 due to tariff concerns. This makes it the 3rd brokerages after Goldman Sachs and BofA. 🟢

🔸 Tuesday: The indexes were neutral in the morning. The White House announced two important actions. First one was maintaning its position with Canada. Second one was that China needs to make a deal with the U.S. Additionally, healthcare stocks were under selling pressure due to signals of upcoming tariffs from Trump. By the end of the day, the indexes closed slightly lower. 🔴

🔸 Wednesday: Here we go. Before the session, retail sales data was released and beat expectations. We also heard several new updates about tariffs. The White House is considering increasing the tariff rate on China by 245%. However, China has stated that they open to talks if Trump respects them. Nvidia dropped due to their new H20 chips beings blocked from sale in China. The company's current H100 chips are already banned in there. As a result, the stock dropped more than 7%. This had an effect on the indexes. And the bad news did not stop there. Fed Chair Powell says that ""The Fed will wait on rate cuts"". Of course, the stock market did not like and continued tumbling. The probability of a rate cut in May is below 15% now, but June still shows more than 50% for chance of a 25 point rate cut. The indexes dropped more than 2%. 🔴

🔸 Thursday: The decline did not continue from yesterday. Trump said that had a very productive call with the President of Mexico yesterday. He also said Japan wants to negotiate. These two positive updates effected positively on the stock market. Later on Thursday, Trump said 'He’ll leave. If I ask him to, he’ll be out of there. I don’t think he’s doing the job."" As a result, the indexes lost their gains, but still closed slightly higher. 🟢

Trump believes in lowering rates to reduce inflation. What do you think about this and its effect on the stock market? What will do the Fed or Jerome Powell? How was your week? What's your prediction for next week?

195,NVDA,How much is your portfolio down by?,"Hello all,

I’m curious how everyone’s portfolio is doing, especially with the recent markets volatility. I think knowing how others are doing will help us all feel a little less alone and probably more calm in this uncertain times in the stock market. Please feel free to add as much information as you would like, including % down (or $ amounts), your age, composition of your portfolio (i.e. what industries), largest holdings, any tactical shifts you’re hoping to make/any changes you have made in your portfolio etc as a way to approach the volatility in the markets.

For me, my portfolio is down 25% from all time highs hit in February. 80% of my stocks are in tech, 25% of my portfolio is NVDA. I have been making some tactical shifts, selling some big tech stocks holdings in favor of non-tech names, although I ended up buying UNH (United Healthcare) thinking it’s would be recession-resistant play, and of course the stock dropped 25% yesterday.",118,509,1745017003.0,2025-04-18T22:56:43+00:00,t3_1k2i1uj,stocks
211,NVDA,"Figure AI Shakes Silicon Valley With USD39.5B Valuation, 200,000 Robots Promised By 2029, Beating Out Tesla, SpaceX And OpenAI","Figure AI, a young robotics startup led by serial entrepreneur Brett Adcock, is shaking up Silicon Valley. The company, which promises to revolutionize industries with autonomous robots, is seeking to raise USD1.5 billion at a jaw-dropping USD39.5 billion valuation, according to The Wall Street Journal. 

Founded in 2022, Figure AI set its sights high from the start. Adcock, who previously launched Vettery and Archer Aviation, began by hiring top robotics experts and raising USD70 million in venture capital. In 2023, the company revealed its first humanoid robot, sparking early buzz in the tech community. 

Bloomberg reported that last year, Figure AI announced a massive USD675 million funding round at a USS2.6 billion valuation, attracting investments from Microsoft, OpenAI, Nvidia, and billionaire Jeff Bezos' private firm. 

According to the Journal, Bezos even visited the company's facility, fueling speculation about a potential partnership with Amazon. Talks eventually fell through, but momentum around Figure AI kept growing. 

The major breakthrough came with BMW. Figure's robots are now being tested inside BMW's South Carolina factory. As of this month, multiple humanoid robots are active on-site, performing tasks like picking up and grasping metal sheets, the Journal reported. A BMW announcement confirmed the news, explaining that the robots initially practiced during nonproduction hours and have since transitioned to live-production scenarios. 

Adcock has been vocal about the company's progress. In a Mar 31 social media post featuring the robots at work, he wrote, ""This isn't a test - this is what autonomous robots in production operations look like. Turn the music up!"" 

Figure's ambitions are enormous. The company's documents forecast more than 200,000 robots deployed across factories and homes by 2029, generating USD9 billion in revenue. Such lofty goals are rare for hardware startups, especially considering Figure AI reported no revenue last year and only has a few dozen robots built so far. 

Despite the gap between vision and reality, investor interest has exploded. On Mar 24, Adcock posted that Figure had become the ""#1 most sought-after private stock in the secondary market,"" outranking giants like SpaceX and OpenAI. 

One of the biggest players in the current funding push is Align Ventures. The firm has been working to pool smaller investors.

Still, the excitement around Figure AI continues to build. Adcock's ability to rally capital, attract major investors, and secure a partnership with BMW positions the company as a key player in the race to bring autonomous robots to everyday life. 

While challenges remain, Figure AI is aggressively scaling its efforts. The company is reportedly exploring expansion into logistics and warehousing applications, aiming to broaden the use of its robots beyond automotive factories. Whether Figure AI delivers on its bold promises remains to be seen, but for now, Silicon Valley is watching closely. ",113,43,1744948221.0,2025-04-18T03:50:21+00:00,t3_1k1vs49,StockMarket
196,NVDA,Looking for General Opinions on My NVDL Position,"Hey everyone,

About five weeks ago, I opened a $25K position in NVDL (500 shares at 50.3$) when NVDA was sitting around $125. I’ve always been a pretty cautious investor, but after watching some colleagues pull in strong gains over the past year,I decided to dip my toes in.

This position is about 10% of my overall portfolio, but I’m currently down around 40%. I’m reaching out to get a sense of what others think. I can handle the loss if there’s still a reasonable shot at breaking even or turning a profit, but what’s really been tough is the decay. At this point, NVDA would need to hit around $135 just for me to break even.

Do you think it makes more sense to cut my losses now and switch into NVDA directly, or just ride it out with NVDL? Would appreciate any thoughts or experiences you’re willing to share.",3,20,1744931524.0,2025-04-17T23:12:04+00:00,t3_1k1qi6a,stocks

214,NVDA,Bad news ... but no one can't stop buying !!,"**Hi everyone,**

I see a lot of people stressing out, insulting Trump, warning about a recession, a monetary crisis, or the stock market crash of the century—comparing charts to 1929... But where exactly do you see a recession? Where is the monetary crisis?

The 10-year US Treasury yield has dropped to 4.25%.

I don’t see any crisis—just baseless fear that’s been lingering since 2024. Even back in 2024, people were talking about the return of inflation. There were bets on how many interest rate cuts the Fed would make, and we even ended up with only two cuts. Yet the Nasdaq still rose by 38% in 2024. Even Powell himself says the US economy is extremely strong. March inflation dropped significantly, despite all the doomsday predictions tied to tariffs on Canada and Mexico (which are the two biggest exporters to the US—way ahead of China, and far ahead of Europe).

Employment numbers are excellent: unemployment is at 4.2%. In France, it’s close to 8%, and even that’s a number softened by changes in the calculation methods. In the US, people are earning at least $100K annually. I see regular professionals making $200K a year in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Miami. So seriously, where exactly do you see the recession?

Even with a very negative newsflow, it’s having less and less impact on the stock market. The last scare involving China and Boeing lasted an hour before prices bounced back. Even a dramatic midday speech from Powell isn’t enough to keep the market down till the close—it rebounds more than 1% before the session ends.

Honestly, I wouldn’t even be surprised if we see the S&amp;P 500 above 5400 again tomorrow. This “crisis” is just about market valuation adjustments. Hedge funds and retail investors seem to agree the market has bottomed out and that an S&amp;P 500 in the 5200–5300 range is the floor. Hedge funds aren’t being forced to sell, so they’re not going to crash the S&amp;P 500 and risk triggering margin calls. And retail investors see a $100 Nvidia or an S&amp;P at 5200 as a good opportunity to reload.

So I really have a hard time believing we’re actually in an equity market crisis right now.",0,24,1744846734.0,2025-04-16T23:38:54+00:00,t3_1k0yvbb,StockMarket
199,NVDA,OpenAI Just Showed Nvidia Bear Case Misunderstands the Reality of AI Scaling - $NVDA,"I keep seeing this recurring bearish argument that “more efficient models” like DeepSeek will reduce the need for massive compute, and therefore hurt Nvidia. That thesis simply doesn’t hold up to scrutiny — especially in light of OpenAI’s latest announcement today.

Take a look at the AIME performance chart from OpenAI’s new frontier model (o3). It shows a **direct, consistent correlation between compute usage and model performance**. More compute = better models. Full stop. No tricks, no shortcuts.

[https://imgur.com/a/MU2z77b](https://imgur.com/a/MU2z77b)

Yes, we’re seeing architectural improvements that increase training efficiency. But these gains don’t shrink the pie — **they expand it**. Every efficiency gain is reinvested into building even larger and more capable models. This is the scaling law trend, and Nvidia is at the center of it.

Now to DeepSeek: impressive optimization work, but let’s be real — their model is just riding on top of the massive foundation Nvidia enabled. DeepSeek’s “efficiency” is only relevant because **they still needed access to high-end GPUs to train it in the first place**. No one is training SOTA on CPUs or low-cost commodity hardware. Every frontier model — whether from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or DeepSeek — relies on Nvidia’s stack to get off the ground.

Here’s the bullish reality:

* Model performance still scales with compute — OpenAI just showed us that again.
* Efficient models don’t kill GPU demand; they unlock **even more ambitious models** and **more widespread deployments**.
* Inference is exploding. Every assistant, every copilots, every agent… all of them need sustained GPU access.
* Nvidia has built a full-stack moat: CUDA, TensorRT, networking, and ecosystem lock-in.

The smarter argument isn’t that Nvidia demand will fall — it’s that demand will **explode in more directions**: training, inference, on-device, edge. Efficient models don’t reduce Nvidia’s relevance. They increase the number of use cases and drive **horizontal expansion** of AI compute.",18,33,1744826158.0,2025-04-16T17:55:58+00:00,t3_1k0qunb,stocks

[Gold](https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/investing/article/gold-price-today-wednesday-april-16-2025-gold-opens-with-new-high-134956304.html) has surpassed the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks as the most crowded trade on Wall Street as the precious metal surged to record highs this year amid volatile markets and an uncertain economic backdrop.

According to the latest Bank of America fund managers survey published this week, nearly half of the fund managers surveyed (49%) see long gold, or bets that gold prices will rise, as the most crowded trade in the market right now. This marks the first time in two years that fund managers did not see the Magnificent Seven as Wall Street's most crowded trade, according to the survey.

Gold futures ([GC=F](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GC=F/)) on Wednesday rose to an all-time high of $3,334 as investors continued to [favor the safe-haven asset](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gold-notches-best-week-since-2020-amid-shaken-investor-confidence-in-us-201546983.html) amid a falling US dollar ([DX-Y.NYB](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/DX-Y.NYB/__;!!Op6eflyXZCqGR5I!HIhgXKgPRojUSTTqYlaKSTMqCnabU-_BFJYcQNg1l9bJcllZ1Gp3LtN-1O0pcbknpYvKz0DBczt7-zHHf99GDzXJ1VfxDc7wuw$)) and tariff uncertainty.

Gold prices have surged more than 27% year to date, while the Magnificent Seven tech stocks — Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)), Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL), [GOOG](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG)), Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)), Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)), Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)), Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)), and Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA)) — are down considerably.

Tesla stock has led Magnificent Seven losses and is down about 38% since the start of 2025. Apple stock has fallen 21%.

Nvidia stock has also declined 21% year to date. On Wednesday,[ the AI chip giant warned of a multibillion-dollar ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-dives-as-chipmaker-sees-55-billion-hit-from-surprise-china-chip-controls-130319576.html)impact from US export controls on China, which weighed on shares.

Shares of Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon — the remainder of the Magnificent Seven — are all down by double-digit percentages since the start of the year.

Gold's rally comes as [central banks' demand hit all-time highs](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gold-demand-hits-record-levels-as-central-banks-buy-at-eye-watering-pace-205945413.html) last year and as investors increased inflows into physical gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

""The new highs in gold are signaling a shift in appetite for US assets,"" Ryan McIntyre, senior managing partner at asset manager firm Sprott, recently told Yahoo Finance.

""Confidence in the US has clearly been shaken, so people are looking to diversify.""

311,NVDA,Zoom way out - My Global Investing Thesis,"Let's start with assumptions that I think we can all agree on:

1.  Real power = a nation's ability to influence the behavior of others, shape the global landscape, and advance its interests.

2.  Nations want as much power as possible.  

So here we go.  Forget the small stuff.  Put your ideologies and morals aside.  I think it's become obvious that singular goal of US foreign policy is to isolate or weaken China as much as possible because they are the largest threat to US power.  This confrontation has been building for a long time.  Prior to Trump, we have been trying to isolate China with soft power and influence and most importantly, without Russia's help.  Trump changed this position.  We are now attempting to isolate China with Russian assistance, at least partially.  The US has signaled to Russia that we will align a bit with some of their major interests (withdrawing support from Ukraine and weakening NATO, etc.).  What we want in return is now obvious - help with China.  In general, I believe this will be the overarching theme for the next 10-20 years.  I also think there is a good chance that actual war breaks out during this struggle since it will likely determine which country dominates the globe for the next 50-100 years.  Gross oversimplification, I know.  Just what it looks like to me.    

Investment thesis:

Tech, semiconductors, AI, will suffer from a lot of disruption during the seemingly inevitable US China decoupling in the near term.  They will develop new supply chains and stabilize medium and long term.  Defense stocks also have a bright future.  I believe the US wins the struggle in the end.

# Key Takeaways

* Netflix shares jumped Tuesday after a report company executives laid out ambitious targets at a business review meeting last month.
* The streaming giant aims to double its revenue by 2030 and reach a market capitalization of $1 trillion, *The* *Wall Street Journal* reported Monday.
* Netflix is set to report first-quarter results after the market closes Thursday.

Netflix (NLFX) shares jumped Tuesday following a report company executives laid out ambitious targets at a business review meeting last month.

Executives said the streaming giant aims to double the $39 billion in revenue Netflix brought in last year, with a global ad sales target of $9 billion by 2030, *The* *Wall Street Journal* reported Monday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The streaming giant also aims to reach a [market capitalization](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp) of $1 trillion by 2030, the report said, up from roughly $419.2 billion. The only U.S. companies with a market cap above $1 trillion today include Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B).

Netflix did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Shares were up more than 5% in recent trading Tuesday, leading gains on the S&amp;P 500. They've added about 60% of their value over the past 12 months. (Read *Investopedia's* live coverage of [today's market action here](https://www.investopedia.com/dow-jones-today-04152025-11715325).)

Last week, Morgan Stanley analysts named Netflix a [“top pick,”](https://www.investopedia.com/netflix-a-top-pick-for-morgan-stanley-on-expected-resilience-to-a-weaker-market-11712037) arguing the company could be well-positioned to withstand the current tariff landscape. The streaming giant has shown ""momentum” in its core subscription business, the analysts said. That momentum lowers the company’s overall risk, the bank added, even if the advertising market struggles amid rising trade tensions.

220,NVDA,"Trump Announces Chips, Drug Probes, Opening Door to Tariffs","[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-announces-chips-drug-probes-204108780.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-announces-chips-drug-probes-204108780.html)

(Bloomberg) — President Donald Trump’s administration pressed forward with plans to impose tariffs on semiconductor and pharmaceutical imports by initiating probes led by the Commerce Department.

The moves, announced Monday in the Federal Register, are a precursor to imposing tariffs and threaten to broaden the president’s sweeping US trade war.

The Commerce Department said it would be investigating the impact on US national security of “imports of semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment” as well as “pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical ingredients, including finished drug products” in a pair of notices posted to the Federal Register.

The US president has long decried foreign production of drugs and chips as a threat to national security and threatened to slap tariffs on imports in a bid to revive American manufacturing of those products. But the duties could also wreak havoc on supply chains and drive up costs for Americans.

New levies threaten to roil a chips industry that notched more than $600 billion in global sales of chips essential to products ranging from cars to airplanes and mobile phones to consumer electronics. Semiconductor supply chains still feeling the effect of disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic now could face new strains from the US duties.

The administration’s announcement came days after it exempted semiconductors, mobile phones, computers and other electronics imports from 145% duties applied to China. That announcement was seen as a boon to tech giants like Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp., but Trump and his advisers quickly said the relief would be short lived and that separate levies would be placed on chips.

Tariffs would also be a blow to the world’s largest drugmakers, including Merck &amp; Co. and Eli Lilly &amp; Co., virtually all of which operate scores of manufacturing sites scattered across the globe.

Trump, who has repeatedly bemoaned US drugmakers’ reliance on overseas production, is breaking decades of tradition. The pharmaceutical industry has long side-stepped trade wars, protected by international agreements that largely protected medicines from tariffs on humanitarian grounds.

Trump’s move on semiconductors is similar to the way he’s targeted other sectors, with imported steel, aluminum and automobiles already facing 25% tariffs and an ongoing Commerce Department trade probe expected to result in levies on foreign copper. The president has also vowed tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals and possibly critical minerals.

Under Biden, the US already had doubled tariffs on so-called legacy semiconductors from China to 50% and last December launched a probe into Chinese concentration in the category that sets the stage for Trump to impose even higher levies. While not as advanced as chips driving artificial intelligence, the older technology is ubiquitous in autos, airplanes, medical devices and telecommunications.

Trump has cast reshoring chipmaking and revitalizing the US industrial base as essential for the nation’s security. Winning a global race to dominate the AI industry is also a top Trump administration priority. Analysts have warned that bringing chip manufacturing to the US will take years of hard work work.

**Worldwide Impact**

The move on medicines will have an outsize effect on Ireland, with a $54 billion (€47.6 billion) trade surplus with the US that helped spur Trump’s wrath. The imbalance, heavily weighted by the pharmaceutical industry, stems from the country’s favorable tax regime and highly educated workforce. US drug companies, including Lilly and Pfizer Inc., operate nearly two dozen factories in Ireland that ship drugs to the US, according to a TD Cowen analysis.

The US biotech industry, which drives much of the innovation in drug development, is also vulnerable to the new tariffs. Nearly 90% of American companies rely on imported components for US-approved products, according to a recent survey by the Biotechnology Innovation Organization. As a result, the supply of medicines for US patients and families are particularly vulnerable to proposed tariffs on the European Union, China and Canada, the group wrote.

Nearly all of the companies surveyed said they expect manufacturing costs to surge if import tariffs are placed on the European Union. Half of the 42 companies said they’d be forced to scramble for new research and manufacturing partners or they’d need to rework or potentially delay regulatory filings for new products.

“Re-onshoring key parts of the biotechnology supply chain to the U.S. and our allies and strengthening the American manufacturing base should be a high priority for both national and economic security,” BIO President John Crowley said in a statement. “It will take years, though, for this shift. We need to be mindful of the negative consequences of these proposed tariffs.”

**Trump’s Exemptions**

The US president earlier Monday announced he would consider temporary reprieves from his 25% tariff on automotive imports to allow companies time to bring production to the US.

The announcement suggested that the president was willing to negotiate with industry leaders, and a similar push from technology and pharmaceutical executives is almost certain to follow.

“He’s going to get this onshoring to happen as soon as possible and as orderly as possible,” Trump economic adviser Kevin Hassett said Monday on Fox Business. “And so when he talks to CEOs and they say, ‘Hey, I need a little more time with this, I need a little time more more time with that,’ then he’s absolutely willing to listen. And if he’s convinced, then he’ll make the call to do something like he did today.”

Trump was asked what short-lived product exclusions he was considering but did not specify how long a potential pause or lowering of auto levies would remain in place.",13,4,1744665472.0,2025-04-14T21:17:52+00:00,t3_1jzabl0,StockMarket

222,NVDA,Today Trump Wakes Up to a Green Market. Bulls Might Regret It.,"

Don’t be surprised if Trump wakes up tomorrow, sees the market green, and thinks: “Guess I didn’t scare them enough.”

No one really reacted to his half-denial about removing tariffs on chips, semiconductors, and computers which, let’s be honest, sounded more like confusion than policy. If anything, it only made things murkier. And when Trump gets ignored, what does he usually do? Doubles down. More tariffs? Wouldn’t be shocking.

Meanwhile, China just pulled the plug on rare earth exports. You know, the critical materials needed to make every chip, missile, EV, and iPhone. Trump tried to get Ukraine to help supply these metals last year. It didn’t work. And China knows exactly how vital this is to U.S. tech dominance.

All major tech players from NVIDIA to Apple rely on these resources. So yes, while the market is green for now, don’t mistake silence for safety. This might be the setup — not the relief.

Bulls are walking into a trap with smiles on their faces.
I hope some of you at least get out with a profit before the hammer drops.

Good luck everyone.

224,NVDA,What should we expect from the markets on Monday after Trump suspended tariffs on smartphones and laptops?,"On Friday, the Trump administration announced a temporary suspension of tariffs on several key electronic products, including smartphones, laptops, memory chips, and other consumer tech items. These products were initially subject to tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese imports, in addition to a general 10% global tariff.

The official reason cited was to avoid passing excessive costs onto U.S. consumers and to reduce pressure on major American tech firms—particularly those heavily reliant on Asian manufacturing, like Apple and Nvidia.

While markets reacted positively late on Friday, with a modest rebound in tech stocks, the bigger question is: what happens next?
	•	Could this lead to a broader tech-led recovery in the coming days?
	•	Or will uncertainty around future sector-specific tariffs (as hinted by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick) limit any upside?
	•	What are the likely short-term impacts on supply chains and investor sentiment?

Some sectors to watch might include semiconductors, consumer electronics, and companies with significant China exposure.

Do you think this is just a temporary boost or the start of a more sustained rally? And which specific stocks or ETFs are you watching closely because of this shift?",10,71,1744571736.0,2025-04-13T19:15:36+00:00,t3_1jyfiwh,StockMarket
312,NVDA,"Markets on the Line: Trump Dials, China Breathes, Retail Buys the Top","Three Roads Diverged in a Red Market
By Someone Who’s Been Burned Enough to Know Better

Let’s look into the week ahead. A week that promises to be how shall I put this gently? a complete circus, economically speaking. Three scenarios are forming, and all of them are… deeply unserious with serious consequences.

Scenario 1: The Phantom Deal

On Monday, Trump finally gets Beijing on the line. The conversation?
Static. Silence. Heavy breathing.
The Chinese delegation says nothing. Possibly because they’re muted, possibly because they’re laughing. Either way, Trump hangs up, declares it a historic victory, and rushes to the podium:
“They answered. We made a deal. Tremendous deal. Tariffs coming down. You’re welcome.”

No one else was on the call. Not even the NSA.
But the market, running on hopium and Robinhood notifications, surges.
For 48 hours.

Then the peasants i.e., retail investors, grandmas with E*TRADE, and that guy in your office who keeps refreshing his Fidelity app during meetings realize they’ve been had. Again.
The rally fades. Sell-offs begin.



Scenario 2: Tariff Ragnarok

Trump reads a thread on Reddit. Someone calls him soft.
That’s it. That’s the trigger.

He goes full Game of Thrones.
“1 billion percent tariffs on everything from China. Toothbrushes. LEDs. Birthday candles. Tariffed.”

He says:
“Before I even think about easing tariffs, Xi Jinping has to kiss me on the ass twice. Once for America, once for the DJIA.”

Markets tank. Semiconductor stocks cry. Apple tries to rebrand as Canadian.
Gold spikes. Bitcoin goes into a manic episode.
Even the Fed just shrugs and mutters, “He’s doing it again.”



Scenario 3: Sleepy Sunday, Stupid Monday

Sunday night. No news.
But Friday’s tariff panic is still echoing.
Cue the late sleepers: peasants who read Barron’s on Saturday but took melatonin Sunday.

They log in at 5:59 PM ET.
Buy NVDA and APPL like it’s Coachella tickets.
The market jumps.

Then Trump strolls out after the market opens Monday.
Big grin. Big words. Announces:
“We’re lifting tariffs on semiconductors.”

The market flies. Tech bros fist bump.
But wait 2 hours later, the USTR drops a press release:
“Tariffs are increasing on pharmaceutical imports.”
Markets flatten. Analysts confused. Reddit crashes.
It’s chaos, but controlled.


So where are we headed?

Somewhere between delusion and diplomatic improv.

Peasants will buy the dip, hedge funds will sell the bounce, and everyone will pretend to know what’s going on until Wednesday.

And just remember there’s no such thing as too late in a market built on make-believe.


❗️Update:

Additional Scenario (worth watching):

There’s another angle I initially missed — and it might flip the board on Monday.

Word is spreading fast about a potential insider trading investigation tied to last week’s suspicious pre-announcement activity. One name already floating: Marjorie Taylor Greene. If this gains traction, we may see a sharp reversal Monday — not because the fundamentals changed, but because someone has to be sacrificed.

Think of it this way:
Friday’s pump gave insiders a clean exit. If they’re under heat now, the easiest way to diffuse the narrative is to make the market dump. That way, no one “benefited.”

“See? No one knew anything. Look, everyone lost.”

Classic damage control.

So while everyone’s positioned long, thinking they’re riding institutional momentum, we might actually be walking into a controlled demolition to cover tracks.

Stay paranoid. The real play might be in the misdirection.",39,26,1744569390.0,2025-04-13T18:36:30+00:00,t3_1jyelx4,StockMarket

I had the same question that ""Is the worst behind us?"" in March 15. The S&amp;P 500 closed 5,638.94 that week. And today, it has closed at 5,358.75. But this time, could it be different?

It has been a busy week, and also a highly volatile one. The S&amp;P500's daily closing percentages were -0.23%, -1.57%, +9.52%, -3.46%, +1.72%.

Day-by-Day Standouts;

🔸 Monday: Last week, we saw major losses after the tariff announcements. Asian markets opened with heavy selling pressure. The Hang Seng Index dropped 13% in a single day. Thailand temporarily banned short selling of stocks. This week started under similar pressure. Althouth there was no major news for the market, but it rebounded and recovered more than 3% its loses. The day ended slightly negative. 🔴

🔸 Tuesday: U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said, ""Up to 70 nations want to negotiate over Trump's tariffs"". This boosted the market and opened up by around 2.5%. However, the momentum could not continue. The White House later announced that Trump is not considering any extensions or delays. All gains were erased and the market dropped more than 1.5% 🔴

🔸 Wednesday: Here we go. The stock market opened slightly lower and then came big news. Trump signaled a 90-day pause on tariffs, but China's tariff rate will jump to 125%. The stock market focused on the first part and made a huge jump and gained more than 10%. What a day. 🟢

🔸 Thursday: CPI inflation was released and came in below expectations, but investors remembered China's tarrifs and took profits. The stock market lost more than 3%. 🔴

🔸 Friday: PPI inflation had released and similar to CPI, it came below expectations. The monthly expectation was 0.2%, but it came -0.4%. This result caused to the yearly rate to drop to 2.7%. The yearly dropped below 3% since November 2024. This is very positive for the stock market because it increases the chances of more rate cuts. The first one could come in May, but prohability is still low. On the negative side, The US10Y (10-year treasury) hit 4.60 and the highest level since Feb. 13.

317,NVDA,"[Insider Trading] Data Analysis for April 10, 2025 (Last 12 Hours) in the Context of Global Markets and Sector Performance","# Market Context

Global markets experienced a significant sell-off on April 10, 2025:

      * **Total**: Approximately $1.16 million.
      * **Note**: While web results mention a CFO sale on March 29, 2025 (outside our window), these transactions are assumed to fall within the last 12 hours based on the provided data.
      * **Implication**: Coordinated sales by top executives suggest caution, possibly due to sector headwinds or company-specific concerns.
   * **Cloudflare (NET)**: CEO Matthew Prince sold $249,015 and an additional $16 million in stock:
      * **Total**: Approximately $16.25 million.
      * **Implication**: This substantial sale could indicate profit-taking or unease about further sector declines, though it may also reflect a pre-planned trading schedule.
   * **Asana (ASAN)**: CEO Dustin Moskovitz bought shares in two transactions:
      * $6.7 million and $6.72 million.
      * **Total**: Approximately $13.42 million.
      * **Implication**: This significant purchase signals strong confidence in Asana’s future, viewing the sector’s sell-off as a buying opportunity.

# Energy Sector

* **Market Performance**: Energy stocks declined sharply (e.g., XOM -5.55%, CVX -7.57%).
* **Insider Activity**:
   * **CVR Energy (CVI)**: Activist investor Carl Icahn acquired 665,449 shares from April 8 to April 10, 2025, totaling approximately $11.1 million:
      * **Specific to April 10**: The portion of this purchase on April 10 falls within the 12-hour window (exact breakdown unspecified but confirmed active on this date per web results).
      * **Context**: CVR Energy’s stock has dropped over 50% in the past year, positioning it as a potential value play.
      * **Implication**: Icahn’s contrarian buy suggests he sees upside potential, possibly anticipating a sector recovery or company-specific catalysts.

# Consumer Cyclical Sector

* **Market Performance**: The sector weakened, with stocks like TSLA declining 7.27%.
* **Insider Activity**:
   * **Rush Street Interactive (RSI)**: Multiple insiders sold shares:
      * CEO Richard Schwartz: Sold $2.06 million.
      * CIO Einar Roosileht: Sold $111,600.
      * COO Mattias Stetz: Sold $14,676.
      * **Total**: Approximately $2.19 million.
      * **Implication**: These sales align with sector struggles, potentially reflecting concerns about consumer spending or industry-specific risks.

# Other Notable Transactions

* **Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings (CCO) - Communication Services**: Insider Arturo Moreno bought $1.73 million:
   * **Implication**: Optimism about advertising recovery or company growth amid sector declines (e.g., META -6.74%).
* **Gamestop (GME) - Consumer Cyclical**: Director Alain Attal bought $257,500:
   * **Implication**: Suggests belief in a potential rebound or undervaluation.
* **RenovoRx (RNXT) - Healthcare**: VP Controller Ronald Kocak and CMO Agah Ramtin bought shares totaling \~$34,399:
   * **Implication**: Modest buys in a smaller-cap biotech indicate confidence amid mixed sector performance.

# Key Insights and Implications

1. **Technology Sector**: Mixed signals emerge, with significant sells at Phreesia and Cloudflare indicating caution, contrasted by Asana’s large buy suggesting selective optimism. The sector’s 4-7% declines may reflect valuation concerns or macroeconomic pressures, but Asana’s CEO sees value.
2. **Energy Sector**: Icahn’s $11.1 million purchase of CVR Energy stock (partially on April 10) is a standout contrarian move. With the sector down sharply and CVR Energy off 50% in the past year, this buy could signal a bet on recovery or activist strategy.
3. **Consumer Cyclical Sector**: Insider sales at Rush Street Interactive reinforce the sector’s weakness, hinting at worries about consumer demand or competitive pressures.
4. **Extended Time Window**: Shifting from 10:00 AM PDT (1:00 PM EST) to 18:30 PDT extends the analysis by 8.5 hours, potentially capturing more transactions. For instance, Icahn’s April 10 purchase is confirmed within this period, while earlier transactions (e.g., “16 minutes ago” from 13:00 PDT) remain relevant if within the 06:30-18:30 PDT range.
5. **Volatility Context**: The VIX at 43.99 highlights market uncertainty. Sells in struggling sectors may reflect risk aversion, while buys could indicate insiders exploiting perceived overreactions.

# Conclusion

As of 18:30 PDT on April 10, 2025, insider trading activity over the last 12 hours reveals a cautious stance in Technology and Consumer Cyclical sectors, with significant sells at Phreesia, Cloudflare, and Rush Street Interactive aligning with their sectors’ poor performance. Conversely, notable buys in Technology (Asana) and Energy (CVR Energy) suggest some insiders see value amid the sell-off. With the VIX at 43.99 signaling high volatility, investors should weigh these insider signals carefully alongside broader market trends. The updated time frame to 18:30 PDT broadens the scope of transactions considered, reinforcing the mixed sentiment in this turbulent market environment.",7,11,1744335292.0,2025-04-11T01:34:52+00:00,t3_1jweej4,StockMarket

226,NVDA,The Latest from NYT,"U.S. stocks tumbled about 3 percent in afternoon trading on Thursday as investors assessed the worsening trade war with China, and President Trump clarified that he had raised tariffs on Chinese goods by a total of 145 percent since taking office.

There were other alarming signs on Thursday: In the government bond market, U.S. Treasuries started to sell off again, with the yield on 10-year Treasuries climbing to 4.37 percent, the highest since February. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index dropped nearly 7 percent, with shares in Apple, Nvidia and other tech giants falling. And oil prices fell about 4 percent, trading below $63 a barrel.

Together, the signals pointed toward a mood shift since Wednesday afternoon, when the markets cheered Mr. Trump’s decision to postpone many of his tariff plans for three months.

The Trump administration appeared unmoved. “I don’t see anything unusual,” Scott Bessent, the Treasury secretary, told reporters, referring to recent market activity.

On Thursday, the White House put out a statement making it clear the 125 percent import tax on China announced on Wednesday was in addition to a 20 percent tariff Mr. Trump had already imposed on China for its role in supplying fentanyl and its precursors in the United States. He also left in place new tariffs on automobiles, steel and aluminum.

While tensions between Beijing and Washington showed no signs of easing, the European Union responded to Mr. Trump’s decision to put off implementing a hefty import tax on its goods by announcing it would also delay its retaliatory tariffs on U.S. imports for 90 days.

The three-month delay on most country-specific tariffs did not temper the concerns of many economists who cautioned that the full repercussions from the trade war between Washington and Beijing would not be felt for weeks.

A report released on Thursday showed that U.S. inflation eased more than expected in March, providing what economists say is likely to be only a temporary reprieve before Mr. Trump’s tariffs are expected to reignite price pressures.

The Consumer Price Index climbed 2.4 percent last month from a year earlier. That data covered a period before the majority of Mr. Trump’s tariffs — including the most recent ones on China — went into effect. And despite the reprieve for some nations, economists have been warning that the tariffs now in place will still prove costly, not only leading to slower growth but also higher inflation.

Here’s what else to know:

U.S.-China tensions: Mr. Trump suggested on Wednesday that he was waiting to hear from China’s leader, Xi Jinping, so the two could broker a deal. China has said it is willing to hold talks, but not under duress. “China wants to make a deal,” Mr. Trump said. “They just don’t know quite how to go about it.”

E.U. pause: Mr. Trump’s reversal prompted the European Union to put its new tariffs on hold in order “to give negotiations a chance,” said Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, though she warned that the tariffs would take effect if talks “are not satisfactory.”

Farmers react: The loss of China as an export market will deal a particularly hard economic blow to agricultural workers in many red states, hitting many of the voters who helped Mr. Trump win the presidential election. “If this lasts long term, we’re going to have a significant number of farmers going out of business,” said Caleb Ragland, a Kentucky farmer who is president of the American Soybean Association.  

Republican nerves: Some Republican lawmakers, caught between their deep opposition to tariffs and fear of criticizing Mr. Trump, have cheered his 90-day reprieve on higher tariffs for most countries.

“Tariffs will be negotiated away. Buy as much stocks as possible!

Everyone here is panicking and thinking these tariffs are going to destroy everything. It’s not an incorrect thought… IF they stay in effect for a long period. 

However it’s important to listen to what Trump has said. Trump said he’s open to tarrif cuts if countries offer something phenomenal. He also said now these countries will be coming to us to negotiate rather than the other way around. He used tik tok as an example to say he may cut tarrif on china to close a tik tok deal. 

Trump put these tariffs in effect to give him huge leverage over every country. He even bragged that every country has called him to negotiate. Acting tough like the tariffs will be in place for a few years, is ONLY to increase their leverage. The more difficult it seems to remove tariffs the more negotiating power Trump has. 

This is a rare stock crash where it’s completely self inflicted with the signing of a pen from the president. This means to end this pain will ONLY take the president to end the tariffs- which can be done instantly. 

I am very sure this will be exactly like the Covid crash. He will keep talking a big talk and more and more terrible news will come out. But then there will be cracks as exceptions are made and deals are negotiated. This is literally the man who wrote “Art of the Deal”. He is 100% transactional and is always aiming to make a deal.

Personally I am buying AI stocks like crazy. This is probably the last chance to get on the AI boat before this stuff rockets. SMH, ASML, NVDA, AMZN META—- all these big tech names will come out fine long term. No matter how scary it gets just keep buying. “",0,62,1744231775.0,2025-04-09T20:49:35+00:00,t3_1jvgeuy,stocks

231,NVDA,A diminished ‘Magnificent 7’ tests Big Tech’s role in the market,"Even before the stock market strapped into the tariff roller coaster, [Big Tech was on a bumpy ride](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-magnificent-7-stocks-are-having-their-worst-quarter-in-more-than-2-years-190335944.html?fr=sycsrp_catchall). The start of the year coincided with an unwinding of the AI trade.

Trillion-dollar tickers composing the Magnificent Seven devolved from Wall Street’s jet fuel into dead weight. Some forecasters lowered their S&amp;P 500 year-end levels, [weighed down by the leaden baggage](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tech-stock-momentum-is-hiding-behind-the-cloud-of-tariffs-morning-brief-100013159.html) of the “Maleficent Seven,"" including the massive costs of AI development, Deepseek’s surprise success, and what (at the time) was the looming threat of new levies.

But as the AI trade cooled, the Magnificent Seven still tracked the growth trajectory of the market, even accounting for their concentration in the S&amp;P 500. It wasn’t (and still isn’t) a controversial thing to say that many of the valuations of the largest companies were inflated by a combination of AI mania, FOMO trading, and the animal spirits wafting around talk of a soft landing.

Fast-forward a few weeks and several panicked trading sessions later, and the Magnificent Seven has been cut down to size. But [the relief that arrived this week](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-leads-magnificent-7-rebound-after-tariff-fueled-sell-off-125402604.html), though fleetingly measured in hours on Tuesday, highlighted just how important these stocks remain, [even in their diminished state](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/a-diminished-magnificent-7-tests-big-techs-role-in-the-market-morning-brief-095913449.html).",23,1,1744197556.0,2025-04-09T11:19:16+00:00,t3_1jv3b7k,StockMarket

This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

We've had a minor bounce today from the multiple country individual panics on Monday, so today is mainly focused on finding stocks that have bounced that haven't bounced too strongly yet compared to others (mainly due to the exposure to tariffs they have compared to other companies).

Tickers are ordered from most risk and exposure to tariffs to least. **The next big catalyst I'm waiting for is an actual tariff response with numbers from China (because they haven't given firm numbers beyond vowing retaliation)**

News: [US Stock Futures Rise As Dip Buyers Emerge After Selloff](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-08/us-stock-futures-rise-as-dip-buyers-emerge-after-selloff)

[**BABA (BABA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&amp;p=d)/JD/FXI/other Chinese companies- China hasn't budged on the tariffs at all and signaled that they are going to ""fight until the end"" after Trump threatens 50% additional tariffs.

[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&amp;p=d)\- Mainly looking at this due to AAPL being the most exposed of the MAG7 due to iPhones accounting for \~50% of the company's revenue, we're 20% down from pre-tariff announcements, arguably this is one of my favorite candidates once we DO resolve tariffs to turn. 

[**CAT (Caterpillar)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CAT&amp;p=d)/[**SWK (Stanley Black &amp; Decker)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SWK&amp;p=d)\- Industry overlap in tools/equipment and having major manufacturing in China, CAT has far more exposure in China and is also arguably a more defensive stock despite being in line with housing/other infrastructure spending. (but also note that we're only 10% down from pre-tariff prices)

[**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&amp;p=d)\- Something that surprised me was the strength of NVDA selling off (I know that input costs will be the reason for inevitable rise in costs, despite Taiwanese chips being exempt from tariffs). Overall am still long from OVERNIGHT on Sunday night but still interested in any levels below $100 if we sell off today (but that's dependent on what we do at the time). 

[**VXX (ProShares VIX)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VXX&amp;p=d)\- VXX spiked to 85 yesterday premarket, wasn't able to really short at a meaningful price or size so will stay away unless we have more volatility from China come in. China is the next ""catalyst"" I'm waiting on.

[**MSTR (MicroStrategy)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MSTR&amp;p=d)\- (This is unrelated to tariffs overall) The underlying holdings are starting to get close to the cost basis they have- their average cost is around $67.5K, and it's currently trading at $80K- at that point we may see something trade closer to NAV.

Meanwhile, 10-year bond yields rising from around 4.00% to 4.20%. Could this mean investors believe that we're nearing the dip? The market was expecting the first rate cut in June, but May percentage are increasing.

235,NVDA,Markets are Crashing - Here are the Safest MAG7 Stocks to Buy According to Their Valuations,"Of course with the tariffs, no equities are 100% safe but the current environment also creates a buying opportunity. I used to be an investment banking analyst and wanted to provide some perspective with numbers on which of the MAG7 stocks are trading at fair valuations.

The pictured chart is a trading comps analysis of key growth and profitability metrics, EBITDA multiples, and how much of a discount today's current multiples are to the average of the past 1, 2, 5 years.

**Trading comps are a simple analysis but if it's new to you, here's how to look at it:**

* EV / EBITDA multiples
   * Low = cheaper (green)
   * High = more expensive (red)
* Premium (Discount) to Historical Multiples
   * More negative (green) = trading at a discount vs historical multiples meaning the companies used to be trading at higher multiples
   * Less negative or positive (red) = trading at a premium meaning the companies used to be trading at lower multiples

**Key takeaways as of 4/7/25 1:30PM EST trading numbers:**

1. **NVIDIA** is trading pretty fairly considering it has the highest growth and margins while trading at the same 2026 EBITDA multiple (14.2x) of Microsoft (14.5x)
2. **Alphabet and META** are also solid buys considering similar growth, margins, and multiples
3. **Tesla** is extremely overpriced considering decent growth but low margins

To be clear, I know there are a lot of macro factors that mean things can change very quickly and the recent tariffs are more harmful to some of these companies than others.

So point of this post is not to say ""buy these stocks because these numbers say so"" because there's so much more to investing than just valuation. Instead, given all the things happening in the markets, I wanted to provide one tool for your potential buying decisions as you do your own analysis.

Hope this helps!",0,2,1744051211.0,2025-04-07T18:40:11+00:00,t3_1jtsqsq,StockMarket

Here is my play, Trump has announced he will be adding additonal 50% tariffs on China tomorrow which means they will be above 100% tariffs. China buys a lot of Nvidia chips which means these will get much more expensive for them.

This means, it won’t last. It’s a switch. If turned off, we’ll see so much green that our eyes will turn blue. 

People in this group kept asking which stocks to buy, and asking for advice as most stocks were very expensive. Literally so many stocks even value stocks like $MKC who is a value stock, was priced 6 years out with growth. $MKC had a P/E of 28 and growth rate of 1-3% yearly. 

Finally; this creates an opportunity for cheap stocks. If you even dare, buy call options 1-2 years out. 

I purchased $CLF $10 call options, that are out till 2027. Many other call options will be added Monday. This opportunity is one I’ll be telling my kids about when they ask me how we got so rich. 

If you’re a similar thinker like me, I’d love to hear some names you’re going to buy. Drop them in the comments, and a very short DD would be appreciated. I have lots of cash on the sidelines, would love to start utilizing it.

216,NVDA,"Convince me not be a bear now, Part 3.","[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iu1jy7/convince_me_i_shouldnt_be_a_bear_now/) Feb 20. Positions: Spy puts, short. 

[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jckrcz/convince_me_i_shouldnt_be_a_bear_now_pt_2/) March 17. Positions: Cash + protectionist plays (INTC, X, etc). 

Well, this ended up becoming a little trilogy. The market has went down, a lot, and the big question is: 

Is this time to buy?

I think so. I have been, over Thursday and Friday. 

Why?

1. Because these tariffs are bad. They are so bad that, if unchanged, they will cause not only a recession, but I think there will be riots on the streets within 6 months. 

2. Trump -- and the republican party -- are on a timer. Midterms are next year. They need to show results, not a crashing economy. Republicans are already starting to voice discontent. Ted Cruz *openly* stated this could be a ""political bloodbath"". If tariffs stay on, republicans will break ranks. Anything else is political suicide. 

3. This leads me to conclude that tariffs will be removed. Either via Trump or through congressional action. Maybe even impeachment. The result? Markets moon. 

This leads me to 3 scenarios: 

1. Tariffs end quickly via renegotiation or Trump just backing down. I mean, islands with penguins? Seriously? Trump declares victory.

2. Some tariffs (China) stay, many others are removed. Certain industries benefit, others feel pain.

3. Tariffs stay on long enough to necessitate public/congressional intervention. Political chaos, recession, Maga goose cooked.

In scenario 1 and 2, damage is limited and markets ascend quickly. Remember, most gains come from certain days. 
In scenario 3, damage includes a recession. Earnings go down and valuations may retreat to ~16, which is ~4400 on the S&amp;P. We are at 5070 now.

I'm deploying 80% of cash to buy. Keeping 20% safe, just in case.

So far, I've bought financials (KRE, WAL), tech (INTC, NVDA, META), retailers (NKE, RH) and SPY. Also, some LCID and RKLB for funsies. 

Is this the low? I don't know. China and the EU can wait Trump out, I think. Standing up to Trump and tariffs will be domestically popular for them. Which means they will not renegotiate. Which means action must come from the US. 

But, sitting on cash for too long is foolish, unless you live in Omaha. Spy has already fallen from 613 in Feb when I went short; and from 560 in March when I went cash. Things are now a lot more attractive. 

To summarize my theory, I hope that the adults in Washington step up, stop executive overreach, and we all benefit. It might take some time. I suggest writing to your representatives in Congress. I have.

Surprisingly, this move is a real ""expectation breaker for many"". I'm sure many are still short MSTR as well in the idea that eventually it will follow the general market. However, what I'm seeing is something completely differently.....it's getting bought up by bigger players. 

In a long time, the last 2 sessions were amongst the worst. Yet, MSTR and BTC is up on a net basis. That's massive relative strength and shouldn't be ignored. 

I'm yet to take a long position here but just because the market is weak wouldn't stop me from going long MSTR if it continues to show strength. 

Yes, horrible market however, this also the exact time to scan for stocks holding up. Eventually money will rotate into them. On top of this, bear market rallies tends to be the strongest and quickest.

Don't worry too much dear friend... the market will bounce back... but probably without your longs which have been decimated... really sorry in advance.

The market just got absolutely wrecked over the last two days. **S&amp;P 500 down nearly 10%**, **Nasdaq officially in a bear market**, and **the Dow suffering its worst drop since 2020**. China hit back at Trump’s tariffs with a **34% levy on all U.S. imports**, and Wall Street is panicking.

With this kind of crash, you have to wonder—**did a major hedge fund or market maker just get wiped out?** A 10% drop in the indices means billions in losses, and if any fund was leveraged long, they could be **completely blown up**.

Here’s what’s wild:

* **Apple -7%, Nvidia -7%, Tesla -10%, Boeing -9%, Caterpillar -6%**—these are massive institutional holdings, and they got *destroyed*.
* **Only 14 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 closed green. FOURTEEN.**
* **The VIX is over 40**, which is basically screaming panic mode. (TIME TO BUY ? Where is your blood on the street account ???)
* **Bonds are ripping because everyone’s running for safety.**
* **China isn’t just slapping tariffs—they’re adding U.S. firms to their ‘unreliable entities list’ and launching antitrust probes.**

If any hedge fund was heavily exposed to tech, running options, or using leverage, they might be **gone**. A $200M loss for one fund? Honestly, that might be *lowballing* it.

We’ve seen this movie before—Archegos, LTCM, Melvin Capital. Who’s getting margin-called next? Any guesses on which fund is about to be in the headlines?

&gt;Okay, I'll stop trolling.

We talked a lot about the April 2 tariffs. The stock market had already priced them in and made a 3-day winning streak for the S&amp;P 500 at the beginning of the week. However, no one expected heavy new tariffs.

Day-by-Day Standouts;

🔸 Monday: The week started with selling pressure due to expectations that tariffs would target all countries. Later in the day, the tariffs would be sector-based rather than country-based. This news helped indexes recover and they gained around 0.5%. 🟢

🔸 Tuesday: A quiet day. The market awaited more tariff details, but indexes managed to stay on the positive side. 🟢

🔸 Wednesday: For the second time this week, indexes opened lower following the ADP Payroll Report, but recovered again ahead of the ‘Liberation Day’ events after market close. Indexes gained over 0.5%. 🟢

🔸 Thursday: Trump announced heavy tariffs on all countries. This was unexpected and triggered a strong wave of selling. All indexes lost over 5%. 🔴

🔸 Friday: Before the market opened, China announced an additional 34% tariff increase on U.S. goods. Later, Fed Chair Jerome Powell spoke that the Fed wants to observe the impact of tariffs on prices and inflation. The market didn’t respond well and selling pressure intensified. 🔴

Before today, the stock market was expecting the first rate cut in June and also they was expecting four rate cuts for this year. This outlook might now change. Money had gone into 10-year bonds and yields down to 4%. Meanwhile, JPMorgan raised its recession probability to 60%.

In the afternoon, Trump commented on China’s response.

""China played it wrong. They panicked, the one thing they can’t afford to do!""

Do you agree with JPMorgan? Are we heading toward a recession? How do you see China's reaction and Trump's comment? How was your week? Did you open any short positions or earn from bonds? I didn’t make any trades this week. What’s your prediction for next week?

**AVGO, NXPI, LRCX, AMAT- ALL OF THESE COMPANIES HAVE 20%+ OF THEIR SALES COME FROM CHINA)**\- China imposing a 34% tariff on US imports escalates trade tensions and impacts supply chains, all of which have significant exposure to China. Overall, most interested in NVDA at $95/$90 and possibly INTC at $20 if we don't spike off the open. I'm leaning more bearish for today due to the news being announced so early premarket from China, and also from the fear of the US announcing additional tariffs.

[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&amp;p=d)\- AAPL broke $200 premarket following the announcement- mainly due to approximately 20% of AAPL revenue comingfrom China.

AAPL relies heavily on China for manufacturing, with over 90% of its production based there and newly imposed tariffs are expected to increase AAPL’s annual costs by $8.5B. China adding more tariffs affects AAPL as it is clearly the biggest MAG7 loser of the tariffs.

219,NVDA,Tariffs will be negotiated away. Buy as much stocks as possible!,"Everyone here is panicking and thinking these tariffs are going to destroy everything. It’s not an incorrect thought… IF they stay in effect for a long period. 

However it’s important to listen to what Trump has said. Trump said he’s open to tarrif cuts if countries offer something phenomenal. He also said now these countries will be coming to us to negotiate rather than the other way around. He used tik tok as an example to say he may cut tarrif on china to close a tik tok deal. 

Trump put these tariffs in effect to give him huge leverage over every country. He even bragged that every country has called him to negotiate. Acting tough like the tariffs will be in place for a few years, is ONLY to increase their leverage. The more difficult it seems to remove tariffs the more negotiating power Trump has. 

This is a rare stock crash where it’s completely self inflicted with the signing of a pen from the president. This means to end this pain will ONLY take the president to end the tariffs- which can be done instantly. 

I am very sure this will be exactly like the Covid crash. He will keep talking a big talk and more and more terrible news will come out. But then there will be cracks as exceptions are made and deals are negotiated. This is literally the man who wrote “Art of the Deal”. He is 100% transactional and is always aiming to make a deal.

Personally I am buying AI stocks like crazy. This is probably the last chance to get on the AI boat before this stuff rockets. SMH, ASML, NVDA, AMZN META—- all these big tech names will come out fine long term. No matter how scary it gets just keep buying. ",0,139,1743764635.0,2025-04-04T11:03:55+00:00,t3_1jr96m5,stocks

220,NVDA,"Apple sheds $300 billion in tariff-fueled sell-off, on track for worst drop since March 2020","[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-sheds-300-billion-in-tariff-fueled-sell-off-on-track-for-worst-drop-since-march-2020-175727479.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-sheds-300-billion-in-tariff-fueled-sell-off-on-track-for-worst-drop-since-march-2020-175727479.html)

Tech stocks plummeted on Thursday, with Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)) leading ""Magnificent Seven"" names lower following President Trump's[ reciprocal tariff announcement](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-every-country-facing-reciprocal-tariffs-announced-by-trump-on-liberation-day-231329935.html) the day prior.

Shares of Apple, on track for their worst day since March 2020, cratered over 8% in afternoon trade as the stock erased $300 billion from its market cap. The largest risk, according to analysts, centers on the iPhone maker's overseas production hubs, which are particularly vulnerable to the tariffed countries.

On Wednesday, Trump announced tariffs that will impact some 185 countries, including the United States's largest trading partners. Additional reciprocal tariffs, for instance, will include 34% tariffs on Chinese imports, a 20% tariff on European Union imports, a 46% tariff on imports from Vietnam, 32% on imports from Taiwan, and 26% on India — all set to take effect on April 9.

Notably, the additional 34% tax on China will be added to the country's existing 20% tariff, meaning its total tariff rate will rise to 54%. China is Apple's most important [production hub](https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-cook-apple-supply-chain-trump-tariffs-china-diversify-iphone-2025-1?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=yahoo.com), with about 85% of its iPhones manufactured there.

""Apple produces basically all their iPhones in China, and the question will be around exceptions and exemptions on this tariff policy if those companies are building more operations, factories, and plants in the US[ like Apple announced in February](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-will-spend-more-than-500-billion-usd-in-the-us-over-the-next-four-years/),"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to clients following the announcement.

As trade tensions escalate, Apple has moved to increase its supply chain beyond just China, boosting manufacturing in places like India and Vietnam. But with the new tariff announcements set to impact those countries too, there's now limited room for reprieve.

""The worry will be around pricing and margin impacts along with what this means for the global supply chain looking forward,"" Ives said. For now, the analyst continues to believe major negotiations will happen over the coming months as companies attempt to navigate ""this new world of tariffs.""

Until then, he warned, ""tech stocks will clearly be under major pressure.""

Other Magnificent Seven players also faced significant selling action. In aggregate, that cohort of stocks is currently on track to eliminate over $800 billion from their collective market caps.

In afternoon trade, Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)) and Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA)) each fell 7%, followed by a 6% drop in both Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL)) and Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)). Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)) dipped 3%, while Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)) was off just under 2%.

Outside of the Mag Seven, chip stocks faced similar declines, despite the exemption of semiconductors from Trump's additional tariffs. Nvidia competitor Broadcom ([AVGO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AVGO)), for example, erased well over $50 billion from its market cap following an 8% drop in shares.

""The implications \[of the announced tariffs\] are broad-reaching, and we see negative implications for the whole \[chip\] sector,"" KeyBanc analyst John Vinh wrote in a note to clients. ""These are most notably going to negatively impact end-demand in key markets including smartphones/iPhones and PCs, as a significant amount of manufacturing is done within China.""

Stacy Rasgon, Bernstein's managing director and senior analyst, added in an interview with Yahoo Finance that the biggest headwind for semiconductors is not necessarily the direct impact of tariffs. Rather, it's the risk of demand destruction as these products become more expensive.

He added, ""The other risk for semis is that they are very cyclical, very global, and very correlated to the macro and to GDP. [So if this tips us into recession, ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-economy-dangerously-vulnerable-to-recession-wall-street-reacts-to-tariff-fallout-155837444.html)that's probably not going to be great.""",216,62,1743704032.0,2025-04-03T18:13:52+00:00,t3_1jqpre5,stocks
342,NVDA,Did you buy the dips and then the dips and more dips?,"I have been investing for over 25 years. I invested before and after the dotcom boom. I held on during the great financial crisis and bought some during the Covid-19 pandemics. Most of those major events caught me off guard because they happened so suddenly. But this time, I told myself, not this time. So, I sold half of my holdings in February and put them all in money market. Now, before you say I am a bear, I have not bought any bonds or money market my whole life. I have always been 100% stocks in investing. And before you tell me it is a long game, sure, I understand that. But why not sell now (or earlier) and then buy in when the market inevitably turns lower, and you can re-enter at a much better price. I mean, they practically told you what they are going to do! Why be surprised by it? I am shocked that the market said the tariffs are higher than expected. Expected what? The current market is already priced to perfection. Any bad news will surely jolt the market. Isn't it part of investing is to assess the risks vs rewards?

(A) For those of you that bought the dips, and more dips, I am curious - 

1. What stock did you buy? When? 

2. Why do you think you are buying at the bottom?

(B) If you did not buy the dips -

1. What stocks? When you plan to buy? 

2. What is your entry price?

So, answer would be something similar as (for me) -

(B) 1 - PLTR, NVDA, when I find out the retaliatory tariffs, and the coming unemployment and inflation data in June (the expected Fed Rate Cut).  2 - possibly $80, $90.

Nvidia Stock Is Falling. Not Even Chip Exemption Saves It From Broad Slump.

2:28 PM-Apr 3

NVDA

By Adam Clark

Nvidia looks set to fall sharply following President Donald Trump's imposition of sweeping tariffs on imports to the U.S. The chip maker escaped specific levies but the wider market reaction and fears of Chinese retaliation are set to drag on the shares.

Nvidia shares were down 3.2% at $106.93 in the Thursday premarket having tumbled 5.7% at $104.15 in after-hours trading. The stock rose 0.3% during Wednesday's session.

The tariff announcement wasn't quite as bad as it could have been for Nvidia. Trump said the levy on imports for Taiwan - where Nvidia's chips are mostly manufactured - will be set at 32%. However, the White House published a fact sheet after Trump's announcement that said semiconductors would not be subject to that reciprocal tariff.

That doesn't mean chip tariffs are off the table entirely. Products such as semiconductors, pharmaceuticals and lumber will be addressed separately, a senior administration official said.

The other major concern is likely to be potential retaliation from Beijing, with Chinese goods now facing total duties of 54% after the latest tariff announcements.

Among other chip makers, Advanced Micro Devices fell 5.8% in after-hours trading and Broadcom was down 6.3%.

Meanwhile, Nvidia on Wednesday said its Blackwell computing platform set performance records in tests for inferencing - the process of generating output from Al models - carried out by MLCommons, an open engineering consortium.

There has been speculation over whether Nvidia's dominant position in Al chips would weaken as the focus shifts from training Al models to inference. The company has pushed back hard against that, noting inference makes up around 40% of its data-center revenue and is growing fast. It says that its NVL72 server system delivers a fourfold improvement in Al model training but up to a 30 times improvement in inference compared with previous systems.

Nvidia Stock Is Falling. Not Even Chip Exemption Saves It From Broad Slump.

2:28 PM-Apr 3

NVDA

By Adam Clark

Nvidia looks set to fall sharply following President Donald Trump's imposition of sweeping tariffs on imports to the U.S. The chip maker escaped specific levies but the wider market reaction and fears of Chinese retaliation are set to drag on the shares.

Nvidia shares were down 3.2% at $106.93 in the Thursday premarket having tumbled 5.7% at $104.15 in after-hours trading. The stock rose 0.3% during Wednesday's session.

The tariff announcement wasn't quite as bad as it could have been for Nvidia. Trump said the levy on imports for Taiwan - where Nvidia's chips are mostly manufactured - will be set at 32%. However, the White House published a fact sheet after Trump's announcement that said semiconductors would not be subject to that reciprocal tariff.

That doesn't mean chip tariffs are off the table entirely. Products such as semiconductors, pharmaceuticals and lumber will be addressed separately, a senior administration official said.

The other major concern is likely to be potential retaliation from Beijing, with Chinese goods now facing total duties of 54% after the latest tariff announcements.

Among other chip makers, Advanced Micro Devices fell 5.8% in after-hours trading and Broadcom was down 6.3%.

Meanwhile, Nvidia on Wednesday said its Blackwell computing platform set performance records in tests for inferencing - the process of generating output from Al models - carried out by MLCommons, an open engineering consortium.

There has been speculation over whether Nvidia's dominant position in Al chips would weaken as the focus shifts from training Al models to inference. The company has pushed back hard against that, noting inference makes up around 40% of its data-center revenue and is growing fast. It says that its NVL72 server system delivers a fourfold improvement in Al model training but up to a 30 times improvement in inference compared with previous systems.

247,NVDA,Trump’s Tariff Tsunami: Global Markets in Freefall as Trade War Fears Resurface,"https://preview.redd.it/pifeh2qj6lse1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b2541e11df2fb781d456633587872433690f62f

Well, here we go again. Trump just dropped a massive tariff plan, and the market is in full panic mode. A 10% baseline tariff across the board, plus brutal rates on China (54% effective!), the EU (20%), Vietnam (46%), and Taiwan (32%). The result? Dow futures tanked nearly 1,000 points, the S&amp;P 500 is down big, and tech stocks are getting destroyed. Apple and Tesla? Down 7%. Nvidia? -5%. Even retailers like Dollar Tree and Gap are getting hammered.

If this feels like a rerun of 2018-2019, that’s because it basically is—but worse. Back then, the trade war rattled markets, hurt supply chains, and slowed global growth. Now? We’re already dealing with sticky inflation and a shaky economy. Traders were hoping for some stability, but instead, they got another wildcard move. (trolling a bit, The market will bounce back sooner or later!)

The real gut punch is China’s 54% tariff rate. That’s not a slap on the wrist—it’s a full-blown economic war. European stocks are taking a hit too, especially companies like Adidas (-8.6%) and Volvo Cars (-9%). The global reaction is clear: this isn’t business as usual; this is escalation.

Now the big question: what’s next? If China and the EU retaliate, things could get uglier fast. The market hates uncertainty, and this is serving it up on a silver platter.

Are we looking at another 2019-style rollercoaster, or is this just an overreaction? Buckle up—things are about to get wild. What’s your take?

343,NVDA,Exited most of my positions,"The day before the recent selloff started, I was *this* close to liquidating most of my positions. I had sell orders ready — even hovered over the button on my main holding — but decided to “wait a bit more.” Classic.

For the weeks, I’ve watched my portfolio slowly bleed. Selling options helped cushion the drawdown a bit, and the recent bounce gave me a chance to recover some ground. But personally, **this recent rally feels like a bull trap for the books**. SPY got absolutely no business going 547 - 567.   
In a hope of tarrifs aint gonna be so bad? Well, but the rumors, sell the news. 

I don’t see the market hitting new all-time highs anytime soon. Between tariff tensions, retaliations, and the looming jobs data on Friday, the setup feels fragile. If we get a negative surprise, things could get *very* tight at the exits.

Seasonally, late April through mid-May tends to be choppy with weak returns. That lines up with my short-term view: more bleeding and indecision into the summer, followed by a stronger second half.

I’m still partially exposed — holding quality stocks and layering ITM covered calls. If the market runs, I give up some upside. But if it drops again, the CCs help absorb some of the pain.

My focus is on **high-quality names** like $NVDA, $AAPL, $AMZN, $WMT, $CRWD, and $V. Once the market truly turns, these should lead. NVDA in particular — look at its PE. It’s valued like a value stock, but this is a trillion-dollar company growing triple digits.

They also had the largest funding round in history, $40 Billion raised. Where is the **$40 BILLION** going to go? my guess is NVDA, maybe AVGO for custom chips.

223,NVDA,The trading strategy that would've survived the Trump tariffs,"Today, my mind was blown and my day was ruined. When I saw these results, I had to cancel my plans.

My goal today was to see if Claude understood the principles of “mean reversion”. Being the most powerful language model of 2025, I wanted to see if it could correctly combine indicators together and build a somewhat cohesive mean reverting strategy.

I ended up creating a strategy that DESTROYED the market. Here’s how.

# Configuring Claude 3.7 Sonnet to create trading strategies

To use the Claude 3.7 Sonnet model, I first had to configure it in the NexusTrade platform.

1. [Go to the NexusTrade chat](https://nexustrade.io/chat)
2. Click the “Settings” button
3. Change the model to **Maximum Capability (Claude 3.7 Sonnet)**

[Pic: Using the maximum capability model](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*kBRkiyW2tuVgS1sioNO1EA.png)

After switching to Claude, I started asking about different types of trading strategies.

# Testing Claude’s knowledge of trading indicators

[Pic: Testing Claude’s knowledge of trading indicators](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*3HRhv8zaqPkHd8cUlJZZig.png)

I first started by asking Claude some basic questions about trading strategies.

&gt;What is the difference between mean reversion, break out, and momentum strategies?

Claude gave a great answer that explained the difference very well. I was shocked at the thoroughness.

[Pic: Claude describing the difference between these types of strategies](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*WX334zFKIfNKXA8kCtFrAw.png)

I decided to keep going and tried to see what it knew about different technical indicators. These are calculations that help us better understand market dynamics.

&gt;

* A simple moving average is above a price
* A simple moving average is below a price
* A stock is below a lower bollinger band
* A stock is above a lower bollinger band
* Relative strength index is below a value (30)
* Relative strength index is above a value (30)
* A stock’s rate of change increases (and is positive)
* A stock’s rate of change decreases (and is negative)

&gt;These are all different market conditions. Which ones are breakout, which are momentum, and which are mean reverting?

[Pic: Asking Claude the difference between these indicators](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*S0KFuiG1GrBYQqD94OVmQw.png)

Again, Claude’s answer was very thorough. It even included explanations for how the signals can be context dependent.

[Pic: Claude describing the difference between these indicators](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*B29KsZfLhufFmEBTty77kw.png)

Again, I was very impressed by the thoughtfulness of the LLM. So, I decided to do a fun test.

# Asking Claude to create a market-beating mean-reversion trading strategy

Knowing that Claude has a strong understanding of technical indicators and mean reversion principles, I wanted to see how well it created a mean reverting trading strategy.

Here’s how I approached it.

# Designing the experiment

**Deciding which stocks to pick**

To pick stocks, I applied my domain expertise and knowledge about the relationship between future stock returns and current market cap.

[Pic: Me describing my experiment about a trading strategy that “marginally” outperforms the market](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*wiFwnwFD8M9nHPSMMZY3OQ.png)

From my previous experiments, I found that stocks with a higher market cap tended to match or outperform the broader market… but only marginally.

Thus, I wanted to use this as my initial population.

**Picking a point in time for the experiment start date and end date**

In addition, I wanted to design the experiment in a way that ensured that I was blind to future data. For example, if I picked the biggest stocks now, the top 3 would include NVIDIA, which saw massive gains within the past few years.

It would bias the results.

Thus, I decided to pick 12/31/2021 as the date where I would fetch the stocks.

Additionally, when we create a trading strategy, it automatically runs an initial backtest. To make sure the backtest doesn’t spoil any surprises, we’ll configure it to start on 12/31/2021 and end approximately a year from today.

[Pic: Changing the backtest settings to be 12/31/2021 and end on 03/24/2024](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*wiFwnwFD8M9nHPSMMZY3OQ.png)

**The final query for our stocks**

Thus, to get our initial population of stocks, I created the following query.

&gt;What are the top 25 stocks by market cap as of the end of 2021?

[Pic: Getting the final list of stocks from the AI](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*dw-m83eyF0YHQZTU8q6NrA.png)

After selecting these stocks, I created my portfolio.

**Witnessing Claude create this strategy right in front of me**

Next it’s time to create our portfolio. To do so, I typed the following into the chat.

&gt;Using everything from this conversation, create a mean reverting strategy for all of these stocks. Have a filter that the stock is below is average price is looking like it will mean revert. You create the rest of the rules but it must be a rebalancing strategy

My hypothesis was that if we described the principles of a mean reverting strategy, that Claude would be able to better create at least a sensible strategy.

My suspicions were confirmed.

[Pic: The initial strategy created by Claude](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*GqQa45eRZvJDQQYzeXXO4g.png)

This backtest actually shocked me to my core. **Claude made predictions that came to fruition.**

[Pic: The description that Claude generated at the beginning](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*tvDlSJzAiYjQYzDtIt27nQ.png)

Specifically, at the very beginning of the conversation, Claude talked about the situations where mean reverting strategies performed best.

&gt;“Work best in range-bound, sideways markets” – Claude 3.7

This period was a range-bound sideways markets for most of it. The strategy only started to underperform during the rally afterwards.

Let’s look closer to find out why.

**Examining the trading rules generated by Claude**

If we click the portfolio card, we can get more details about our strategy.

[Pic: The backtest results, which includes a graph of a green line (our strategy) versus a gray line (the broader market), our list of positions, and the portfolio’s evaluation including the percent change, sharpe ratio, sortino ratio, and drawdown.](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*OtYoj_ZbG1wPIcZN7H97Yw.png)

From this view, we can see that the trader would’ve gained slightly more money just holding SPY during this period.

We can also see the exact trading rules.

[Pic: The “Rebalance action” shows the filter that’s being applied to the initial list of stocks](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*G8269ZmluyGA00qIiMFfwQ.png)

We see that for a mean reversion strategy, Claude chose the following filter:

&gt;(Price &lt; 50 Day SMA) and (14 Day RSI &gt; 30) and (14 Day RSI &lt; 50) and (Price &gt; 20 Day Bollinger Band)

If we just think about what this strategy means. From the initial list of the top 25 stocks by market cap as of 12/31/2021,

* Filter this to only include stocks that are below their 50 day average price AND
* Their 14 day relative strength index is greater than 30 (otherwise, not oversold) AND
* Their 14 day RSI is less than 50 (meaning not overbought) AND
* Price is above the 20 day Bollinger Band (meaning the price is starting to move up even though its below its 50 day average price)

[Pic: A graph of what this would look like on the stock’s chart](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*3x5639sO_5qJj5tBZDGXhg.png)

It’s interesting that this strategy over-performed during the bearish and flat periods, but underperformed during the bull rally. Let’s see how this strategy would’ve performed in the past year.

**Out of sample testing**

[Pic: The results of the Claude-generated trading strategy](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*9CXKYDuA5M1ivBPHxCzQwA.png)

Throughout the past year, the market has experienced significant volatility.

Thanks to the election and Trump’s undying desire to crash the stock market with tariffs, the S&amp;P500 is up only 7% in the past year (down from 17% at its peak).

[Pic: The backtest results for this trading strategy](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*4V4ar4f9JoYqa_q5PhDAEQ.png)

If the strategy does well in more sideways market, does that mean the strategy did well in the past year?

Spoiler alert: yes.

[Pic: Using the AI chat to backtest this trading strategy](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*2I84QYoAfYfMI4nTv10K2A.png)

Using NexusTrade, I launched a backtest.

&gt;backtest this for the past year and year to date

After 3 minutes, when the graph finished loading, I was shocked at the results.

[Pic: A backtest of this strategy for the past year](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*KViWftb4k7BuhGpy6ivTuQ.png)

This strategy didn’t just beat the market. It absolutely destroyed it.

Let’s zoom in on it.

[Pic: The detailed backtest results of this trading strategy](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*eJ51xJSleE-CNBcC4rnmpw.png)

From 03/03/2024 to 03/03/2025:

* The portfolio’s value increased by over $4,000 or 40%. Meanwhile, SPY gained 15.5%.
* The sharpe ratio, a measure of returns weighted by the “riskiness” of the portfolio was 1.25 (versus SPY’s 0.79).
* The sortino ratio, another measure of risk-adjusted returns, was 1.31 (versus SPY’s 0.88).

Then, I quickly noticed something.

The AI made a mistake.

# Catching and fixing the mistake

The backtest that the AI generated was from 03/03/2024 to 03/03/2025.

But today is April 1st, 2025. This is not what I asked for of “the past year”, and in theory, if we were attempting to optimize the strategy over the initial time range, we could’ve easily and inadvertently introduced lookahead bias.

While not a huge concern for this article, we should always be safe rather than sorry. Thus, I re-ran the backtest and fixed the period to be between 03/03/2024 and 04/01/2025.

[Pic: The backtest for this strategy](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*o9odq5SV1mS_ADlz55nkcw.png)

Thankfully, the *actual* backtest that we wanted showed a similar picture as the first one.

**This strategy outperformed the broader market by over 300%.**

Similar to the above test, this strategy has a higher sharpe ratio, higher sortino ratio, and greater returns.

# Future thought-provoking questions for future experimentation

This was an extremely fun conversation I had with Claude! Knowing that this strategy does well in sideways markets, I started to think of some possible follow-up questions for future research.

1. What if we did this but excluded the big name tech stocks like Apple, Amazon, Google, Netflix, and Nvidia?
2. Can we detect programmatically when a sideways market is ending and a breakout market is occurring?
3. If we fetched the top 25 stocks by market cap as of the end of 2018, how would our results have differed?
4. What if we only included stocks that were profitable?

If you’re someone that’s learning algorithmic trading, I encourage you to explore one of these questions and write an article on your results.

# Concluding thoughts

In this article, we witnessed something truly extraordinary.

AI was capable of beating the market.

The AI successfully identified key technical indicators — combining price relative to the 50-day SMA, RSI between 30 and 50, and price position relative to the Bollinger Band — to generate consistent returns during volatile market conditions. This strategy proved especially effective during sideways markets, including the recent period affected by election uncertainty and tariff concerns.

What’s particularly remarkable is the strategy’s 40% return compared to SPY’s 15.5% over the same period, along with superior risk-adjusted metrics like sharpe and sortino ratios. This demonstrates the potential for AI language models to develop sophisticated trading strategies when guided by someone with domain knowledge and proper experimental design. The careful selection of stocks based on historical market cap rather than current leaders also eliminated hindsight bias from the experiment.

These results open exciting possibilities for trading strategy development using AI assistants as collaborative partners. By combining human financial expertise with Claude’s ability to understand complex indicator relationships, traders can develop customized strategies tailored to specific market conditions. The approach demonstrated here provides a framework that others can apply to different stock populations, timeframes, or market sectors.

225,NVDA,Bought NVDA at the wrong time? Not sure what to do next,"Hi everyone,

I know absolutely nothing about investing. My understanding is just: I buy stocks, they can go up or down, and I either make or lose money.

On January 6th, I bought 73 shares of NVIDIA. I had heard from friends that they made good money with it, so I thought I’d try it too.

I’m from Brazil, and I paid BRL 1,381.61. Now my investment is worth BRL 951.92 — that’s a loss of BRL 429.24.

Looking at the chart on Google, it seems like I got unlucky and bought right before it dropped.

My question is: should I just accept the loss and take my money out before it drops more? Or should I leave it there and hope for the best?

I honestly have no clue what might happen next, and to be honest, I’m not really interested in learning more about investing — I just want to make a reasonable decision here.

Thanks in advance!

EDIT: Based on the comments, I think it's important to clarify that I didn't have any specific goal with this investment — I just wanted to grow my money over the long term. I was aware of the risk of losing money, so I only invested an amount I was comfortable with potentially losing. From what I've read in the comments, it seems like holding onto these shares for the long term might actually be a good idea (Apparently even buying more haha).",0,98,1743546395.0,2025-04-01T22:26:35+00:00,t3_1jp8s83,stocks

And honestly, most of them haven’t even really made it. They flash $5K profits like it’s life-changing, act like they’ve cracked some elite code, and immediately try to monetize by selling that knowledge—if you can even call it that. The truth is, a lot of them haven’t experienced the ups and downs, the late nights, the risk management, or the psychological grind that comes with serious trading. It’s like they haven’t actually earned it yet, but still want to skip to the payout by selling to others who don’t know any better.

It feels like they’re not teaching from experience—they’re teaching to make money instead of trading to make money. That’s a major difference. There’s a level of authenticity and credibility that should come before you sell a course. If you’re not consistently profitable, if you haven’t been through losses, strategies, market cycles, and real success, how are you supposed to lead others? It’s not just about having flashy charts or a highlight reel of a few wins. It’s about building long-term value and actually helping people get better—not just cashing in on the hype.",0,7,1743488309.0,2025-04-01T06:18:29+00:00,t3_1joowlj,StockMarket

345,NVDA,"Month Recap: The S&amp;P 500 had extended losing streak to 2-months. Will it continue in April? Feb. 28, 2025 - Mar. 31, 2025","First of all, I don’t want to be misunderstood. This heat map is monthly that it reflects closing prices from Feb. 28 to Mar. 31. 

The most important topic in this month is tariffs which will continue to discuss in the next month. Additionally, concerns about AI, recession fears, and mixed economic datas on the negative side. Occasionally, we had made jumps like government shutdown. In summary, the market faced multiple negative factors and dropped more than 5% in a single month. Today started with selling pressure and hit the 5,488.73. If the index does not recover, we may be looking at more negative month. 

As I mentioned in the title, The S&amp;P 500 extended its losing streak to 2-months. Let's look at the numbers:

Sep. 30 close at 5,762.48 - Oct. 31 close at 5,705.45 🔴 (-0.99%)

Oct. 31 close at 5,705.45 - Nov. 29 close at 6,032.38 🟢 (+4.68%)

Nov. 29 close at 6,032.38 - Dec. 31 close at 5,881.63 🔴 (-2.50%)

Dec. 31 close at 5,881.63 - Jan. 31 close at 6,040.53 🟢 (+2.70%)

Jan. 31 close at 6,040.53 - Feb. 28 close at 5,954.50 🔴 (-1.44%)

Feb. 28 close at 5,954.50 - Mar. 21 close at 5,611.90 🔴 (-5.75%)

The stock market story is fully negative for now. However, gold and silver have jumped over 9% this month. The stock market had been shining in 2024. It had made a strong rally.

Dec. 29. 2023 close at 4,769.83 - Dec. 31. 2024 close at 5,881.63 🟢 (+23.3%)

January started strong, but that momentum has turned. The market needs a new factor for an uptrend, such as decreasing inflation, rate cut, or something. How was your month? Did you catch any winners like Berkshire or stocks in the Health Care sector? What are your thoughts on the next month?

My summary ends here, but many people have asked about the tools I use. I shared them in a previous post, but I want to add them here again. If you're not interested, feel free to skip this part. :)

We're pretty close to near lows from 3/13 (18 days ago, lol). 

Overall will be trying to buy a bounce for a day trade if we do end up breaking, but probably will be more focused on a VXX short rather than buying the market overall. I'm interested if we selloff or pop on the open, if we break new lows I may short/then flip long. This kind of headline-driven macro environment is a pain in the ass to keep track of, but creates a lot more opportunity for short-term trading. Risks that can change the tariff narrative or move the market include unexpected retaliation from trade partners, weakening consumer/investor confidence (like last week's numbers), and spillover into energy and commodity prices (Trump has signaled some action on oil, but we aren't sure what yet).

Delivery numbers are expected Wednesday and typically report premarket, so good to be cognizant of that. I'm interested in seeing if we can hold below $250 today. The EV sector in general has entered a consolidation phase, with cost competition and flagging consumer incentives weighing on demand, and BYD is hot on TSLA's heels and likely going to overtake TSLA within the year. Below-consensus deliveries could spark a guidance reset for earnings, margin compression of their other cars due to the Model Q, and market share loss in China and Europe are key concerns. Also random people torching Tesla dealerships.

Mar. 24, 2025 - Mar. 28, 2025","First of all, I don’t want to be misunderstood. This heat map is weekly that it reflects closing prices from Mar. 21 to Mar. 28. This week,

🔸 Tesla gained 5.93%. The auto tariffs had no impact due to the U.S based production.

🔸 Ford fell 2.7% and General Motors dropped 6.27% about concerns over supply chains.

🔸 Berkshire closed slightly positive in the negative conditions. The investors believe Buffett.

🔸 Semiconductors had significant loses on Wednesday. It's selling pressure on the Nasdaq and the stock market.

🔴 Nasdaq: 17,322.99 (-2.59%)

🔴 DJI: 41,583.90 (-0.95%)

Day-by-Day Standouts;

🔸 Monday: The rising continued from the previous week. The indexes broke a 4-week losing streak. The S&amp;P 500 gained over 1.5% and it reached highest rising level for the week. 🟢

🔸 Tuesday: A quiet day. The market awaited key data releases on Wednesday and Friday. Consumer Confidence released at 92.9 and its lowest level since February 2021, but it had not impact. The indexes closed slightly positive and extended winning streak to 3-days. 🟢

🔸 Wednesday: Trump announced new tariff plans for automotive imports. It triggered heavy selling pressure. The indexes lost around 1.5%. 🔴

🔸 Thursday: The day started with GDP report which decreased from 3.1% to 2.4% (better than the expected 2.3%). There was nothing extra thing and the indexes closed slightly lowered. 🔴

🔸 Friday: The most important data of the week was PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditure). Core PCE was expected at 2.7% YoY, but it exceeded expectations at 2.8%. The PCE is came matched with the expectations. It's 3% MoM and 2.5% YoY. I think, the more important data was 1-year Inflation Expectations. It came 5% and highest value since November 2022. As a result, the indexes lost more than 2%. It was rough day. 🔴

Meanwhile, gold gained over 2% and silver surged more than 3%. Do you invest in them? I bought gold around 2300 and still hold it.

* Claude 3.7 Sonnet outperformed everything else by a significant margin
* Google Gemini Pro 2.5 offers remarkable quality for a free model
* DeepSeek V3 performed exceptionally well despite not being a reasoning model
* Grok underperformed in this area (though it excels in reasoning-heavy backend tasks)

I wanted to share these findings for a couple key reasons:

First, it's abundantly clear that AI development hasn't plateaued - we're seeing models that are both more capable AND more affordable than last year's offerings. While Claude 3.7 Sonnet (the top performer) maintains last year's pricing, it delivers substantially better results. Many other strong contenders are now available at low cost or even free.

Second, this sends an important signal to software developers globally, especially those working overseas. While truly exceptional developers (the ""10x"" engineers) aren't at risk, AI is increasingly capable of replacing entry-level developers who might previously have been hired for more basic tasks.

Marriott PEG over 1.60. High forward PE.

229,NVDA,"CoreWeave, the biggest IPO of 2025. (DD on $CRWV)","# I love IPOs.

The last IPO I thought was amazing was ARM (and how far we've come!).  Coreweave (IPOing on the 28th!) is another one I think has a ton of potential. (I wrote the majority of this before the reduced IPO sizing so please forgive me if my math is incorrect).

CoreWeave is a cloud infrastructure provider specializing in GPU computing, called an “AI hyperscaler.” They run data centers full of GPUs and rent out that computing power to customers via the cloud. Similar to AWS/Azure, but they're focused on AI/ML/GPU tasks like making stupid Studio Ghibli pictures of yourself.

CRWV started in 2017 mining ETH but pivoted to being a GPU farm in 2019 after the crash. By 2022, they fully exited crypto mining and doubled down on enterprise GPU cloud services​. This early mover advantage in GPU hosting, (along with all the GPUs they bought from NVDA), have made it a player in the the cloud services space.

CRWV makes money by charging for usage-based cloud compute - clients pay for GPU hours on their servers.​ Initially, they served niches like VFX studios (movies like Interstellar take millions of GPU hours to render), but now AI training and inference workloads are the main growth driver​.

Companies like META/IBM/MSFT have used CRWV for AI compute needs in the past​. CRWV's differentiator is through software- they claim custom scheduling software (e.g. a system called “SUNK” and an optimizer “Tensorizer”) that yields better hardware utilization, faster container spin-ups, and higher throughput than general-purpose which makes them more efficient to use.

In practice, that means a customer training a large ML model might get results faster or cheaper on CRWV than on AWS. CRWV currently operates 32 data centers with 250k+ NVDA GPUs and are very aggressive in acquiring them- they deploy A100, H100, and H200s and are prioritized as customers of NVDA.

**The NVDA Relationship**

NVDA backs CRWV, and they're strong partners (which means they prioritize each other over other customers). Due to this, I dismiss the possibility that CRWV will ever have troubles on the supply side of obtaining GPUs. Something that is fairly common knowledge is that NVDA (and other companies) prefer selling GPUs in bulk because it simplifies customer service and they can charge for enterprise support and  sell thousands at a time. It's also why NVDA spits on the face of their gaming customers.

**Isn't it kind of shady that NVDA both invests and is a customer of CRWV? Why doesn't NVDA use their own chips instead of renting capacity from CRWV?**

Kind of. Nothing they've done is outright illegal (even using their GPUs as collateral is within the law). Even companies that build GPUs need to rent compute when there's a massive amount of demand. MSFT did it, NVDA did it, OpenAI WILL do it. CRWV signed a direct deal with OpenAI: a multi-year commitment up to $11.9 B for GPU cloud capacity​. They have ties to the major AI players. This entire DD going forward assumes that they will continue to keep their relationship with NVDA because NVDA needs them so AWS doesn't swallow the entire market. 

**The Financials**

CRWV has had ridiculous growth- In 2022, they had revenue of $15.8 M (the majority of which came from ETH mining). In 2023, their GPU computing pivot led to revenue of $229M, then $1.9B in 2024. This was obviously fueled by the release of ChatGPT as demand for GPU compute exploded as other companies scrambled to compete with their OWN LLM models.

By 2024, CRWV neared $2 B in annual sales, transforming from a niche player to a major cloud provider in two years.

The financial issue is that CRWV is unprofitable as it scales. In 2023, it lost \~$600M, and in 2024m \~$860M. For every $1 of revenue in 2024, they spent about $1.45 for huge investments in data centers, GPUs, and the associated operating costs (plus interest on debt they've taken out which they have a ton of).

The S-1 shows operating costs close to \~$1B from tech/infra in 2024, which includes data center space, buying/depreciating their GPUs, electricity costs, maintenance staff, etc. The capex is massive and is funded largely by debt.

The cash burn is brutal as well- at the end of 2024 CRWV still has negative FCF (which is normal for a pre-ipo high growth tech startup) and is betting that they will eventually claw their way to profitability despite the brutal looking financials (like Uber, Snowflake, Robinhood, insert your choice of tech startup here lol). The bet is that high upfront investment now will secure long-term contracts and scale to profitability later, like most tech IPOs.

**Customer Concentration**

In 2023, Microsoft accounted for \~35% of CRWV’s revenue​. In 2024, that grew to \~62% of total revenue​. Their S-1 mentioned that close to \~80% of their revenue comes from two customers alone. But this is a warning sign because MSFT wants to build their own (hence their announcement of spending \~$80B in 2025 for AI data centers).

**If MSFT scales back their use of CRWV then they are frankly fucked.** MSFT's CEO also mentioned that using external capacity (like CRWV) for GPUs was a short-term stopgap until their own investment in Azure pays off.

However, the OpenAI deal (remember that OpenAI is 49% owned by MSFT) could take the place of MSFT going forward. The contract is up to $11.9B through 2030​, which averages out to \~$2B/year if used, which is equivalent to all of CRWV's 2024 revenue.  If OpenAI maximizes their usage, CRWV’s revenue could potentially double at minimum if MSFT doesn't pull out. This is a wild hopium optimistic case but I thought it was worth mentioning.

Beyond those two, CRWV has other customers that make up the \~20% of 2024 revenue). These include research labs, VFX studios, and other tech companies but none are individually as large compared to the MSFT/OpenAI. What will make or break this company in the long run is the diversification of the client base because all their eggs are in one basket.

**IPO Technicals**

CRWV sold 37.5M shares at $40/share, getting $1.5B and giving it a $20B valuation. That was below CRWV's official target of offering 49M shares at $47-$55, raising up to $2.7B at $32B valuation​. This signals a lack of interest in the initial offering and is not great news if you already hold the stock, but is excellent if you're a short term trader that wants to see a pop on IPO day- the stock has more room to run. Yes, this means it's good for retail, bad for insiders.

**Valuation/Comparables**

Is a \~$20B valuation reasonable for CRWV? You can do a rough comparison:

|**Company**|Annual Revenue (2024)|**Recent Valuation**|**EV/Revenue Multiple**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**CoreWeave** (CRWV)|$1.92 B|\~$20B (target IPO)|\~10×|
|**Snowflake** (SNOW)|$3.41 B​|\~$52 B (market cap)|\~15× ​|
|**Databricks**\*|\~$3 B by end of 2025|\~$62 B ​|\~20×|
|**AWS** (AMZN)|$107.6 B​|\~$500 B|\~4-5×|

(That's not a typo- AWS is valued at \~$500B, it's the main driver of AMZN's growth, yet struggles to grow because it's already massive). \*Also note that Databricks is a private company

I think that if the company can maintain a hyper-growth trajectory (e.g. 2-3× growth for a couple more years), then an 10× multiple now could look cheap in hindsight. For instance, 2025 revenue could hit \~$4 B+ with the OpenAI ramp and other clients. Of course, we have risks like growth decelerating, and tariffs and Trump and China that could come in and decimate growth. And of course, they're not profitable (for now). Ironically, CRWV and other US firms would BENEFIT from chip restrictions because they'd be prioritized over the overseas ones that use NVDA chips.

CRWV’s valuation is aggressive (dare I say fair for a hyperscaler), but in line  with other cloud providers. The entire short term bull thesis depends on them retaining MSFT as a customer and also keeping OpenAI- if that occurs then investing in it now looks like a no-brainer. If not, **it's completely possible we see an 50%+ selloff. I think that's the reason why we're seeing such hesitancy in this valuation.**

This valuation is also dependent on entirely dependent on AI spending GROWING, society seeing greater integration in AI (more than we have now), and AI firms willing to continue spending on compute they can't harness themselves. We are still supply constrained on GPUs in general, and if we ever experience NVDA building more GPUs than there is demand for, then Coreweave's margins are threatened and profitability can vanish. For now, it looks like that is unlikely to happen.

**IPO Trading Details**

37.5M shares is decent IPO volume so I don't expect this to be illiquid when it trades. The main things I watch for are indication price (whether there are people who want to buy the print of the stock higher than what we IPO at) and share paired (which somewhat signal when the IPO will open for trading).

Overall, this is a pure AI play on GPU compute, a bet that demand for GPUs will continue to outstrip supply,  and that MSFT/OpenAI/every other tech firm involved won't slit their throat in in the eternal game of thrones that is capitalism.

**TL;DR:** There's a hell of a lot of risk, but I like the stock. It's completely possible it could open and sell off because the insiders just want to bail. It's possible that it skyrockets. Anything is possible in the wild and crazy world of IPO trading.

i bought dell @ 120 and had to sell @ 110 (got lucky before it crashed further) its below 100.

SMCI was the biggest one (took a toll on my emotional health for many months) bought at $620 pre split and was lucky enough to average down and break even @ $35.

the only stock that made me money was AMZN i sold @ 235 which i had bought for 164 last August.

  
However, i made the biggest investing mistake of my life putting my life savings into NVDA @ 124$ a share (i took huge risk because i came from nothing and i wanted to become someone, thinking this stock was actually good).

231,NVDA,Stocks Close Higher for 3rd Straight Day; Tesla Surges in Late Trading to Extend Rally,"
Major indexes closed slightly higher Tuesday as the stock market continued its recovery from an extended selloff.

The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite added 0.2% and 0.5%, respectively, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose fractionally. Stocks had kicked off the week with big gains following news that President Trump could scale back some of the tariffs that are due to be imposed next week on U.S. trading partners. With the recent gains, the Dow has inched back into positive territory for 2025, as stocks have rebounded from a month-long selloff spurred by concerns about the potential impact of tariffs and uncertainty about the outlook for the economy.

Investors brushed off consumer confidence data released this morning that came in weaker than expected, with the index hitting its lowest level in more than four years. Investors are closing watching all data points amid worries that tariffs could reignite inflation and cause economic growth to stall. The big economic report of the week comes Friday with the scheduled release of the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which had fallen during the recent stock market rout amid the growing concerns about the economy, was at 4.32% in late trading, down from 4.33% at yesterday's close and from an earlier high Tuesday of 4.37%. The yield, which affects costs on all sorts of loans, notably mortgages, hit its highest level in more than a month this morning.

Mega-cap technology stocks, which helped lead Monday's rally, were mostly higher again today. Shares of Tesla (TSLA) rallied late in the day to finish 3.5% higher, gaining ground for the 5th consecutive session, despite news Tuesday that the EV maker's sales in Europe continued to slide. Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN) and Meta Platforms (META) each rose more than 1%, while Microsoft (MSFT) inched ahead. Chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO) closed slightly lower

353,NVDA,Thoughts on TSLA's and NVDA's moves yesterday.,"TSLA surged 11.93% yesterday to close at 278.39, then pushed strongly in after-hours trading to 282.35. From the pre-market session, stocks all opened higher with very strong buying pressure—especially during the first hour, when momentum flowed upward almost without resistance. Looking back, TSLA is truly a stock driven by sentiment, with both bulls and bears capable of causing dramatic swings. Once sentiment is in play, the price moves can be enormous. In my view, it’s likely to continue performing strongly today rather than simply pull back.



NVDA closed up 3.15% at 121.41 yesterday. Although it experienced some volatility in the hour before the market opened, it gradually moved higher with the overall market and reached a high of 122.22. However, NVDA’s upward momentum doesn’t seem particularly strong right now, and there’s significant resistance between 123 and 124, which might make a quick breakout challenging.



Additionally, META, GOOGL, and AAPL are all showing signs of bottoming out and bouncing, which could present good opportunities for a bullish swing trade. Next Wednesday marks tariff day, and in my opinion, the market may be keen to stage a big rally before then—with a secondary directional move likely unfolding on tariff day itself.

S&amp;P 500 contacts also gained about 1% in early Monday trading. Tesla Inc. added about 4% in premarket trading. Nvidia Corp. and Palantir Technologies Inc. rose amid news that Jack Ma’s Ant Group Co. has developed AI techniques that could cut costs by 20%.

Meanwhile, the dollar weakened and Treasury yields ticked higher. European indexes were broadly little changed. German software developer SAP SE took the spot as Europe’s most-valuable public company, unseating Danish weight-loss drug maker Novo Nordisk A/S, whose shares have declined 18% this year.

Investors were taking some comfort from indications that President Donald Trump’s coming wave of tariffs is poised to be more targeted than the barrage he has occasionally threatened. The administration is not planning separate, sectoral-specific tariffs to be unveiled at the same event on April 2, officials said.

“This raises the possibility that some sectors and countries may fare better than others, helping explain market optimism,” said Daniel Murray, chief executive officer of EFG Asset Management in Zurich.

Day-by-Day Standouts;
Monday: The previous Friday, the government shutdown reduced fears. And then, the stock market was jumped 2%. In the weekend, Scott Bessent said ""I’ve been in the investment business for 35 years, and I can tell you that corrections are healthy. They’re normal."". As a result, the futures market opened negative, but the day closed in positive territory. 🟢

Tuesday: After 2-day winning streak, the stock market opened lower. Concerns over Powell’s upcoming remarks on Wednesday led to larger than expected losses. 🔴

Wednesday: The Fed kept rates steady as expected and signaled continued monitoring of key economic data. The stock market reacted positively. 🟢

Tuesday: A quiet day with slight losses 🔴

Friday: After a calm Thursday, President Trump's remarks on tariffs and the Fed's rate cut. Additionally, the third Friday of each month is Triple Witching Day which typically carries negative expectations. Despite early losses, the stock market recovered and closed slightly positive. 🟢

The S&amp;P 500 hit 6,147 on February 19, 2025, and then hit the lowest level at 5,504.65 on March, 13. This week, it closed 5,638.94. On Monday, Wednesday, and Tuesday the index tested the 200-day EMA, but it remains below. A breakout above this level could signal an uptrend. Meanwhile, 10-year bonds continue their downtrend. I’ve completed my purchases and focused on the long term.

233,NVDA,Honest question from long term investor,"I’ve been a long term investor for decades. I’m in solid stocks including the M7. My question, “Should I pull out of at least my M7 (already cashed out TSLA) from the market to cash and reenter well after April 6th?”  So at this point I’m up on all my long term stocks ranging from 39% to 167% as I’ve been is a long time. So nothing would be at a loss. I just feel we are facing a man made intentional potential crash of US stocks. Could be short term or long term. One issue, I’m also near retirement age so I don’t have 20 years to wait for a correction. 
Let me further say all my eggs are not in one basket. I’m fully diversified with only 1/3 of my liquid assets in stock. Because of my age 2/3 is in very safe such as CD’s near 5%. Also 2 houses paid off, nice car paid off, zero debt on credit cards paid off monthly. 
But I can’t make a misstep. My portfolio will be 1/2 of the income I will rely on for income in a few years. 


I know we are not supposed to make rash decisions based on “feelings” but it’s more than that, I’m reading nonstop everything about this market and as an older person I feel like I’m seeing a potential 2008 all over again. I wisely went cash then. And in 2010 bought my house for only  42% of it was valued in 2006. Now it’s worth 5 times what I paid for it. 

So anyone who has weathered a few markets, what’s your take? Is cashing out Apple,Amazon,NVDA for instance a crazy move right now? ",27,97,1742671029.0,2025-03-22T19:17:09+00:00,t3_1jhg8n8,stocks
358,NVDA,A Nvidia Trade from 2011 that became one of my biggest life lessons.,"https://preview.redd.it/9dwjv7gs79qe1.png?width=1569&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ece4c08736381958e72e2d76ba1e2566fed0bf64

Don’t ever get shaken out of your conviction. In trading and life. Tough lesson here but I had to exit this trade due to life circumstances after holding Nvidia for 3 years in sideways action.  I believe these shares would be the equivalent of about $0.43 after splits.

  
I knew the potential of Nvidia in the 90s/early 2000s when I was in high school. I was building gaming computers with their chips after them taking over 3dfx (Voodoo line). My thought was if the GPU is the most important element for gaming and being able to do rapid fire complicated calculations, what is the end game for Nvidia? Well, we know the rest of the story of where that led. So, in 2011 when I started really learning about the stock market, I bought shares and just held it. I had to sell due to a large purchase and at the time, was money better utilized as the frustration of holding no movement in either direction finally got to me.",383,122,1742654929.0,2025-03-22T14:48:49+00:00,t3_1jha3wo,StockMarket

* META is its own customer for all the AI investment unlike MSFT, AMZN
* Whatsapp is huge in India. Meta can introduce LLAMA based products for Whatsapp for business which will help monetize Whatsapp
* Most people use Insta, Facebook.
* Downsides: Ad spend will be hurt during recession. Too much selling from Mark. Company itself decided not to do buyback atm

HOOD (bullish)

* Around 27 PE (though last quarter included one time boost). Actual PE should be around 35. 
* Clean app first approach compared to Schwab, Fidelity etc
* One stop shop for Stocks, Options, Crypto, Sports betting

AMD (Bearish)

* Stock is stuck in the middle. Hyperscalers either pay for expensive NVDA or cheaper self made chips. AMD seems to be stuck in the middle and the value prop is not convincing. (not as good as NVDA, not as cheap as your home made chips) 
* AMZN said noone wants AMD stuff
* AVGO has secured #2 spot with demand for custom AI chips
* NVDA itself is going down. From 75 PE last year it has dropped to almost 35 PE. With threats from deep seek, MSFT shutting down data centers we can feel AI boom is starting to slow down",0,18,1742593653.0,2025-03-21T21:47:33+00:00,t3_1jgsi2e,stocks
359,NVDA,Caught in a Stock Market Spiral—Should I Keep Dollar-Cost Averaging or Pivot to Bonds? Need Your Thoughts!,"I’m looking for some perspective from the hive mind here. Over the past month, I’ve been religiously dollar-cost averaging (DCA) into the market—every single month, like clockwork. And every single month, my portfolio takes a hit as stocks slide lower. I’m not panicking (yet), but I’m starting to wonder: to what end? Is this a dip worth riding out, or am I throwing good money after bad?

Here’s my current play: I’m heavy into TSLA, TQQQ, NVDA, AMD, QUBT, GOOGL, and AMZN. It’s a tech-heavy lineup, and I’m drawn to the growth potential—especially with AI buzz and Tesla’s wild ride. But with stocks like TQQQ (that 3x leverage is a rollercoaster) and QUBT (quantum computing feels like a sci-fi bet), I’m wondering if I’m too concentrated in high-risk, high-reward names. Lately, I’ve been eyeing bonds and Treasuries as a way to diversify. Yields on the 10-year Treasury are hovering around 4.6% (last I checked), and with the Fed hinting at maybe two more rate cuts in 2025, it’s tempting to lock in some stability. But then I think—am I bailing on growth too soon? The market’s been volatile, and the political landscape isn’t helping—Trump’s tariff talks, inflation worries, and whatever Congress does or doesn't do... How do you all see this playing out?

So, here’s where I’m at:  

1. Should I keep DCA-ing into these companies? TSLA’s got Elon’s chaos factor, NVDA and AMD are riding the AI wave, but QUBT feels like a long shot. TQQQ’s leverage scares me when the Nasdaq’s shaky. GOOGL and AMZN feel safer, but are they enough to balance this?  
2. Is now a smart time to diversify into bonds or Treasuries? Or am I overreacting to a temporary dip?  
3. If I stick with DCA, how long should I ride this out? Should I pause for a few months and see where the market—and politics—lands?  
4. What’s your take on the current market vibe? Are we in for more pain, or is this a buying opportunity disguised as a bloodbath?

**Note: I am working with a FA on my primary accounts, this is a personal account with around 50K invested and 20K left in dry powder.** 

I’m not looking for a crystal ball... Just want to hear how you’re navigating this mess. Anyone else DCA-ing through the storm? Anyone pivoting to fixed income? What’s your endgame? Let’s talk it out—I need some sanity checks and maybe a few wild predictions to keep things spicy.",0,42,1742573657.0,2025-03-21T16:14:17+00:00,t3_1jgkkzv,StockMarket

236,NVDA,Short sellers have made $15 billion betting against Tesla and Nvidia in 2025,"Short sellers have been cleaning up to start 2025 amid a massive sell-off in some of the market's most popular names over the past two years.

Short sellers have made a combined $15 billion betting against Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) stock thus far this year, according to data from S3 Partners. Tesla shorts alone have raked in nearly $11 billion, while bets against Nvidia have brought in more than $4 billion.

Tesla's 40% year-to-date drop has led the declines of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks. Investors have grown concerned about CEO Elon Musk's focus on government efficiency efforts and how his role with President Trump's administration could be a turnoff to the electric vehicle maker's customer base.

But it hasn't just been Tesla lagging. As an index, the Magnificent Seven — which also includes Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) — is underperforming the S&amp;P 500 this quarter by the most since 2022.

Short sellers have profited off of all of the names in the cohort this year. They've brought in nearly $5 billion betting against Apple stock, which is down nearly 14% in 2025.

The crash in the most popular trade of the past two years comes as investors have been re-rating their growth expectations. Fears of slowing economic growth and the impact of Trump's tariff policies have weighed on markets. Meanwhile, Big Tech has faced growing investor criticism about its ballooning AI spend and whether or not it will eventually boost future profits as much as Wall Street hopes. The year also included a massive drawdown in some large tech names, including Nvidia, following the release of a cheaper AI model from Chinese company DeepSeek.

Now, with most of the names sitting around 20% off their recent 52-week highs, the looming question for markets is whether or not investor appetite for the stocks that led the market higher for the past two years will return.

""Maybe these tech stocks got ahead of their skis a little bit,"" BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski told Yahoo Finance last week. ""But at the end of the day, these are monster companies that define the growth trajectory for the United States stock market. They are not going away.""

361,NVDA,"Tariffs, Tweets, and Market Volatility—Did the Market Really Miss This?","So, I've been wondering—if the market is supposed to be so smart, why
didn't it see this coming?
We're often told that ""the market is always right"" and that it's a
forward-thinking beast. But let's look at the numbers since the
election:

Election Day to Inauguration Day: S&amp;P 500 up 4.6%
Inauguration Day to Today: S&amp;P 500 down -6.31%
Election Day to Today: S&amp;P 500 down -2%

And if you're looking at other indices or stocks like NVDA, TSLA, or
NASDAQ, the numbers are even worse.

Here's the kicker: The main reason for the recent volatility? Tariffs.
And let's be honest—tariffs were the centerpiece of Trump's campaign.
He talked about them at every rally, every event, and even after the
election. We knew this was coming. So why did the market wait until
the last minute to react?

You'd think the market would have gone sideways during the
uncertainty, waiting to see how things played out. But instead, it
seemed like investors were overly excited about a Republican taking
office. Which, by the way, doesn't even make sense—history shows the
market doesn't really care who's in the White House.

This is why I'll stick to my DCA strategy. Politics and macroeconomics
are just too unpredictable. No one ever gets it right, and that's
okay.",36,48,1742492176.0,2025-03-20T17:36:16+00:00,t3_1jfujvo,StockMarket

240,NVDA,Trump’s Trade War 2.0: The Stocks I’m Watching,"With Trump back in office and tariffs returning in full force, I’ve been analyzing what this means for U.S. equities. His latest moves—25% steel and aluminum tariffs, expanded levies on Chinese imports, and a tariff-heavy negotiation strategy—echo his first term but with even **stronger measures**.



While 2018-2020 gave us some clues, the market setup in 2025 is **different**:

• **Higher inflation &amp; rates:** Tariffs add inflationary pressure, making the Fed’s job harder.

• **China’s response will change:** Unlike in 2018, China now **dominates EV battery production** and **controls rare earth supply chains**—this could hurt U.S. tech more than before.

• **Supply chain resilience is mixed:** Companies have talked about reshoring for years, but it’s still expensive and slow.

Given these factors, here’s how I’m positioning:

**Likely Winners:**

1. **Steel &amp; Aluminum (NUE, STLD, CLF)** – Tariffs give them pricing power, though cost inflation is a risk.

2. **Defense &amp; Cybersecurity (LMT, PLTR, CRWD)** – “America First” likely means **higher defense budgets**.

3. **Regional Banks (JPM, BAC, GS)** – If deregulation follows, these should gain.

4. **Domestic Infrastructure (CAT, DE, OSK)** – If tariffs hurt foreign suppliers, U.S. construction demand rises.



**Likely Losers:**

1. **Tech Giants (AAPL, NVDA, QCOM, INTC)** – Heavy China exposure = supply chain and revenue risks.

2. **Consumer Goods (NKE, WMT, DG)** – Imports get pricier, and passing costs to lower-income customers is tough.

3. **Auto &amp; Industrial (TSLA, GM, F, MMM)** – Higher input costs + China retaliation = pain.

4. **Agri Exporters (ADM, TSN, BG)** – If China targets U.S. farm products again, these get hit.



**What I’m watching:**

📌 Will China retaliate with rare earth metal export bans? (Impacts TSLA, NVDA, QCOM)

📌 Do inflation expectations rise, pushing Fed policy hawkish? (Bad for rate-sensitive stocks)

📌 Does Trump backtrack on any tariffs? (A la 2019)

📌 Will domestic manufacturing gains **outweigh** supply chain disruptions?

I’d love to hear counterpoints. Which stocks do you think will **outperform or underperform** in Trump’s Trade War 2.0?",251,185,1742363708.0,2025-03-19T05:55:08+00:00,t3_1jeqaup,stocks
241,NVDA,NVDA: Groot N1 our foundation model for humanoid robots will be open source,"It was announced on stage as the last big news of Jensen's presentation.

&gt;Nvidia is releasing what it’s calling an AI foundation model for humanoid robotics.

&gt; Announced at GTC 2025, the model, dubbed Groot N1, is a “generalist” model — trained on synthetic data and real data. Nvidia said that Groot N1 features a “dual system architecture” for “thinking fast and slow,” inspired by human cognitive processes.
&gt; 
&gt; Groot N1’s slow thinking system lets a robot perceive and reason about its environment and instructions and then plan the right actions to take, according to Nvidia. As for the fast thinking system, it translates the aforementioned plan into robotic actions, including the ability to manipulate objects and execute multi-step sequences.
&gt; 
&gt; The model is available in open source, Nvidia said. Alongside the model, Nvidia is releasing simulation frameworks and blueprints for generating synthetic training data. ([Tech Crunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/18/nvidia-announces-groot-n1-a-foundation-model-for-humanoid-robotics/))

The ""buying the dip"" effect continuing.","In the weekend, Scott Bessent said ""I’ve been in the investment business for 35 years, and I can tell you that corrections are healthy. They’re normal."". As a result, the futures market opened negative. However, after the U.S. Stock Market opened, The S&amp;P 500 turned positive. On the Nasdaq side, Tesla dragged the index down and dropped more than 6%. It recovered some losses by the end of the day.

The S&amp;P500 hit 6,147 on February 19. Then the index dropped 5,504 on March 13. It remains below the 200-day EMA. Compared to the previous 2 times on below, if the market made 2 consecutive positive closes, the uptrend will continue. Today, The S&amp;P 500 hit 5.703 which is the 200-day EMA and then declined. It closed at at 5,677. I think, we can hit the 50-day EMA at around 5,850 at least.

🔷 Apple dropped more than 10%.
🔷 Nvidia surged nearly 8%. 
🔷 Intel had a strong performance after announcing a new CEO and gaining over 16% in a week.

Overall, this week was negative.

Mar. 7, 2025 Closes,
🔷 S&amp;P500: 5,770.20
🔷 Nasdaq: 18,196.22
🔷 DJI: 42,801.72

Mar. 14, 2025 Closes,
🔷 S&amp;P500: 5,638.94 (-2.27%)
🔷 Nasdaq: 17,754.09 (-2.37%)
🔷 DJI: 41,488.19 (-3.16%)

Day-by-Day Standouts;
Monday: Selling pressure was extremely strong. The Nasdaq dropped 727 points. It's biggest single-day decline since COVID crash on Mar. 16, 2020. 🔴
Tuesday: A quiet day. The stock market awaited key data releases on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. But, it's slightly negative. 🔴
Wednesday: CPI was released. The monthly estimate was 0.3%, but it came to 0.2%. The yearly estimate was 2.9%, but it dropped to 2.8%. This was perfect for stock market, because it's increased expectations of a rate cut. As a result, stock markets are surged more than 1%. 🟢
Tuesday: After CPI, PPI also came in below estimates. Core PPI turned negative (-0.1%) and the yearly dropped from 3.6% to 3.4%. However, tariff concerns created pressure and then the stock market dropped 2%. 🔴
Friday: The government shutdown reduced fears. The stock market jumped 2% to close the week on a strong. 🟢

S&amp;P500 hit 6147 on February 19, 2025, but has now dropped to 5,638.94. The lowest level at this week was 5,504.65. That means, the index dropped slight more than 10%. S&amp;P500 is below the 200-day EMA. 

If we can get 2 day consecutive positive close, some of money from other assets like gold may join the game into the stock market. For now, economic data supports the stock market, but we shouldn't forget that President Trump’s is more important than all the data and technical indicators.

	•	P/E TTM at 100 → Overvalued, just like Palantir before its pullback.
	•	Rapid, unsustainable rally → No consolidation, increasing crash risk.

Europe Defense has a lot of traction, but it’s not the same cashflow as NVIDIA brings in. With a PEG of 11, it’s a euphoria scenario. Also a mere 7.19% profit margin doesn’t make it justifiable for earnings growth. Momentum-driven bubbles don’t last forever. With stretched valuations and overheated technicals, a sharp correction toward €1100-900 is likely as profit-taking kicks in.

244,NVDA,"TSMC pitched Intel foundry JV to Nvidia, AMD and Broadcom","TSMC (2330.TW), has pitched U.S. chip designers Nvidia (NVDA.O),, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O), and Broadcom (AVGO.O), about taking stakes in a joint venture that would operate Intel's (INTC.O), factories, according to four sources familiar with the matter.

Under the proposal, the Taiwanese chipmaking giant would run the operations of Intel's foundry division, which makes chips adapted for the needs of customers, but it would not own more than 50%, the sources said. Qualcomm (QCOM.O), has also been pitched by TSMC, according to one of the sources and a separate source.

The talks, which are at an early stage, come after U.S. President Donald Trump's administration requested TSMC, the world's leading contract chipmaker, assist in turning around the troubled U.S. industrial icon, the sources said on condition of anonymity because the talks are not public.

The details of the plan for TSMC to take no more than a 50% stake and its overtures to potential partners are being reported for the first time.

Any final deal - the value of which is unclear - would need approval from the Trump administration, which does not want Intel or its foundry division to be fully foreign-owned, the sources said.

Intel, TSMC, Nvidia, AMD and Qualcomm declined to comment. The White House and Broadcom did not respond to requests for comment.

At stake is the future of the U.S. chipmaking giant, whose shares have lost more than half of their value in the last year.

Intel reported a 2024 net loss of $18.8 billion, its first since 1986, driven by large impairments. The foundry division's property and plant equipment had a book value of $108 billion as of December 31, according to a company filing.

Intel stock rose more than 7% in premarket U.S. trading on Wednesday, while Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom and Qualcomm were up between 0.8% and 1.5%. TSMC closed about 1.8% higher in Taiwan.

Trump is keen to revive Intel's fortunes, as he seeks to boost American advanced manufacturing, three of the sources said.

The sources said TSMC's joint venture pitch was made to potential backers before the Taiwanese chipmaker announced with Trump on March 3 that the company planned to make a fresh $100 billion investment in the United States that involves building five additional chip facilities there in coming years.

Talks about the joint venture over Intel's foundry division have since continued, the three sources said, with TSMC looking to have more than one chip designer as a partner.

Multiple companies have expressed interest in buying parts of Intel, but two of the four sources said the U.S. company has rejected discussions about selling its chip design house separately from the foundry division.

Qualcomm has exited earlier discussions to buy all or part of Intel, according to those people and a separate source.

Intel board members have backed a deal and held negotiations with TSMC, while some executives are firmly opposed, according to two sources.

Intel's contract manufacturing business, or foundry division, was a crucial part of former CEO Pat Gelsinger's effort to save Intel. Gelsinger was forced out by the board in December, which named two interim co-CEOs who have mothballed its forthcoming AI chip.

Any deals between historical rivals TSMC and Intel would face major challenges and be costly and laborious. The two companies currently use vastly different processes, chemicals, and chipmaking tool setups at their factories, according to separate sources at the companies.

Intel has previously had manufacturing partnerships with Taiwan's UMC (2303.TW), and Israel's Tower Semiconductor (TSEM.TA), that could offer a precedent for the two companies to operate together, but it remains unclear how such a partnership would work regarding trade manufacturing secrets.

The Taiwanese chipmaker wants potential investors in the joint venture to also be Intel advanced manufacturing customers, according to one of the sources.

Reuters reported last week, citing sources, that Nvidia and Broadcom are running manufacturing tests with Intel, using the company's most advanced production techniques, known as 18A. AMD is also evaluating whether Intel's 18A manufacturing process is suitable for it.

But 18A has been an area of contention in negotiations between Intel and TSMC, two sources said. During talks in February, Intel executives told TSMC that its advanced 18A manufacturing technology was superior to TSMC's 2-nanometer process, according to those sources.

374,NVDA,A useful “selling” technique to prevent loss,"I consider myself a good performing individual investor both in stock market and in real estate market. Have beaten spx 500 constantly and have a good performance in real estate investments too. 

One of the most useful techniques I use in investing is “don’t sell at loss if you don’t need that money urgently“. I barely sell. I still hold my baba and bidu stocks at loss at this moment and I think holding a stock that you believe in is the best technique in investing in stocks. I consider investing my stocks like investing in real estate. You don’t really wanna sell a house every day, right? I don’t chase after momentum stocks neither. 

My other more unique technique is the “downward bias” technique. If my month 0 paper loss of my entire portfolio is not more than the paper gain of my entire portfolio a month ago, I don’t sell any of my positions. For example, if my current loss is 4% vs my month ago position is 16%, I consider the market is still in an upward trend and I don’t touch my major positions. 

This technique really shall help me rule out the market short term volatility and help me “do nothing” in stock market when market is volatile. 

and btw, I digged myself in for the last 2 trading days and bought a little more in bitcoin, nvda, software and electrification stocks. 

Feel free to share your techniques if you consider yourself a good investor that has achieved more return than sp500 constantly ",0,11,1741715951.0,2025-03-11T17:59:11+00:00,t3_1j8x32p,StockMarket

Yesterday, mainly traded TSLA on the overnight exchanges. It had the largest move and got down to around $212. Overall a lot of negative sentiment ranging from boycotts and Elon controversies.

247,NVDA,Trumps tariffs. Which companies might avoid pain?,"I am hoping to initiate a discussion about specifics here. What companies and industries could suffer the most from from these tariffs. For example a common narrative I am seeing is 

“due too uncertainty companies will halt hiring and due to increased operating costs companies will stop advertising”

Meaning companies like Meta or Reddit will suffer.

But then in the case if companies likes NVDA, the AI front runner. How will tariffs affect the sales of chips? 

Basically if you have a company and a thesis of how it will be specifically positively or negatively by this somewhat extreme environment.

**Catalyst:** Earnings. Reported EPS of $1.60 vs. $1.49 exp, revenue of $14.92B vs. $14.61B expected. AVGO gave strong guidance of $14.9B vs $14.76B. Cited strong growth due to AI chips and/infrastructure components for training AI.

**Technicals:** Watching to see if we break $200 level today.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** I think we're seeing the AI hype become more concentrated in the ""winners"" of the AI race now. There are some companies that ARE citing falling demand for their AI related products while others are stating that demand is still robust. Likely going to see greater consolidation in the future. Major chipmakers like Broadcom are benefiting from hyperscaler investments in AI over the 3 year AI boom.

382,NVDA,Weekly recap 🥵 Is Nvidia still a play? SMCI dip BUY or BYE?,"🔸 Salesforce (CRM): Q4 free cash flow up 31% YoY to $12.4B, AI-related ARR hits $900M (+120% YoY), and Agentforce transactions skyrocketed 24x in a single quarter to 5,000 deals. Yet, the stock dipped 4%+ post-earnings. Analysts see the pullback as a solid buying opp with valuation looking more attractive.

🔸 Home Depot (HD): Q4 revenue hit $39.7B (+14.1% YoY), beating by $638M, but the FY25 sales growth guidance of 2.8% missed expectations (3.4%). EPS forecast cut 2% to $14.94. With a stretched P/E of 25.2x, the stock faces 25% downside risk, and fair value could be around $285.16.

🔸 Hims &amp; Hers (HIMS): Stock tanked 25% over GLP-1 drug shortage fears, but let’s not ignore subscription growth of 269.49% since 2021 and FY25 revenue guidance of $2.3B-$2.4B, beating estimates. DCF model suggests fair value at $80—this one looks seriously undervalued.

🔸 Nvidia (NVDA): Q4 data center revenue now 91% of total (+93% YoY), free cash flow at $15.5B (+38% YoY), and FY26 Q1 revenue guidance of $43.0B (+65% YoY). Minor gross margin dip triggered some selling, but with a $50B buyback plan, long-term bulls have every reason to stay confident.

🔸 Rocket Lab (RKLB): Q4 revenue $132.4M (+120% YoY), but Neutron rocket launch delayed to late 2025, and Q1 revenue guidance of $120M (+29% YoY) came in light. Stock is down 12% post-earnings, with 10.4% short interest—bears are circling.

**Catalyst:** Trump has called for an end to the CHIPS Act Subsidy Program (instead preferring tariffs).

**Technicals:** Short biased. Obviously this takes away a lot of investment in semis companies. Extremely negative catalyst but unlikely it will get repealed due to how much bipartisan support it had.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The CHIPS and Science Act gave $280B in new funding to boost domestic research/manufacturing of semis in the US, and also aimed to strengthen supply chain resilience against China and widely considered to be a success because it spurred the development/dominance in the semis sector in America.

**Risks:** If this gets repealed, we're likely going to see a pretty large pullback in the semis. Obviously this is dependent on what the tariffs Trump touts will do as well.

**Catalyst:** The Trump administration is considering granting relief from the recently imposed 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports for products that comply with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).

**Technicals:** We've seen all three stocks (GM especially) make gains due to this announcement, will watch at open for volume.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The automotive industry in US/Canada/Mexico involves the most economic/manufacturing cooperation in the USMCA, they're the most obvious beneficiaries of this potential catalyst.

**Risks:** If they don't actually give relief, then will likely pullback- cars are one of the most affected products of tariffs and pretty much every car company has spoken about tariffs on their earnings calls.

**Catalyst:** Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has indicated that Trump plans to grant the main biggest CC a ""unique status"" within the Bitcoin reserve strategy, which will be unveiled at the White House CC Summit on Friday.

**Technicals:** We've seen the underlying spike close to 8-9% since yesterday, watching $90K level. Interested to see how we go prior to the actual summit.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Obviously an extremely bullish catalyst, we've bounced strongly off the $80K level recently. I usually trade through the ETFs as needed, and HOOD/Coinbase serve as proxies in case the ETFs aren't liquid or have already moved.

**Risks:** Worth waiting for the catalyst and watching the CC Summit on Friday. I personally see this more of a ""buy on hype"" kind of catalyst, unless there's an announcement of something extremely bullish I'm not sure how much more this will move the needle.

**Catalyst:** Trump has announced initiatives aimed at strengthening the U.S. shipbuilding industry to counter China's dominance, spoke about the creation of a White House Office of Shipbuilding and the introduction of special tax incentives.

**Technicals:** None that I'm particularly interested in, this is a longer-term play.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** China produces over half of the world's merchant vessels, this is more of a play to reduce reliance on foreign-shipping.

**Risks:** There's a chance that this will never happen, Trump tried to create a ""Cybersecurity Department"" in his first term but that was never formally created and we kept those duties spread out between the FBI/DHS/NSA.

**Catalyst:** Reports preliminary February China deliveries of 30,688 cars, down close to 50% from last year.

**Technicals:** Overall a brutal delivery report. TSLA has been on a slide since post-election highs and frankly shows no real sign of recovery. Looking for a small bounce in this stock but I don't think there is much potential for long-term recovery.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** TSLA's EV sales have been declining in China mainly due to BYD, which are considered to make better cars for far cheaper outside the US. The US has a 100% EV tariff for non-US made EV vehicles.

**Risks:** BYD has been eating TSLA's lunch outside of the US. I truly don't see TSLA retaining dominance as the EV of choice outside the US.

**Catalyst:** Okta beat earnings expectations with EPS of $.78 vs $.74,gave guidance that supports EPS of $3.20 vs $2.93. (Also note that CRWD reports today but are not direct competitors)

**Technicals:** Watching $100 level.

**Catalyst:** Nvidia is front and center as the stock most affected by tariff concerns.

**Technicals:** Watching $110 level. Note that this is the lowest it's been since September 2024. We have millions of shares come in in the first 2 minutes of the open so watch for that.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Not much to speak of that hasn't been said before, but NVDA is heavily affected by tariffs and the CHIPS Act, with additional scrutiny that it is somehow bypassing export controls and having their chips go into China.

**Risks:** MORE trade disputes, more potential export restrictions, (Trump has cited he wants to strengthen export controls for NVDA).

240,NVDA,How I used historical fundamental data and BigQuery to transform ANY LLM into a super powerful financial analysis tool,"[*This article was originally posted on Medium*](https://medium.com/p/40f697092399)

People are far too impressed by the most basic shit.

I saw some finance bro in Twitter rant about how Grok was the best thing since sliced bread. This LLM, developed by xAi, has built-in web search and reasoning capabilities… and people are losing their shit at what they *perceive* it can do for financial analysis tasks.

[Pic: Grok is capable of thinking and searching the web natively](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*m7K-Wy3RVeEs91HUnX40FQ.png)

Like yes, this is better than GPT, which doesn’t have access to real-time information, but you can build a MUCH better financial assistant in about an hour.

And yes, not only is it extremely easy, but it it also works with ANY LLM. Here’s how you can build your own assistant for any task that requires real-time data.

# What is Grok?

If you know anything at all about large language models, you know that they don't have access to real-time information.

That is, until Grok 3.

You see, unlike DeepSeek which is boasting an inexpensive architecture, Elon Musk decided that bigger is still better, and spent over $3 billion on 200,000 NVIDIA supercomputers (H100s).

He was leaving no stone left unturned.

The end result is a large language model that is superior to every other model. It boasts a 1 million token context window. AND it has access to the web in the form of Twitter.

[Pic: The performance of Grok 3 compared to other large language models](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*7k_ekiQcLlWbM7_zZrMfIg.png)

However, people are exaggerating some of its capabilities far too much, especially for tasks that require real-time information, like finance.

While Grok 3 can do basic searches, you can build a MUCH better (and cheaper) LLM with real-time access to financial data.

It’s super easy.

# Solving the Inherent Problem with LLMs for Financial Analysis

Even language models like Grok are unable to perform complex analysis.

Complex analysis requires precise data. If I wanted a list of AI stocks that increased their free cash flow every quarter for the past 4 quarters, I need a *precise* way to look at the past 4 quarters and come up with an answer.

Searching the web just outright isn’t enough.

However, with a little bit of work, we can build a language model-agnostic financial super-genius that gives accurate, fact-based answers based on data.

Doing this is 3 EASY steps:

* Retrieving financial data for every US stock and uploading the data to BigQuery
* Building an LLM wrapper to query for the data
* Format the results of the query to the LLM

Let’s go into detail for each step.

# Storing and uploading financial data for every US stock using EODHD

Using a [high-quality fundamental data provider like EODHD](https://eodhd.com/r?ref=nexustrade), we can query for accurate, real-time financial information within seconds.

[Pic: The Best API for Historical Stock Market Prices and Fundamental Financial Data | Free Trial API](https://eodhd.com/r?ref=nexustrade)

We do this by calling the historical data endpoint. This gives us all of the historical data for a particular stock, including earnings estimates, revenue, net income, and more.

Note, that the quality of the data matters tremendously. Sources like [EODHD](https://eodhd.com/r?ref=FU1UY2HM) are the perfect balance between cost effectiveness and accuracy. If we use shit-tier data, we can’t be surprised when our LLM gives us shit-tier responses.

Now, there is a bit of work to clean and combine the data into a BigQuery suitable format. In particular, because the volume of data that EODHD provides, we have to do some filtering.

Fortunately, I’ve already done all of the work and released it open-source for free!

[Pic: GitHub - austin-starks/FinAnGPT-Pro: A script for creating your very own AI-Powered stock screener](https://github.com/austin-starks/FinAnGPT-Pro)

We just have to run the script

    ts-node upload.ts

And the script will automatically run for every stock and upload their financial data.

Now, there is some setup involved. You need to create a Google cloud account and enable BigQuery (assuming we want to benefit from the fast reads that BigQuery provides). But the setup process like this is like any other website. It’ll take a couple minutes, at max.

After we have the data uploaded, we can process to step 2.

# Use an LLM to generate a database query

This is the step that makes our LLM better than Grok or any other model for financial analysis.

Instead of searching the web for results, we’ll use the LLM to search for the data in our database. With this, we can get *exactly* the info we want. We can find info on specific stocks or even find novel stock opportunities.

Here’s how.

**Step 1) Create an account on** [**Requesty**](https://app.requesty.ai/join?ref=e0603ee5)

[Requesty](https://app.requesty.ai/join?ref=e0603ee5) allows you to change between different LLM providers without having to create 10 different accounts. This includes the best models for financial analysis, including Gemini Flash 2 and OpenAI o3-mini.

[Pic: Google just ANNIHILATED DeepSeek and OpenAI with their new Flash 2.0 model](https://nexustrade.io/blog/google-just-annihilated-deepseek-and-openai-with-their-new-flash-20-model-20250205)

Once we create a Requesty account, we have to create a system prompt.

**Step 2) Create an initial LLM prompt**

[Pic: A Draft of our System Prompt for an AI Financial Assistant](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*m4cHrdGJQPp-k61c2elVRQ.png)

Our next step is to create a system prompt. This gives our model enough context to answer our questions and helps guide its response.

A good system prompt will:

* Have all of the necessary context to answer financial questions (such as the schemas and table names)
* Have a list of constraints (for example, we might cap the maximum output to 50 companies)
* Have a list of examples the model can follow

After we create an initial prompt, we can run it to see the results.

    ts-node chat.ts

Then, we can iteratively improve the prompt by running it, seeing the response, and making modifications.

**Step 3) Iterate and improve on the prompt**

[Pic: The output of the LLM](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*lr51xLogkWYjFI-4NJif0g.png)

Once we have an initial prompt, we can iterate on it and improve it by testing on a wide array of questions. Some questions the model should be able to answer include:

* What stocks have the highest net income?
* What stocks have increased their grossProfit every quarter for the past 4 quarters?
* What is MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL, and Meta’s average revenue for the past 5 years?

After each question, we’ll execute the query that the model generates and see the response. If it doesn’t look right, we’ll inspect it, iterate on it, and add more examples to steer its output.

Once we’ve perfected our prompt, we’re ready to glue everything together for an easy-to-read, human-readable response!

# Glue everything together and give the user an answer

[Pic: The final, formatted output of the LLM](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*qw3g17fk_Fk9b2xMp2TDZQ.png)

Finally, once we have a working system that can query for financial data, we can build an LLM super-intelligent agent that incorporates it!

To do this, we’ll simply forward the results from the LLM into another request that formats it.

As I mentioned, this process is not hard, is more accurate than LLMs like Grok, and is very inexpensive. If you care about searching through financial datasets in seconds, you can save yourself an hour of work by working off of what I open-sourced.

# NexusTrade – a free, UI-based alternative for financial analysis and algorithmic trading

NexusTrade is built on top of this AI technology, but can do a lot more than this script. It’s filled with features that makes financial analysis and algorithmic trading easy for retail investors.

For example, instead of asking basic financial analysis questions, you can ask something like the following:

&gt;What AI stocks that increased their FCF every quarter in the past 4 quarters have the highest market cap?

[Pic: Asking the AI for AI stocks that have this increasing free cash flow](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*sfgB04xGINOJ11X2e5WCZQ.png)

Additionally, you can use the AI to quickly test algorithmic trading strategies.

&gt;Create a strategy to buy UNH, Uber and Upstart. Do basic RSI strategies, but limit buys to once every 3 days.

[Pic: Creating a strategy with AI](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*tQJfeq1QVsYGog-nXcHj5A.png)

Finally, if you need ideas on how to get started, the AI can quickly point you to successful strategies to get inspiration from. You can say:

&gt;What are the best public portfolios?

[Pic: The best public portfolios](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*swrlpAQA8LDuBWaRhyjrjA.png)

# Concluding Thoughts

While a mainstream LLM being built to access the web is cool, it’s not as useful as setting up your own custom assistant. A purpose-built assistant allows you to access the exact data you need quickly and allows you to perform complex analysis.

This article demonstrates that.

It’s not hard, nor time-consuming, and the end result is an AI that you control, at least in regards to price, privacy, and functionality.

However, if the main thing that matters to you is getting quick, accurate analysis quickly, and using those analysis results to beat the market, then a platform like NexusTrade might be your safest bet. Because, in addition to analyzing stocks, NexusTrade allows you to:

* Create, test, and deploy algorithmic trading strategies
* Browse a library of real-time trading rules and copy the trades of successful traders
* Perform even richer analysis with custom tags, such as the ability to filter by AI stocks.

But regardless if you use Grok, build your own LLM, or use a pre-built one, one thing’s for sure is that if you’re integrating AI into your trading workflow, you’re gonna be doing a lot better than the degenerate that gambles with no strategy.

386,NVDA,Why did the market almost as a whole take a hit across the board at 4pm today?,"Looking at today’s trends, it’s pretty clear that around 4 PM EST, the market took a noticeable hit almost across the board. This wasn’t just an isolated sector or a single stock tanking—there was an obvious triggering event that caused a broad sell-off.

From what I can gather, there are a few likely culprits:

1. **Nvidia’s Earnings &amp; AI Sector Pullback** – Nvidia reported earnings that initially looked solid, but their guidance on margins didn’t meet the market’s expectations. Given how much weight Nvidia carries in the AI-driven rally, a dip in NVDA caused ripple effects throughout tech and semiconductor stocks.
2. **Tariff Announcement &amp; Trade War Concerns** – The White House announced new tariffs on imports from China, Mexico, and Canada. Markets don’t react well to protectionist policies, and this sparked concerns about retaliation and supply chain disruptions.
3. **End-of-Month Positioning &amp; Liquidity Issues** – Since we’re closing out February, some institutions could be rebalancing portfolios, locking in gains, or reducing exposure ahead of upcoming economic data. This might have amplified the dip.

The S&amp;P 500 dropped about 1.6%, Nasdaq took a harder hit at 2.8%, and the Dow slid around 0.4%. So while Nvidia’s earnings miss might have been the spark, the tariff announcement probably fueled the broader downturn.

That said, I’m curious if anyone else caught something I missed—was there another macro event, options expiration, or something else that compounded the move?",699,335,1740712172.0,2025-02-28T03:09:32+00:00,t3_1izy2ft,StockMarket

**Catalyst:** Reported earnings with EPS of $0.89 vs. $0.84 exp and revenue of $39.33B vs. $38.05B exp.

Provided strong guidance, anticipating revenue of $43B vs  $41.78B exp.

Performance is driven by robust demand for Nvidia's Blackwell AI chips, positioning the company to maintain its growth trajectory in the AI sector.

Overall a good earnings report, we're not going to see the stock explode like we did previously with the earnings beats.

**Technicals:** Watching $135 level, other than that I don't anticipate a major selloff due to the earnings news- maybe due to the jobs/macro news instead.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Overall not as explosive as the market wanted it to be. Growth was largely driven by advancements in AI (as usual).

Company said they were still demand constrained, even with export controls.

**Risks:** Potential supply chain disruptions/geopolitical tensions, greater export controls as mentioned previously, and increased competition.

**Catalyst:** A recent short report has been released, alleging that the company's application functions as spyware.

This follows a similar report from approximately a week ago.

**Technicals:** Yesterday I was mainly interested in being long if we broke $300 and had a recovery- I read both of the short reports and they said very similar things, so I thought the selloff was overblown.

Bought a little below $290, still holding. Will likely bail if we break $300 again.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** APP is a mobile tech company that helps devs market/monetize their apps through mobile advertising and marketing platforms, recently announced they were using AI.

**Risks:** The short report allegations are true and they essentially get banned from the Google App/Apple App Store.

**Catalyst:** U.S. health officials are reevaluating a $590 million contract awarded to MRNA for bird flu vaccines.

**Technicals:** We saw a decent dip (roughly 5%) in MRNA afterhours yesterday, not too interested in this further unless we see further headlines about the contract being pulled completely.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** MRNA had massive growth during 2020 for being one of the main manufacturers of the COVID vaccine- right now bird flu is being touted as the next potential big pandemic to vaccinate against.

**Risks:** Cancellation is the the real catalyst after this news, or if the contract is awarded to a different company.

**Catalyst:** SNOW beat expectations, EPS of $0.30 vs. $0.18 exp. and revenue of $986.8M vs. $957.6M exp.

The company also provided an optimistic outlook, projecting current-quarter product revenue between $955M-$960M, driven by increasing demand for AI-related products.

**Technicals:** Interested in $190 level.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** SNOW is a cloud-based data warehousing company and benefits from the demand for AI/ML solutions.

AI is compute intensive which means they can charge more for their services. Also announced integration with Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service.

**Risks:** SNOW doesn't generate GAAP profits still.

**Catalyst:** Some catalysts today: Deepseek cuts API pricing by 75%, NVDA is reporting earnings, ChatGPT is doing a limited rollout of ChatGPT 4.5, META considering $200B AI data center.

NVDA reporting earnings is the main catalyst today and decides the immediate direction of the market.

**Technicals:** Mainly interested in seeing if NVDA misses revenue (unlikely) or if they say anything significant due to new export controls which I talked about yesterday (strengthening of CHIPS Act export controls to China).

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** NVDA leads in semis design, is a multi-billion dollar company, etc.

**Risks:** I'm currently positioned defensively (sold calls against my position since I have a decent cost basis from back when DeepSeek news released, so overall will just sit on hands and get out of my position if the earnings are bad).

**Catalyst:** (Old news) New report shows demand is falling in Europe, with sales dropping a precipitous 45% in January.

**Technicals:** Massive selloff since post-election highs- $300 was a significant level I was watching at the time and we exploded past that, so interested to see if we're able to hold above it.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** BYD is a major competitor to TSLA and will likely overtake them in the future, and Musk's political actions are seen as controversial in Europe.

**Risks:** Musk.

**Catalyst:** The CC market is experiencing a selloff mainly due to proposed tariffs and the hack at Bybit, resulting in the loss of \~$1.5 billion.

**Technicals:** Not too interested in playing this long- still watching to see how we perform but the sell off has continued, waiting for a larger move still.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Hacks increase fear of storing on centralized exchanges (like Coinbase), proposed tariffs affecting digital assets can lead to market volatility. Interestingly enough, ByBit was (theorized) to be hacked by North Korea.

**Catalyst:** China plans to inject at least $55 billion into its largest banks in the coming months as part of a broader stimulus package, Yuan printer go brrrrr. This move is intended to supplement the core Tier 1 capital of China’s six largest state-owned banks. This is the first bank recapitalization since the global financial crisis. 10T yuan (\~$1.4T) debt package to support local government financing and economic stability.

**Technicals:** We've seen a decent upmove on a lot of Chinese stocks due to this, we'll see how the market reacts.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** China has been going through a spending crisis, and the government's decision to inject substantial capital into its major banks is a move to strengthen liquidity. This initiative aims to enhance the lending capacity of banks, support local government financing, and stabilize the broader economy. It's a (pre) bailout baby.

**Risks:** This does signal that China sees economic weakness, such as lack of demand due to their real estate sector they've traditionally leaned on for consumer growth/investment. Is this a long term fix? Who knows, but it worked for the US!

**Catalyst:** They finally filed! Really cutting it close there lol. The company has faced allegations of accounting irregularities. These allegations, along with a failure to file specific financial forms have been a plague for the past year on the stock price. 

**Technicals:** We've seen a 20% move AH, so worth watching at open to see if we move further. Other than that, watching $50/$55 level.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Was at threat of delisting from the NASDAQ but now they're safe baby.

**Risks:** People getting out, or the filing being rejected/advised to resubmit. The latter is a massive catalyst but low probability.

Earnings: NVDA, CRM, SNOW, AI",0,1,1740579407.0,2025-02-26T14:16:47+00:00,t3_1iyoi4g,StockMarket
392,NVDA,NVDA: Earnings 2/26/2025,"NVDA earnings today are going to be a big deal, especially since AI hype is still strong. If they post another blowout quarter, it could push tech even higher. But the bigger question is sustainability. How much longer can Nvidia keep up the growth before AI hardware demand slows?

On DeepSeek and AI recursively improving itself is a real concern. If AI can optimize AI models, it could rapidly reduce the cost of training and inference. That means companies like Nvidia might sell fewer high-margin GPUs over time, as AI becomes more efficient and requires less hardware. Right now, Nvidia benefits from the fact that training AI models is extremely expensive and computer-intensive, but if we hit a point where AI starts designing better chips, optimizing training algorithms, or even reducing power consumption drastically, then the return on investment (ROI) for Nvidia’s customers could shrink.

We’ve already seen this happen in other tech cycles. Cloud computing lowered the need for on-prem servers. Software automation reduced demand for human coders in certain areas. AI optimizing itself could push the industry into a deflationary spiral where each new breakthrough leads to lower costs and less revenue per cycle. Nvidia could try to pivot by offering more AI services (like their AI cloud), but at some point, hardware demand might peak.

Do you think we’re hitting the peak of AI hardware demand soon, or does Nvidia still have a few years left of growth?

**Catalyst:** The Trump administration is planning to strengthen semiconductor export controls to China, aiming to strengthen the CHIPS act from Biden's term.

Additionally, DeepSeek is accelerating the release of its new AI model, R2, following the success of its R1 model. (Most of their training is done on NVDA chips)

**Technicals:** Mainly interested to see if we can hold above $130 for NVDA- note that earnings are tomorrow so the short-term performance of the stock hinges on that. Currently long and sold 155C to hedge my position against it.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** We've seen the CHIPS act actually affect the way that semiconductor companies sell to China- most of those restrictions are bypassed, so this strengthening of export controls might actually affect the industry.

**Risks:** More export controls may lead to China giving tariffs in retaliation- but again, most semis are supply constrained rather than demand constrained so I don't see it as a significant catalyst until more details are released.

**Catalyst:** BABA has introduced its own AI reasoning model within the Qwen framework (like how META has the Llama framework), while we have a surge of all Chinese stock performance following the Chinese government's announcement of liquidity measures.

**Technicals:** It seems as if we've peaked (BABA has gone up close to 50% since the start of this month) for most Chinese stocks in the past few days, I would be interested in being short but I was on vacation this weekend. Interested in shorting BABA specifically if we make another large up move like we did on 2/20.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** BABA is one of the major competitors that is working on AI models, and is notably using NVDA cards to train its models. 

**Risks:** Mainly tariff news and news from other rivals with better models. Straightforward.

**Catalyst:** Previously, PLTR faced concerns due to defense budget cuts and CEO Alex Karp reducing his stake in the company. We've seen it make a massive run from retail and fall just as quickly.

**Technicals:** Interested in playing a small bounce- we're up \~10% since last earnings report (and pre-crazy move), there is potential for a small bounce here but only entering a small position since it looks like we bottomed early premarket today. 

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Trump directed the government to make significant cuts to the defense budget. (This is a far more significant catalyst than Alex Karp selling shares)

**Risks:** PLTR lives and dies on defense contract money, so obviously further cuts/expansions will affect stock price.

**Catalyst:** The CC market is experiencing heightened volatility due to proposed tariffs and a significant security breach at Bybit, resulting in the loss of approximately $1.5 billion.

**Technicals:** Not too interested in playing this long- still watching to see how we perform but the sell off resulting in the biggest Coin going to $90K has me watching the stock related proxies that deal with the market. 

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** CC platforms are highly susceptible to regulatory changes and security incidents.

Proposed tariffs affecting digital assets can lead to market vol, while large-scale hacks undermine investor trust and lead to sell-offs in the market as it spreads fear and people wanting to cash out.

**Risks:** Regulatory interventions impose additional compliance costs and operational constraints on CC exchanges.

Security breaches not only result in financial losses but also lead to decreased user adoption and revenue.

Most interesting news today is the hope that the meeting between Russian/US officials may end the three-year war in Ukraine, in addition to release of the Grok-3 model from xAI (Elon Musk's AI startup.)

**Catalyst:** Elon Musk's AI startup, xAI, has unveiled its latest model, Grok-3, claiming it surpasses competitors like GPT-4o, Google Gemini, DeepSeek V3, and Claude.

These assertions have not been independently verified by the open sourcen community but it wouldn't be surprising if it could surpass 4o (the model is close to a year old now)

**Technicals:** No real level I've been watching in NVDA, already positioned long. Note that xAI uses NVDA GPU's specifically in their super computer.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** We've seen a very strong recovery since the Deepseek fears caused a selloff. Personally I don't think xAI will cause the same effect that Deepseek did, but I think that the semis are a winner of this again.

**Risks:** Unverified performance claims may lead to skepticism among investors and potential customers, impacting adoption rates and market trust. XAI has a “Colossus supercomputer,” for training AI, which it said last year was utilizing a cluster of 100,000 advanced Nvidia GPUs for AI training.

Today, the company revealed that it doubled the size of its GPU cluster for the training of Grok 3.

**Catalyst:** HEES has confirmed a $105 per share acquisition offer from Herc Rentals, surpassing the previous $92 per share bid from United Rentals.

**Technicals:** Watching $100 level. They've accepted the bid so we might see trading closer to that bid price in the near future.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Equipment rental industry is witnessing consolidation due to decelerating growth since 2023 (other than that nothing explosive)

**Catalyst:** Nike has announced a new brand collaboration with SKIMS, launching a line called NikeSKIMS.

**Technicals:** Watching $75 level.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** SKIMS is pretty popular- mainly does underwear/loungewear/shapewear but this might be more focused on athleisure. This could potentially make a difference in NKE sales- SKIMS also collaborated with The North Face in the past, so worth keeping track of this for future catalysts in case they work with other brands.

**Catalyst:** Unconfirmed reports suggest that President Trump plans to demand $500 billion from Ukraine and seek U.S. control over the country's mineral resources.

These claims have not been reported by major U.S. news outlets but have appeared in international media (from India, Canada, UK)

**Technicals:** This catalyst has been ""semi-leaked"" for the past week but not ""fully confirmed"", but we would likely see a selloff in defense stocks if true.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** These companies would go to the downside from an end to the Ukraine war, and spike if talks aren't successful.

**Risks:** Pretty much a ""wait for the news announcement"" kind of trade, pretty straightforward.

**Catalyst:** BIDU earnings with an EPS of ¥19.18 vs ¥14.13. Revenue of ¥34.1 billion vs ¥33.4 billion.

The company noted a 178% quarter-over-quarter increase in external API calls for its ERNIE AI bot and expects its AI investments to deliver more significant results in 2025.

Additionally, A.G. (their driverless car unit) has commenced 100% fully driverless operations across China since February.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The China techsector has been pretty competitive in AI and autonomous driving tech. Something interesting over the weekend was Xi meeting with private sector business leaders, signaling that China would be more friendly to business leaders (like Jack Ma)

**Risks:** It's China.

405,NVDA,Magnificent Eight - Net Income Comparison,"I thought it would be fun to plot the earnings (net income) history of the Magnificent Eight--the mega tech companies which exceed $1 trillion in market cap. I gathered information from Macrotrends, which has earnings report dating back to early 2009. For most cases that was sufficient: only Microsoft, Apple, and Alphabet generated meaningful earnings before then, and it still made up a relatively small protion in nominal terms. (Sources: [Apple](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAPL/apple/net-income), [Microsoft](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/MSFT/microsoft/net-income), [Alphabet](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GOOG/alphabet/net-income), [Meta](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/META/meta-platforms/net-income), [Amazon](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMZN/amazon/net-income), [Nvidia](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/NVDA/nvidia/net-income), [Broadcom](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AVGO/broadcom/net-income), [Tesla](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TSLA/tesla/net-income))

A couple things to note:
- Since Nvidia and Broadcom have yet to report for the quarter, I estimated net income based on consensus EPS. This likely underestimates since they reliably beat estimates (especially Nvidia).
- I plotted all the companies on the same vertical scale so that we could directly compare differences in their earnings.
- At $34.4B (likely generous since it excludes much of the early period when Tesla was not profitable), Tesla has generated less cumulative net income than Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, and Nvidia did in the last two quarters alone. I knew about the first three, but not the latter three. Moreover, it less net income in its entire corporate lifespan than Apple did **in last quarter alone**, in what was generally viewed as a disappointing quarter for Apple.
- The lead with which Apple has over the rest of the field is remarkable, although the overall trend appears flat. But I didn't appreciate the very strong seasonal trend with each release cycle leading into the holiday season.
- Alphabet actually takes the lead for the last year, topping $100 billion in net income.
- I was surprised to learn that despite a late start, Meta has actually made more money cumulatively than Amazon.

**Ticker:** [**PSX (Phillips 66)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PSX&amp;p=d)

**Catalyst:** Elliott Management has increased its stake in Phillips 66 to over $2.5 billion, advocating for operational changes to enhance shareholder value. Elliott is believed to push the company to spin off or sell midstream opportunities.

**Technicals:** We made a 6% move (just like when Elliott took a stake in BP), we may see another leg of movement during the day.

**Risks:** Spinning off a segment reduces income diversification (at the possible benefit of having a higher valuation multiple), more of a long-term investment risk than a short term one. In the short-term, expect a ton of marginal headlines that will move the stock up/down 1% depending on how they want to make changes.

**Catalyst:** LSCC reported EPS of $0.15 vs. $0.19 expected. Revenue of $117.4 million vs. $117 million expected. Provided strong indication of improving customer consumption and stronger future demand.

**Technicals:** Watching $65 level to the upside. Overall not interested in shorting this if I had to take a position. 

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The semiconductor industry is signaling increased demand and increased spending across all companies, which is bullish obviously. Despite slightly missing EPS they signaled a good enough outlook that the stock reacted positively to Earnings. LSCC makes low power FPGAs.

**Catalyst:** Following TMUS's announcement of compatibility with Starlink Beta, ASTS (a close competitor) experienced an 18% increase, with potential for further movement (both upside/downside) today, particularly around the $30 level.

**Technicals:** I'm leaning more towards pullback today, watching $30 level.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The satellite communications industry is rapidly evolving, with major players forming partnerships to expand global connectivity. Starlink is the biggest company out there, but ASTS moves whenever adoption news comes out, like it did previously with Verizon. 

**Risks:** Competition from entities like Starlink may pressure ASTS's market share and profitability in the future, especially when SpaceX is expected to IPO (eventually). Remember that ASTS has 5 satellites and is working on \~19 more.

**Catalyst:** Nothing significant today, but we saw a huge spike up to $117.75 yesterday, likely from comments made during the Paris AI summit. Currently short.

**Technicals:** Interested in $115 level as an add, on the short side. Watching $120 as the level to cover on.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** PLTR has made the mother of all moves recently, gaining 50% in the past 2 weeks. Most of that was from earnings, 

**Risks:** For a trade, I'm capping my risk at $120- everyone and their mother knows that PLTR is overvalued and run on hype at this point, and a move up to $100 from earnings might be tolerable but adding an extra 15% on top of that is irrational (in my opinion). Obviously there's significant retail interest in this stock, so will have to be agile and cognizant of what they're thinking as stock moves around.

News: [Us Initial Jobless Claims Pick Up But Stay Relatively Low](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-06/us-initial-jobless-claims-pick-up-but-stay-relatively-low)

**Catalyst:** Ford Motor Company reports .39 vs .34 expected, revenue of $48.2 vs 43.6B expected. Announces that profit could fall by $2B or more due to tariffs and lower EV demand.

**Technicals:** Pretty much broke the $10 level it's been trading around since August, watching to see if it'll sell off more by the open. Highly/infinitely liquid.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The entire automotive industry is challenged by tariffs. F guided lower for 2025.

**Risks:** Obviously these are one of the bigger movers from Mexico tariffs (most cars are assembled in Mexico then shipped to the US).

**Related Tickers:** GM, TSLA, STLA.

**Offhand Comments:** Ford's outlook reflects the broader industry's apprehension about geopolitical factors affecting operations and profitability. Interesting to see how other car companies react to earnings as well.

**Catalyst:** ARM reported EPS of $0.39 vs. $0.34 expected. Revenue of $983 million vs. $959M expected. Buoyed by Deepseek ban news, most likely as well.

**Technicals:** Was down roughly 8% after earnings, but seems to be somewhat recovering after Deepseek news.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Semiconductor sector is experiencing heightened demand, especially after PLTR's comments that the AI train will never stop. We're seeing growth in data center applications, the main driver of semis purchases.

**Risks:** Despite strong performance, Arm's lowered full-year revenue forecast has led to a 6% drop in its shares.

**Catalyst:** Roblox Corporation reported earnings with an EPS of -$0.33 vs. -$0.46 expected. Revenue of $988.2M vs. $967.2M expected.

**Technicals:** $50 is the clear level here, note that earnings were released premarket rather than aftermarket yesterday. Seems to be a massive overreaction selloff (but has recovered somewhat).

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The gaming industry is witnessing substantial growth, with increased user engagement and monetization strategies. Roblox's 32% year-over-year revenue increase reflects its expanding user base and effective monetization, despite missing revenue expectations.

**Risks:** IIRC Roblox isn't profitable yet- they're focusing on growth/revenue over profits, but most of their costs are outside their control (platform fees like the Apple store, developers, infrastructure for trust/safety for minors).

**Catalyst:** DeepSeek, a Chinese AI start-up, has temporarily suspended its API service top-ups due to server resource constraints. Additionally, U.S. lawmakers plan to introduce a bill to ban DeepSeek's chatbot application from government-owned devices over data security concerns.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The AI industry is under increased scrutiny regarding data security and geopolitical tensions but that's grown more laissez-faire under Trump. DeepSeek's service suspension and potential U.S. government ban helps American chip makers and NVDA especially, due to their continued dominance.

**Risks:** Deepseek getting banned will likely lead to greater reliance on American AI chatbots, spurring growth in American semis manufacturers.

**Catalyst:** EPS of $1.60 vs. $1.57 expected. Revenue of $1.07B vs 1.07B expected. Reports $2B stock buyback plan.

**Technicals:** Watching the $60 level, we've had a brutal fall from $90-&gt;$60. If we get closer I'm interested in some small bounce depending on volume/size of the move.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** SWKS supplies some of the chips for Apple's iPhone, and their iPhone sales haven't done too well recently- thus this has a knock-on effect by affecting SWKS's sales.

**Risks:** SWKS projected a revenue decline for the mobile segment and issued a lower profit forecast. They stated they anticipated a ""mid-to-high teens decline in mobile.""

409,NVDA,"Need advice on how to be more pragmatic with my stock buy/sell for year 2025. NVDA, MSTR, GOOGL recent picks were not fruitful at all.","The issue is, I am super mad at my recent stock picks. I either made a loss or net gain is zero. 

What I need to understand is what is the strategy that is popular to pick stocks or either before breakout?

What I recently realized is I am doing all wrong with 'stock picking' Website like, Yahoo Finance show 'live' data and it is stupid to buy stock based on their current trading value. The decision to buy/sell a stock based on current number makes no sense. 

My reason why I am typing this up is due to the following reasons:

1.  Bought NVDA at 120, 134 and 141 and sold at 145, only a portion of my total holding. Only few days ago, I saw it at 114 and decided to liquidate all my holding at the price.    With anticipation the stock will further crash. I was so wrong. In the end, I made no money off my trade (I probably lost since I will owe capital gain tax)

2. On my HSA, I bought MSTR for $340 or $450. I sold those at a loss and lost $1500

3. Bought GOOGL before the earning at $205. And we all know how that panned out, 8% negative. Today, I was so close to selling it and take in the loss, but I said 'no'. I need to understand what the F I am doing wrong.

  
Now, when I zoom back into my portfolio, the money maker for me has been either buying an ETF and kinda set and forget (not all ETF, FXAIX has been great) or bought tech stocks before they sky rocket. For example, Meta stock. I do have NVDA holding but they are from long time ago.

  
In conclusion, with all this and me sharing my recent trade, my question is, what is the programmatic way to pick and buy a stock. Because frankly, keeping up to date with recent price on Yahoo Finance, I think it is pretty useless. IMO, I see the current price to reflect what has already happened. It does not indicate WHAT will happen or where the stocks are heading.

In terms of 'RSI', MACD line, etc. I did explore it to kinda predict NVDA stock, but it was all a bust. I don't know if it is worth pursing it big time.

**Ticker:** [**AMD (Advanced Micro Devices)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMD&amp;p=d)

**Catalyst:** AMD reported EPS of $0.29 vs. $0.41 expected. Revenue of $7.66 billion vs. $7.5 billion expected. Ultimately said that data center segment revw will be down in Q1, but had clear positive outlook in 2025 and expected double digit revenue growth. This was what caused the stock to fall despite the initial spike.

**Technicals:** Watching $100 level, but doesn't seem to be an irrational move in my opinion.

**Risks:** The vast majority of NVDA/AMD's money comes from selling to businesses- individual consumers are a tiny slice of the pie despite gaming/client businesses growing. We also have threats from NVDA dominance, possible regulations from the US, etc.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Market had a pretty negative reaction to the news that they'd be investing far more in capex and missed on cloud revenue (was roughly $9B vs $12B expected).

**Risks:** Elevated capital spending may pressure Alphabet's margins if these investments do not yield the anticipated returns, especially amidst increasing competition in the AI and cloud markets. I don't really see the China investigation to affect their stock price much.

**Technicals:** I'm mainly interested in PDD because they own Temu, which focuses on shipping small/low-cost goods to the US and using the loophole for very low shipping costs.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The recent suspension by USPS may lead to increased demand for private carriers like UPS and FedEx to handle parcels from China. There are a number of Chinese companies that focus on shipping low cost goods (like PDD).

**Risks:** Heightened tariffs and trade barriers could disrupt supply chains, increase costs, and lead to potential overreliance on private carriers, which may face capacity constraints and regulatory scrutiny.

**Technicals:** Watching $60, no bias.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Despite Uber's strong quarterly performance, the company's cautious outlook, citing a potential $1 billion impact from a strong U.S. dollar on future bookings which results in worse earnings overseas.

**Risks:** Outside of self-driving cars (Uber partnered with Waymo to operate in Austin), currency fluctuations and international markets affect companies you wouldn't normally expect. This may move in future from tariff news.

**Technicals:** USO didn't move much on this piece of news, but if Trump actually makes this a policy then we might see a LOT more volatility in the future depending on how serious we get and if we get involved again.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The oil sector is sensitive to geopolitical developments in the Middle East, a region critical to global oil supply. Initial market reactions to Trump's Gaza proposal didn't impact oil prices. Not really a catalyst TODAY but worth thinking about in the future.

**Risks:** Potential escalation of regional tensions could disrupt oil production or transportation, leading to supply constraints and increased volatility in oil prices.
