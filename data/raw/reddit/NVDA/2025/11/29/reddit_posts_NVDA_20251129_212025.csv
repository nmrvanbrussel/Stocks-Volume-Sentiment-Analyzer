CyrusOne’s cooling system said “nope,” and CME hit the kill switch.  
No S&amp;P futures, no crude, no bonds… nothing.  
Just silence.  


Look, I’m not saying AI is to blame…

  
…but data centers have been running hotter than my margin calls ever since everyone started training 900 billion–parameter models to recommend cat memes.

**We’ve officially reached the point where AI is physically melting the financial system.**

At this rate, Nvidia will cause the next recession just by turning on another cluster. Yes, N V D A !!! 

Anyway, futures are frozen, the markets are cooked, and ... and ... and ...

Enjoy the chaos, degen'. LOL

8,NVDA,What the hell is going on with NVDA?,"Nvidia just reported one of the strongest earnings in the entire market. Revenue exploding, guidance raised, demand still ridiculous. Everything about the report screamed strength. Any other company would’ve gone straight up on numbers like that.

Instead, NVDA gets dumped.

And out of nowhere the news cycle flips. Suddenly every headline is about Google’s TPUs, Meta “considering alternatives,” AI spending fears, bubble warnings, all dropping at the exact same time. It feels like the entire narrative suddenly shifted away from Nvidia’s actual results toward boosting Google’s storyline.

The confusing part is that Google’s TPU ecosystem isn’t even close to replacing Nvidia at scale today. Not even remotely. But the fear was enough to push NVDA down like it’s some tiny speculative stock.

This is the company powering the entire AI boom. This is the hardware that every major AI model is running on. And somehow the market decides now is the moment to punish it?

It makes no sense.

Yet the selloff is happening, and because Nvidia is one of the heaviest weights in QQQ, SPY, and the whole semiconductor sector, the drop is pulling the entire market down with it. If this keeps going, it’s the kind of move that can trigger a chain reaction across the indices. Everything follows NVDA right now.

The timing of all this is what feels weird. Google pushes TPU hype, the media instantly amplifies it, NVDA tanks, Google rallies, and suddenly the entire market trades like something catastrophic happened, even though fundamentally nothing changed in the last 24 hours.

It doesn’t look like normal price action. It looks like someone flipped the sentiment switch.

Nvidia didn’t lose half a trillion in real value. It lost confidence because the story was yanked away from its earnings and redirected somewhere else.

The big question is whether this spiral continues and drags the whole market down with it, or whether NVDA stabilizes once people realize the fundamentals didn’t suddenly collapse.

Curious what others think. Is this legit fear, or are we getting pushed into a coordinated panic cycle?",1162,665,1764030516.0,2025-11-25T00:28:36+00:00,t3_1p5y5i7
9,NVDA,Google says AI demand forcing 2x capacity growth every 6 months as it targets 1000x scale in 5 years,"No paywall: [https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/11/google-tells-employees-it-must-double-capacity-every-6-months-to-meet-ai-demand/](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/11/google-tells-employees-it-must-double-capacity-every-6-months-to-meet-ai-demand/)

&gt;While AI bubble talk fills the air these days, with fears of overinvestment that could pop at any time, something of a contradiction is brewing on the ground: Companies like Google and OpenAI can barely build infrastructure fast enough to fill their AI needs.

&gt;During an all-hands meeting earlier this month, Google’s AI infrastructure head Amin Vahdat told employees that the company must double its serving capacity every six months to meet demand for artificial intelligence services, reports CNBC. The comments show a rare look at what Google executives are telling its own employees internally. Vahdat, a vice president at Google Cloud, presented slides to its employees showing the company needs to scale “the next 1000x in 4-5 years.”

&gt;While a thousandfold increase in compute capacity sounds ambitious by itself, Vahdat noted some key constraints: Google needs to be able to deliver this increase in capability, compute, and storage networking “for essentially the same cost and increasingly, the same power, the same energy level,” he told employees during the meeting. “It won’t be easy but through collaboration and co-design, we’re going to get there.”

&gt;It’s unclear how much of this “demand” Google mentioned represents organic user interest in AI capabilities versus the company integrating AI features into existing services like Search, Gmail, and Workspace. But whether users are using the features voluntarily or not, Google isn’t the only tech company struggling to keep up with a growing user base of customers using AI services.

&gt;Major tech companies are in a race to build out data centers. Google competitor OpenAI is planning to build six massive data centers across the US through its Stargate partnership project with SoftBank and Oracle, committing over $400 billion in the next three years to reach nearly 7 gigawatts of capacity. The company faces similar constraints serving its 800 million weekly ChatGPT users, with even paid subscribers regularly hitting usage limits for features like video synthesis and simulated reasoning models.

&gt;“The competition in AI infrastructure is the most critical and also the most expensive part of the AI race,” Vahdat said at the meeting, according to CNBC’s viewing of the presentation. The infrastructure executive explained that Google’s challenge goes beyond simply outspending competitors. “We’re going to spend a lot,” he said, but noted the real objective is building infrastructure that is “more reliable, more performant and more scalable than what’s available anywhere else.”

&gt;The thousandfold scaling challenge

&gt;One major bottleneck for meeting AI demand has been Nvidia’s lack of capacity to produce enough GPUs that accelerate AI computations. Just a few days ago during a quarterly earnings report, Nvidia said its AI chips are “sold out” as it races to meet demand that grew its data center revenue by $10 billion in a single quarter.

&gt;The lack of chips and other infrastructure constraints affects Google’s ability to deploy new AI features. During the all-hands meeting on November 6, Google CEO Sundar Pichai cited the example of Veo, Google’s video generation tool that received an upgrade last month. “When Veo launched, how exciting it was,” Pichai said. “If we could’ve given it to more people in the Gemini app, I think we would have gotten more users but we just couldn’t because we are at a compute constraint.”

&gt;At the same meeting, Vahdat’s presentation outlined how Google plans to achieve its massive scaling targets without simply throwing money at the problem. The company plans to rely on three main strategies: building physical infrastructure, developing more efficient AI models, and designing custom silicon chips.

&gt;Using its own chips means Google does not need to completely rely on Nvidia hardware to build out its AI capabilities. Earlier this month, for example, Google announced the general availability of its seventh-generation Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) called Ironwood. Google claims it is “nearly 30x more power efficient” than its first Cloud TPU from 2018.

&gt;Given widespread acknowledgment of a potential AI industry bubble, including extended remarks by Pichai in a recent BBC interview, the aggressive plans for AI data center expansion reflect Google’s calculation that the risk of underinvesting exceeds the risk of overcapacity. But it’s a bet that could prove costly if demand doesn’t continue to increase as expected.

&gt;At the all-hands meeting, Pichai told employees that 2026 will be “intense,” citing both AI competition and pressure to meet cloud and compute demand. Pichai directly addressed employee concerns about a potential AI bubble, acknowledging the topic has been “definitely in the zeitgeist.”",2876,610,1763847802.0,2025-11-22T21:43:22+00:00,t3_1p4532c
10,NVDA,"Wanted to write a DD, but now it's public: Intel to Secure Microsoft, Tesla, Qualcomm &amp; NVIDIA as Advanced Packaging Customers in the U.S.","One of the things that I wanted to mention in ""my last DD"" on INTC was that they have advanced 3D packaging technology, meaning they can put together different nodes into one chip - giving them an edge when it comes to combining ""the best of the best"". And how Lip-Bu Tan will use it to push INTC foundry business further

It looks like it's now going to become a reality.

I ofc. loaded up on more INTC Leaps during this bearish market, hope you fellas did too.

I might mention one more thing here a wild speculation:

Lip-Bu Tan is on the board of a company called ""AnnapurnaLabs"" an Israeli startup building AI chips, acquired by Amazon. Trainiums and Gravitons are ARM based chips produced by this company and there was a deal (closed by Pat Gelsinger in late 2024) that we didn't hear about for a long time. Amazon did mention something about upgrading their current lineup the same time more rumors about AI clients surfaced in mid 2025.

Could be pure wild speculation, but maybe they've decided to take advantage of the **improved voltage droop from 18A tech**, since they keep mentioning how the new lineup is more power efficient. Voltage droop is especially important for inference chips, fingers crossed.

Other than that we might see Maia II in '26 which is currently speculated to be produced fully with 18A tech.

To those people who kept asking about yield of the new fabs - it's improving by 7% each month.

I'm looking at some nice greens during this otherwise bearish market.

Lastly to the people still doubting Intel's power. Keep in mind that AMD has gained nothing from the data center market. Looking at their numbers they at best sold 1.5BLN worth of CPUs (they on purpose don't distinguish between GPU and CPU data center sales, however given the fact that it's 2:1 in price it's safe to say CPU is close to 1.5BLN) - compared to INTC 4.5BLN datacenter CPU sales.

Demand for AMD GPU/CPUs is low, Amazon itself reported this some time ago:  
[https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amazon-amzn-says-it-not-seeing-enough-demand-amds-ai-chips](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amazon-amzn-says-it-not-seeing-enough-demand-amds-ai-chips)

AMD CPUs are only sold with AMD GPUs, that's how they get their CPU sales. Datacenters always prefered Intel over AMD due to superior software and hardware support, the new Amazon 1GW Datacenter is a prime example of that.

AMD GPUs are not in demand, because unlike NVDA - no academic mind knows how to use it properly, the software support is shit and NVDA spent close to 20 years spoon feeding academics with CUDA. They are only competing with other inference chips:  
\- AMZN - Trainium  
\- GOOG - TPU  
\- MSFT - Maia II  
\- Honorable mentions: Qualcomm, INTC, etc.

The only demand for AMD GPUs is from a deal with OpenAI that is entirely dependent on AMD stock price being in the highs. Those who know me, know that I bought AMD puts and keep on buying them until AMD is trading at 160.

Entire blockchain DEFI ecosystem is built on TEEs from Intel (usually SGX, but are switching to TDX). AMD is not trusted in the cybersecurity domain and probably never will be. Intel is always going to dominate. So any banking / DEFI system built in cloud using TEEs is built with Intel.

There's a lot more that I could mention, but no point in doing so. People who understand the semiconductor industry will see that INTC is here to shine and thrive.

Lastly according to the CFO the foundry business is expected to be breakeven by 2027, however given Lip-Bu Tan's philosophy on ""underpromise, overdeliver"" I wouldn't be surprised if they were breakeven sooner.

**Note: IBKR is down for maintenance but once it's back up I will post my updated position. From the top of my head I have INTC 40C 55C 60C (and maybe I bought 50C) leaps as well as my old shares (800) that I bought around March-April**",383,83,1763832897.0,2025-11-22T17:34:57+00:00,t3_1p3z3la
11,NVDA,Eli Lilly becomes the first pharma to hit a 1 trillion dollar market cap on booming weight loss drug demand. LLY is +30% over the past month,"No paywall: [https://www.investors.com/news/technology/eli-lilly-trillion-dollar-club-tech-companies/](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/eli-lilly-trillion-dollar-club-tech-companies/)

&gt;Eli Lilly (LLY) became the first health care company to top $1 trillion in market capitalization on Friday, joining an exclusive club that includes big tech names like Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL) and [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com) (AMZN).

&gt;Shares rose as high at 1,061.17 in early action, tipping Lilly's market cap just north of $1 trillion for the first time. Eli Lilly stock closed 2% higher at 1,059.70, keeping its market cap in the 13-digit club.

&gt;According to CNBC, Lilly is the second non-tech name to reach the $1 trillion club in the U.S., following Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB).

&gt;Eli Lilly Stock's Comeback

&gt;Eli Lilly shares are making an impressive comeback, rising 35% this year after the drugmaker inked a deal with the Trump administration to sell its weight-loss drug, Zepbound, for a lower price on the new direct-to-consumer website, TrumpRx. The deal also includes a provision for Eli Lilly to sell Zepbound and Mounjaro, its diabetes powerhouse, to Medicare at a significant discount.

&gt;Rather than hurt Lilly's top line, experts say the move will expand the market, adding new patients who couldn't otherwise afford the popular drugs.

&gt;""The market penetration of these drugs in weight loss is still fairly low, and in diabetes, where it's higher, it's still low,"" Brad Stewart, an executive with the advisory firm BDO, recently told Investor's Business Daily. ""There's still a tremendous opportunity from growth just purely from additional patients.""

&gt;Lilly Shares Hit A Record High

&gt;Lilly stock has a perfect IBD Digital Composite Rating of 99. The 1-99 score pits a stock's fundamental and technical measures against all other stocks. On this measure, Eli Lilly stock outranks 99% of stocks, regardless of industry group.

&gt;Shares broke out of a lengthy consolidation with a buy point at 972.53. That entry represents the stock's previous record high, dating back to August 2024. Lilly stock has since blown well past that mark. The stock is now about 8% above its entry, north of the buy zone.

&gt;The strength is represented in Eli Lilly stock's 93 Relative Strength Rating, a measure of a stock's 12-month performance relative to all other stocks. Shares also have a nearly perfect EPS Rating of 98, meaning earnings growth is in the top 2% echelon of companies.",408,117,1763828682.0,2025-11-22T16:24:42+00:00,t3_1p3xc39

20,NVDA,Why the “bubble” narrative is missing the point – prices aren’t actually that extreme,"
Bulls keep winning and bears keep getting wrecked for one simple reason: most bears are fighting the last war. They’re staring at 1999-style trailing P/E charts or pre-1990s valuation norms and declaring “this time is different” as if that’s automatically a bad thing. In reality, this time really is different – and the data backs it up.
Look at the Magnificent 7 specifically:
	•	Forward P/E ratios are surprisingly moderate given the growth rates we’re seeing
	•	PEG ratios (P/E divided by expected growth) are actually lower than they’ve been at many points in the past decade and significantly lower than the rest of the S&amp;P 493
We’re not paying 1999 multiples for 1999 growth – we’re paying reasonable (or even cheap) multiples for a completely different quality of business.
The core reason we’ll never return to pre-1990s valuation levels: the economy has shifted from tangible to intangible assets. Intellectual property, network effects, proprietary datasets, and software moats compound in ways steel mills and railroads never could. These assets get better and cheaper to scale every year instead of depreciating.
On AI specifically – the bear case that “AI won’t monetize” misses the bigger picture. Direct AI revenue might concentrate in a handful of players (Nvidia, the cloud hyperscalers, etc.), but the second-order effect is massive OPEX compression across every industry. Translation: companies will need far fewer employees to generate the same (or more) revenue.
You might lose your job… but the companies you own will be dramatically more profitable because of it. “You’ll own nothing, be replaced by a model, and be happy.”
Bears who keep waiting for a return to 15× earnings are going to be waiting a very long time. The game changed permanently sometime around the mid-90s and the laggards still haven’t adjusted their mental models.

32,NVDA,PALANTIR - Is Alex Karp a GENIUS ?... or a PPC ?,"https://preview.redd.it/18vhv848f21g1.jpg?width=2610&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8af453e151f9abe27a0b5ff02db632e128dad08b

Alex Karp, in today's interview with [**Yahoo Finance**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6LakOrqDL4) demonstrated to be either a very convincing genius... or a Pathetically Pedantic Charlatan (PPC).

He was asked just a handful of of softball questions, none of which he answered in a coherent manner. He constantly derailed himself halfway through his responses by saying ""by the way"" and going completely off topic.

His body language was quite telling, as he kept touching his nose (a known sign of discomfort, nervousness or deception) and gesturing towards the interviewer, suggesting the questions should actually be different.

[The bolder the statement, the more he had to rub his nose...](https://preview.redd.it/0rd0ik4q091g1.jpg?width=2434&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1bca5b4f0122a2bd7c7a5b92bbb319c64ebfd5dc)

I find it interesting that for a person that hasn't served in the military, he openly brags about an institution he's never been a part of. Why does he need to sell the US military, as if he were a loudmouth general/admiral instead of just focusing on his organization?

Perhaps the most surprising argument was stating that ""[America is the only country in the world that provides everything from chips to anthology, above and below](https://youtu.be/-6LakOrqDL4?t=268)"".

Karp seems to be unaware that we rely on ASML equipment (Europe/Dutch) used by TSMC (Asia/Taiwan) to develop our AI hardware.

He not only talks like a cocky admiral, but also pretends to be Jensen Huang.

But make no mistake... Jensen and this clown have nothing in common.

Nvidia is over 10x larger than Palantir... and they actually generate incredible profits, with a reasonable valuation.

Jensen is the King of AI, not this clown.

.....and just last week, Jensen said ""[**China will win the AI race**](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/06/jensen-huang-says-china-will-win-the-ai-race-before-clarifying-in-a-statement-nvidia-trump-xi.html)"".

So on one side, you have an engineer, who is the most successful self made entrepreneur in human history... that **fully understands** parallel compute processing capabilities driving today's AI revolution... and on the other, a clown that studied philosophy and sociology in Germany, to partner with a German idiot who's constantly talking about the [**antichrist**](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/AWJkDol33SA)**.**

Hasn't anyone noticed that his hairstyle is a late version of Sam Bankman Fried's?

And just like SBF, he has a BS altruistic argument, pretending to work for everyday average Americans ""*welders, plumbers and truck drivers*"", which he mentioned twice during the interview (an obvious talking point)... But yeah, sure! Go get another PhD. in Deutschland, bitte!

I only wonder when South Park is adding Alex Karp to their cast.",350,260,1763057804.0,2025-11-13T18:16:44+00:00,t3_1ow8iq1

&gt;Nebius Group has signed a deal worth about $3 billion with Meta to provide the Facebook owner with AI infrastructure over ​a five-year period, the company said on Tuesday, after it ‌reported a more than fourfold rise in third-quarter revenue.

&gt;The company's shares seesawed in volatile premarket trading,‌ after it posted a surge in capital spending and a quarterly loss of over $100 million, widening from $39.7 million last year.

&gt;The stock has been on a strong run this year, with its market value rising fourfold to $27.61 billion, through ⁠last close.

&gt;The agreement with Meta ‌underscores the surging demand for high-performance computing power that is required to build and run artificial intelligence models.

&gt;It is Nebius' second contract ‍with a hyperscaler, following its $17.4 billion deal with Microsoft in September.

&gt;Nebius said it would deploy the capacity needed for the Meta contract over the next three months, adding that ​the demand was so strong that the size of the contract had to be ‌limited to the capacity that Nebius had available.

&gt;Amsterdam-based Nebius is among a group of so-called neocloud companies that offer hardware and cloud capacity as services. Its core business involves providing Nvidia graphics processing units and AI cloud, helping companies expand their AI infrastructure.

&gt;Nebius and its larger rival CoreWeave have seen strong demand this year as insatiable ⁠AI appetite has left even the biggest cloud companies,​ such as Microsoft and Amazon, with capacity ​constraints.

&gt;Nebius reported a 355% jump in revenue to $146.1 million in the third quarter ended September.

&gt;The company is targeting $7 billion to ‍$9 billion in annualized ⁠run-rate revenue by the end of 2026, compared with its ARR of about $551 million at September-end.

&gt;Its capital expenditures ballooned to $955.5 ⁠million in the September quarter, from $172.1 million a year earlier, as the company invests ‌heavily in securing GPUs, land and power.",937,123,1762864731.0,2025-11-11T12:38:51+00:00,t3_1ou8d1e

&gt;Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported slowing growth in monthly revenue, highlighting uncertainty over the sustainability of the AI boom even as industry behemoths including Nvidia Corp. chase more chip supplies.

&gt;The company posted a 16.9% rise in sales for October, the slowest pace since February 2024. Analysts on average are expecting sales to increase 16% in the current quarter. TSMC’s American depository receipts were up as much as 3% in pre-market trading.

&gt;Industry executives remain buoyant about AI-driven growth as major tech firms are accelerating investments in data centers. The TSMC revenue gain also just covers just a single month of business, offering investors less insight.

&gt;Investors were jolted last week by a sudden slump in Asia’s technology shares, which served as a stark reminder that the world-beating rally in artificial intelligence and semiconductor stocks may be nearing a short-term crest. Wall Street chief executives have warned of an overdue market correction, with Michael Burry’s Scion Asset Management also disclosing bearish wagers on Nvidia.

&gt;That’s despite massive ample spending plans from leading AI players.

&gt;Meta Platforms Inc., Alphabet Inc., [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com) Inc. and Microsoft Corp. will collectively spend more than $400 billion to fund an AI buildout next year, a 21% hike from 2025, to secure leadership in the race in emerging technologies.

&gt;Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang of Nvidia, which is the primary AI chip supplier to major companies, said on Saturday his business is “growing month by month, stronger and stronger.”

&gt;Huang met TSMC Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei and asked for more chip supplies during his two-day whirlwind trip to Taiwan this time when major chip designers are all chasing limited supplies from the Hsinchu-based company.

&gt;TSMC is also the go-to chipmaker for the Santa Clara, California-based firm’s competitors including Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Qualcomm Inc., and it makes Apple Inc.’s silicon for iPhones and other gadgets.

&gt;Huang’s optimism is shared by his rivals. Qualcomm Chief Executive Officer Cristiano Amon told Bloomberg TV last week that the world is underestimating how big AI will get.

&gt;In October, Wei told analysts that TSMC’s capacity was still very tight and the company is working hard to narrow the gap between demand and supplies.

43,NVDA,Why Super Micro computer is the obvious play,"Super Micro Computer (SMCI) remains a high-conviction play in the AI infrastructure space, leveraging its rack-scale server expertise and tight Nvidia partnerships to capture explosive demand. Despite a post-earnings dip to ~$42 (down ~10% on Nov 5), the stock trades at an undemanding valuation, setting up asymmetric upside as deferred revenues unlock in Q2. With a massive &gt;$14B order backlog and expanding manufacturing capacity, SMCI is positioned for multi-year growth in the AI data center buildout—think hyperscalers upgrading to Blackwell GPUs at scale.

Q1 FY26 Results &amp; Updated Q2 Guidance: Q1 revenue came in at $5.02B (miss vs. $6.09B est., -18% QoQ), with EPS at $0.35 (vs. $0.41 est.), pressured by ~$1.8B in deferred rack shipments tied to customer validations and supply chain timing. Margins held steady at ~14.5%, reflecting cost controls amid volume ramps. However, the real story is the new Q2 guidance, upgraded in the earnings call to reflect full deferred recognition: official range of $5.9B–$6.2B, but management explicitly signaled “double-digit potential” (10B+), driven by Q1 deferrals + accelerated Blackwell system deployments. Analysts (e.g., Rosenblatt, Barclays) model $9–11B for Q2—a ~100% QoQ surge—aligning with FY26 full-year outlook now raised to ≥$36B. This isn’t organic weakness; it’s a classic timing shift, with no lost orders.

Current Valuation: At $42, SMCI trades at a rock-bottom ~0.7x FY26 P/S (on $36B rev guidance), vs. peers like Dell (1.2x) and HPE (1.0x)—and that’s before baking in the Q2 upside to 40–44B annualized run-rate. Forward P/E ~15x on expected $2.80+ EPS, with ROIC accelerating on AI margins. The dip embeds bearish fears of volatility, but ignores the backlog’s strength and capex tailwinds (Malaysia/USA factories at full tilt).

Historical Pattern &amp; Catalysts: SMCI’s playbook is consistent: Q1/Q2 “misses” on deferrals (3/3 since 2024), followed by Q3/Q4 beats (avg. +10% vs. est., +50–180% stock gains over 3–12 months). Q2 here mirrors Q1’24’s setup but with 2x the backlog and Nvidia’s GPU guarantees. Key catalysts: Blackwell validation completions (Dec), hyperscaler wins (5+ in queue), and no major bottlenecks.

47,NVDA,Why the bubble narrative is a generational GOOG buying opportunity,"Have gotten 20+ messages asking me if / when I plan to sell my GOOG LEAP position. So sharing my thoughts here:

You basically can’t go 20 seconds without hearing someone mention the tech / AI bubble these days. It’s completely unavoidable and is shaping how people invest more than you may realize. But here’s why I think this narrative is actually creating a generational buying opportunity for a few companies.

People are conflating the AI bubble and the massive growth of the Mag 6. But fail to acknowledge that, barring Nvidia, the Mag 6 growth is almost 100% due to non-LLM based bottom line growth. These monopolies are putting up Jokic numbers that justify these valuations.

This brings us to Google, one of the most oversold stocks in the entire market (until very recently). After reporting a record breaking 100M revenue quarter, and beating EPS expectations by over 30%, GOOG stayed completely flat. Touted as part of the “frothy and way overbought” Mag 7, GOOG’s PE ratio of 27.91 is LOWER THAN SPY’s PE of 28.89.

Let me repeat that for you:

One of the three companies that can manufacture cutting edge AI chips at scale, the HIGHEST NET PROFIT COMPANY ON THE PLANET, that grew every part of its business double digits YoY, has a lower PE ratio than:

-Walmart
-Caterpillar
-Costco
-Nike
-Hilton
-Pepsi


Talk about overvaluation. I’d argue the rest of SPY is more bubbly, as they are being bought via Index funds en masse due to MAG 7 gains, but aren’t being shorted like the MAG 7 are because that doesn’t fit the narrative.


The way I see it, even if we are in a bubble, google does not depend on AI contracts dated 1-4 years out in the way that other players in the space do, as they consume the lions share of their own compute with their money printing businesses.


And if we aren’t in a bubble, and those who control AI control the world, then google is probably the best positioned company out there. They have the strongest AI talent, have several already vetted AI business (Isomorphic labs, Waymo, Search, Shorts), own the entire AI stack: applications, models, chips, data centers (they have 10+ yoe building massive TPU data-centers on time).


The absurd undervaluation compared to its peers (AMZN, MSFT, AAPL, NVDA) won’t last forever. Given google is the most profitable business in the world, either the rest of the Mag 6 need to show growth rates significantly higher than google’s absurd pace to justify the 30-40% premium, or GOOG will need to show signs of slowing down. But that’s not what we’re seeing today, and I’m tired of pretending that GOOGL is at all “overvalued” due to the AI bubble.  it’s arguably the other way around.

**1. Introduction : The Exploding Demand for Optical Bandwidth**

As AI clusters and cloud infrastructure demand more and more networking bandwidth, electronic links in the datacenter are being confined to shorter and shorter distances.

Yet as these datacenters promise to consume exponentially more power to satisfy this massive bandwidth, operators are disaggregating them into disparate physical sites up to hundreds of miles apart in order to reliably deliver them the giga-Watts of power they require and adequately cool them.

Networking infrastructure both within and between datacenters is being increasingly built with photonic links.

For the same reasons -- power, latency and reliability being paramount -- operators are giving renewed attention to optics for datacenter switching in a slow but growing move away from traditional electrical packet switching.

I believe Lumentum ($LITE) is the optical product maker best-positioned to capitalize on these near- and far-term transformations.

**2. The Company : Cloud Revenue Inflecting Upward, Massive Purchase from NVIDIA**

Lumentum earns roughly 90% of its \~$500MM quarterly revenue from its optical transceivers and lasers chips for cloud and networking applications. It earns the remaining 10% from industrial and consumer segments, neither of which are covered here.

Its primary moneymakers are transceivers capable of up to 800G transmission and lasers capable of up to 200G modulation. Its EM Lasers are used as the light source for optical datacenter interconnect (DCI) and its narrow linewidth lasers light up 400ZR and 800ZR coherent optical links capable of 100km transmission. Operators like Meta, Microsoft, and AWS are deploying these 400ZR, 800ZR and eventually 1600ZR coherent links in massive quantities to connect up their datacenters and AI factories. These fiber links are lit by narrow-linewidth lasers, of which Lumentum's are considered best-in-class due to the higher yields on them they realize compared to competitors' lasers, per management commentary. This capability gives the company favorable ""pricing latitude"" and ""price levers"" per the CEO that, per the CFO, would provide further upside to the company's already-improving margins.

Lumentum's experience in developing high-power lasers for subsea fiber links gave them the foundation for development of the ultra-high-power lasers that NVIDIA has turned to for its 200G photonic-enabled switches with co-packaged optics (CPO). This commitment from NVIDIA, announced last quarter, is Lumentum's largest-ever purchase order. This arrangement is just in its early innings.

Lumentum's cloud-facing revenue is inflecting upward and drove Q42025 revenue above even the company's revised guidance. Cloud revenue grew 16% QoQ and 67% YoY. Management cites ""exceptional"" demand from hyperscalers for both their transceiver modules and laser components. Their modules revenue grew 50% QoQ, and management expects their components business to have a breakout year in 2026.

The company has expanded its US manufacturing capacity in order to produce more of its components State-side and meet the heavy demand for its products.

**3. Giga-Chads and Giga-Watts : Distributed AI Factories and ""Scale-Across"" Infrastructure**

That giga-chad Mark Zuckerberg is building giga-Watt datacenters.

NVIDIA is building networking switches with integrated photonics that connect ""AI Factories"" to millions of GPUs across physical sites.

Microsoft is spending $80bn on its regional Azure datacenters.

The massive energy consumption of these networked elements necessitates that they be disaggregated into multiple physical sites, all of which are linked by high-speed optics. NVIDIA terms this the ""scale-across"" network, expanding on their ""scale-up"" and scale-out"" capabilities.

These \~100km links are built today with 400ZR/ZR+ coherent optical technology, which is ramping 30% YoY, while the industry is rapidly transitioning to 800ZR/ZR+ with 1600ZR/ZR+ on the horizon. Coherent optics require the high-power narrow-linewidth lasers that Lumentum specializes in: coherent module and DSP makers like Cisco, Ciena and Marvel are shipping as many of these as they can build. Lumentum signaled strong demand for these lasers in its 3Q24 report.

Lumentum's 100G and 200G EM Lasers are also in high demand. Providers are turning to 100G and increasingly 200G optics to satisfy the demands of their AI workloads in scale-out networks. Lumentum's 200G EM Lasers are on allocation and allow the company to take price as mentioned above.

**4. Co-Packaged Optics : Key Ecosystem Partner in NVIDIA's ""Scale-Out"" Networks**

Electrical interconnects within the datacenter are also being migrated to optical technologies.

Co-packaged optics (CPO) are the long-term answer to meeting AI networks' requirements for low latency, low power, high reliability and high faceplate density. Major switch makers like Broadcom, NVIDIA and Cisco are integrating optics right next to the switch silicon to simplify the connection to the optical fiber and eliminate the cost and power of the DSP that the switch otherwise has to connect to in a traditional external pluggable optical module. NVIDIA demonstrated that their switches with CPO photonics engines consume 67% less power than their pluggable switches.

CPO will eventually cannibalize the intra-DC pluggable module business.

CPO requires high-power lasers to light up the link's optical fiber. Last quarter, Lumentum reported their largest-ever PO, for their high-power lasers for a 200G CPO application. This is almost certainly for NVIDIA's CPO photonic switches. Lumentum appears for now to be the only vendor approved by them for these lasers: ""We believe we have a good competitive moat that will keep us in that position (of being sole-sourced)"".

I expect to hear of follow-on orders for CPO lasers in Lumentum's upcoming quarterly call: The company expects a ""significant revenue ramp in CPO by the second half of calendar 2026.""

Lumentum manufactures these lasers in a US fab, exempting them from any tariffs on this revenue, while also expanding capacity.

So, they are the vendor with the largest capacity to produce these lasers, of which theirs are the industry's best-performing, while being the sole supplier approved for NVIDIA's CPO switches.

A knock on CPO has been the perception of its inferior reliability compared to traditional pluggable modules. Meta dispelled this at the ECOC conference last month, stating, ""While CPO’s value in substantially reducing power over traditional re-timed transceivers has been well established, the integrated nature of CPO and its impact to the reliability, availability, and serviceability at scale has been elusive... Within this initial time period spanning over 15 million device hours, we have observed zero unserviceable failures as well as a 5x improvement in link reliability compared to traditional pluggable optical modules... As we continue to explore innovative solutions offering reliable and power-efficient optical connectivity for the AI networks, these CPO reliability results reinforce its viability to address the future optical I/O challenges of data center network infrastructure.""

CPO has been a technology long on the horizon of the optical networking industry, but its widespread adoption is imminent.

**5. Optical Circuit Switching (OCS) : An New and Expanding Market**

In the face of ballooning power DC and AI factory power consumption, hyperscalers and DC operators are showing renewed and increasing interest in OCS as an alternative, if not replacement, to electrical packet switching. OCS is not new, having had its moment in the sun in 1990s and early 2000s. Google was perhaps the first major DC operator to deploy it at scale in recent years, finding that it improved power by 40%, cost by 30% and uptime by 50x. OCS is particularly suited to AI applications because of its low latency and high reliability.

Last quarter, Lumentum reported the shipment of OCS evaluation units and more recently has announced additional OCS products, likely in response to customer interest. They have two hyperscalers signed onto their OCS platform with a third committed for 2026. Management said last quarter that OCS will bring ""very, very significant revenue in Q1, Q2 and then certainly in the back half of calendar 2026.""

So that's a second significant 2H2026 revenue inflection.

OCS is now a $100MM+ revenue source for the company with margins ""significantly"" above the corporate average and a time frame to significant revenue that is becoming ""sharply clear that it's sooner rather than later.""

**6. Taking Share from Competitor**

Coherent ($COHR) is Lumentum's primary US-based competitor vying to supply the networking industry with optical components (lasers, OCS, transceivers). We noted that Lumentum is sharply growing its cloud and datacom business. This appears to be coming at Coherent's expense, because even in this era of massive spending on network infrastructure and heavy demand for optical gear, they issued weaker-than-expected guidance last quarter. Their datacenter revenue growth continues to slow, to 24% from the prior quarters' 39%, 46% and 58%. Investors punished them severely for this miss, sending the stock down 20%.

Lumentum appears to be taking share: their datacom growth stands at 44% while Coherent's is only 4%. Lumentum as noted is presently the only laser vendor approved by NVIDIA for its CPO switches, while Coherent made no mention of any new POs or wins in the CPO space. Lumentum has the incumbent advantage here.

And in OCS, management states that they have been able ""to capture volume opportunities earlier than competitors.""

**7. Industry Consolidation : Component Makers Get Snapped Up**

The recent history of the optical networking industry shows numerous acquisitions. Barriers to entry have grown as bandwidths increase, dimensions shrink and semiconductor mask costs reach into the tens of millions. Smaller firms that develop key enabling technologies or components have been the ones to be snapped up.

Lumentum CEO Michael Hurlston has been through to this. He led Finisar when it was acquired by II-VI (now Coherent) in 2018.

On the flip side of the ledger, Lumentum acquired Neophotonics in 2021 to capture its expertise in building the narrow-linewidth lasers that have become a lynchpin of the coherent optics segment.

For motivations similar to those expressed in the quotes below, I believe Lumentum is on the short list of photonics suppliers that a larger system integrator, module maker or certain GPU networking giant would seek to acquire.

NVIDIA in particular could acquire Lumentum to secure its supply of lasers for its CPO switches, while also bringing in-house the engineering expertise needed to incorporate optical switching into its back-end AI network installations. Small OCS matrices like the 64x64 product Lumentum just announced would be well-suited to this application.

This of course is more speculative than my arguments of where Lumentum's near-term business is headed. Nonetheless it's a feasible outcome for the company and one I want exposure to.

* Nokia acquires Infinera for $2.3B, Feb. 2025: ""This transaction will significantly improve our scale and profitability in optical networks, and allows us to speed up the pace of innovation to meet the requirements of the AI era.""
* II-VI acquires Coherent for $6.6B, July 2022: ""Coherent is an innovator with a rich portfolio of some of the most advanced technologies in the world, which have been transformative in a broad range of markets.""
* Lumentum acquires Neophotonics for $900M, Nov. 2021: ""With NeoPhotonics, we're making another important investment in better serving our customers and expanding our photonics capabilities at a time when photonics are at the forefront of favorable long-term market trends.""
* Marvel acquires Inphi for $10B, Apr. 2021: ""Inphi’s technologies are at the heart of cloud data center networks and they continue to extend their leadership with innovative new products, including 400G data center interconnect optical modules, which leverage their unique silicon photonics and DSP technologies.""
* Cisco acquires Acacia for $4.5B, July 2019: ""With the explosion of bandwidth in the multi-cloud era, optical interconnect technologies are becoming increasingly strategic. The acquisition of Acacia will allow us to build on the strength of our switching, routing and optical networking portfolio to address our customers' most demanding requirements.""
* Cisco acquires Luxtera for $660M, Feb. 2019: ""Coupled with our silicon and optics innovation, Luxtera will allow our customers to build the biggest, fastest and most efficient networks in the world.""
* II-VI acquires Finisar for $3.2B, Nov. 2018: ""Today our company is taking a giant leap forward in our scale to serve a significantly increasing addressable market.""

**8. Tariffs : Not a Threat**

Tariffs have not materially affected Lumentum's financial performance and management has stated that they do not anticipate them to. But with our mercurial president at the helm, the risk that tariffs will be levied on optics is ever-present.

**9. Short Interest : 15% SI, 5-Day D T C and 120% Institutional Ownership**

While lower than the crazy 100%+ SI values we've aped on here, I consider 15% SI to be substantial, especially for a company in as strong of a position as Lumentum's. The stock has risen 200% over the past six months, during which time SI has hovered between 15% and 18%, implying they're in a neutral-to-losing position. The stock is on at least one broker's hard-to-borrow list. Its 4.7-day D T C and 120% institutional ownership imply a tight float.

If Lumentum publishes a strong earning report on Nov. 4 as I expect they will, one could envision a rush to close these short positions. I have a hard time seeing the bear case here.

**10. Catalysts**

As mentioned, Lumentum reports 2026Q1 results Nov. 4 after market close. I expect a solid earnings beat and positive guidance around additional CPO-related orders, 200G EM L laser volumes and favorable pricing, and inflecting OCS revenue.

Hearing of continuing high infrastructure CapEx from Meta, Microsoft and Amazon when they each report this week should also be viewed as beneficial to the stock.

A rush to cover short positions in response to a beat would provide further upward momentum.

**11. Positions**

I own 2100 shares, worth $440k at today's $191 share price. I opened Nov. 7 230C for leverage to Lumentum's earnings release, and Nov. 21 250C for leverage to NVIDIA's (Nov. 19). I may also buy calls with a further expiration to remain exposed to the longer-term industry migrations detailed here.

56,NVDA,Nvidia call options made over $140k,"Quick update since my last NVDA post unexpectedly pulled in over a thousand upvotes  
I’ve been digging deeper into NVIDIA and the momentum plus the whole AI narrative hasn’t slowed down at all so I scaled up added different strikes and expirations to balance risk while still riding the wave

Right now I’m holding five different NVDA call positions and every single one of them is printing unrealized profits in the six figures and still climbing  
This thing has zero chill

I’m locking in profits little by little but still keeping most of the position running because NVIDIA doesn’t go up it launches

In April 2025, NVIDIA announced it would begin manufacturing AI chips in the U.S., partnering with Amkor for packaging and testing in Arizona. NVIDIA’s new “Blackwell” AI chips mark a key milestone in bringing high-performance chip production back to the U.S.

Amkor’s Q3 2025 earnings beat expectations, with revenue of $1.99 billion and EPS of $0.51, reflecting strong demand from AI and high-performance computing markets. Gross margin rose to 14.3 percent, and cash holdings increased to $2.1 billion after reducing debt by $400 million.

CEO Giel Rutten will retire at the end of 2025 as Amkor boosts capital spending to about $950 million, including construction of its $7 billion advanced packaging campus in Arizona. Guidance for Q4 2025 forecasts revenue between $1.67 and $1.77 billion and EPS of $0.20 to $0.30. Shares rose roughly 3 percent in after-hours trading to around $33.73.

67,NVDA,NBIS earnings DD (Ne🅱️ius),"TLDR/summary: NBIS is going to skyrocket after upcoming q3 earnings due to multiple upcoming bullish catalysts as well as ANOTHER upwards revision in ARR guidance for full year 2025.

Positions: 8k worth of call options  with most expiring 11/21. $100, $110, and $130 strikes are the main position. Will likely be adding into further OTM strikes as well, probably $140 and $150 when other funds settle.

If you check my post history you will see a previously written speculation post on q3 earnings. This post will include a lot of the same information, with some extra. But positions have been rearranged to reflect real earnings date of 11/11 instead of 10/31 like I had originally thought. I did take a 3k loss due to this mistake earlier (that’s ok I’m fucking stupid)

Company overview

Nebius Group N.V. (NASDAQ: NBIS) is a European AI-infrastructure company based in Amsterdam with R&amp;D hubs across Europe, Israel, and North America. Originally part of Yandex N.V., Nebius became its own pure-play “neo-cloud” infrastructure firm after spinning off all Russian assets in 2024.

Today, Nebius operates data center infrastructure and provides a full-stack AI cloud platform (“Nebius AI Cloud”) serving startups, research labs, and hyperscalers.

Nebius’s “platform as a service” (PaaS) adds another layer and acts as an alternative to the “infrastructure as a service”(IaaS) models that other Neo clouds use, such as IREN, CRWV, etc

Current CEO Arkady Volozh was co-founder of Yandex. Dig a little deeper into their spin off from Russia and you will understand how talented the Nebius crew is today. They have plenty of experience in large scale cloud and AI systems experience. The only difference now is that they are starting with a clean slate, and access to western markets.

Earnings preview

[Q2 earnings](https://assets.nebius.com/assets/a1ea2731-32b4-4b8d-82b4-0557fddadd1a/Nebius%20-%20Financial%20results%20-%20Q2%202025.pdf?cache-buster=2025-08-26T16:52:29.128Z) was incredibly bullish for nebius, with an 2025 ARR guidance being revised upwards from 750m-1b to 900m-1.1b. Not only that, but they saw a 625% increase in revenue YoY. Q2 earnings were released on August 7, 2025.

As you can see from q2 earnings, they were already poised for explosive growth.

[Then, they went and signed a $17.4billion contract with MSFT](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1513845/000110465925088312/tm2525580d1_6k.htm) on September 8, 1 month after their q2 earnings call.

The important thing to remember about the MSFT deal is that this is not instant revenue for NBIS. NBIS must have activated capacity to service the contract prior to receiving revenue from this.

It is extremely unlikely that Nebius’ $900M–$1.1B ARR guidance (which was already revised up from previous) from Q2 earnings included money from the Microsoft deal. That guidance came out in August, while the contract wasn’t announced until september. Companies generally don’t build unfinished or undisclosed deals into official numbers.

Along with that information, please check their 6k (linked above) - “Gpu services will be deployed in several tranches during 2025 and 2026”, meaning that at least part of the revenue from MSFT contract will be baked into 2025 figures. 

Rumor has it that the MSFT contract encompasses 300mW of activated capacity. Nebius guided for 220mW of build out by EOY’25 and 1GW by EOY ‘26. This again indicates that Nebius is ready to start collecting revenue from said contract this year. 

Given that average ARR over the life of the MSFT contract is a little less than 4b/year, if they even capture 1/4 of that in 2025 they will be effectively doubling their previously projected ARR for ‘25

Side note, a deal of this size with one of the biggest hyperscalers shows confidence in Nebius product and Nebius cloud. More companies will likely follow provided they execute MSFT deal well.

——————————————————————————
Other tech earnings 

MSFT, GOOG, AMZN, META will be reporting earnings this week. I expect a lot of chatter regarding increased AI capex spend as well as increased need for more compute from these companies. This will run Nebius price up until they report earnings.

——————————————————————————

NVDA GTC partnership speculation.

NVDA has equity stake in Nebius. Nebius will be speaking at GTC, right after an NVDA announcement for a [partnership](https://www.nvidia.com/gtc/dc/session-catalog/?search=DC51273&amp;tab.allsessions=1700692987788001F1cG#/ ) regarding AI agents and full stack software offerings (sound familiar?) the whole Nebius executive team will be there and will be the first ones to speak at 9:40am after this announcement.

Nebius also teasing that they will be announcing something at GTC and to stay tuned.

My stupid app won’t let me sell more than 600 contracts. Total sold contract: 2,400, price between 4.3-6.  
Maybe it moons more, maybe not. I’m too old for this rollercoaster- 900% average gain is enough degeneracy for one day.

edit 6 hours after posting (sharing strategy):

My logic was caveman simple: Intel, AMD, NVIDIA, and AVGO all already mooned off the AI hype train. Meanwhile, I’ve been bagholding QCOM spot for almost 2 years and that fkn price barely moved an inch.

At the beginning of this month, AMD went vertical, and after I witnessed that, I kept thinking, “All the big chip names printed off AI-when the hell does QCOM get its turn?” My smooth brain said, “Yeah, QCOM’s next.” No DD, no proof, just pure instinct and caffeine.

This week alone, they announced deeper AI alliances that could juice enterprise adoption. Imagine: UiPath bots pulling real-time data from Snowflake, reasoning with OpenAI, and deploying on NVIDIA hardware. That's not incremental; that's a moat.
* **Product Momentum**: Agentic platform's getting rave reviews—enterprises are piloting it for complex shit like supply chain orchestration. Motley Fool just dropped ""4 Major Trends Powering UiPath's Next Growth Phase,"" citing AI adoption, vertical expansions (healthcare, finance), and global push.
* **Market Tailwinds**: RPA market's $25B today, projected $65B by 2030 (CAGR 20%+). But agentic AI? That's the $100B+ unlock. UiPath's positioned as the ""Salesforce of automation."" Next earnings in December could be the spark—expect AI pipeline updates to light Twitter on fire.

Sentiment's flipping too. X chatter's buzzing with ""generational run"" calls and $20C options flow. One trader's eyeing the 200-week MA break for ""multiples."" Even with some promo noise, the vibe's bullish.

**Valuation: Undervalued AF Compared to AI Peers**

Analysts are sleeping—consensus PT's a meh $13.71 (Hold rating), high of $17. WTF? Morningstar bumped fair value to $13.71 recently, but that's pre-partnership news. At $8.8B market cap (post-rally), they're trading at 5.8x FY26 sales est. $1.42B. Peers? $SNOW at 12x, $DDOG at 15x, $PLTR at 25x (with less profitability).

My quick DCF (assuming 15% rev CAGR to $3B by 2030, 25% margins, 10% discount): $25+ PT. But conservatively, if ARR hits $2.5B by FY28 (20% CAGR, doable with AI), that's $20 easy on 8x sales. Upside from here? 21% to $20. If catalysts hit, 50%+ to $25.

**Quick Company Primer: RPA's OG Going Full AI Beast Mode**

UiPath ain't new to this—they're *new* to being this jacked. Founded in Romania in 2005, they basically invented robotic process automation (RPA). Think software bots that handle the soul-crushing shit like data entry, invoice processing, or compliance checks so humans don't have to. Went public in '21 at a frothy $56, peaked at $80, then cratered to $10 amid macro BS and AI FOMO.

But here's the glow-up: They're not just bots anymore. UiPath's pivoting hard into ""agentic AI""—smart agents that don't just automate tasks, they *orchestrate* entire workflows with reasoning, voice integration, and self-healing. Their Platform for Agentic Automation just got named one of TIME's Best Inventions of 2025. And at FUSION 2025 (their big conf in September), they dropped bombs like ScreenPlay (no-code AI scripting) and UiPath Labs for enterprise-scale agent building. This isn't hype; it's sticky enterprise software with 1,400+ customers (Fortune 500 heavyweights like NASA, Uber, Verizon) and a net retention rate north of 110%.

72,NVDA,Quantum Computing Inc $QUBT fraud,"**Reposted with positions. Mods removed it because it had no positions (I replied with my positions to a comment asking for them).**

My background: I'm a graduate student and researcher in quantum complexity theory. I'm not a hardware engineer, but I do follow developments in quantum hardware closely. Based on my analysis, I have serious concerns that QUBT’s claims may amount to fraud.

[Positions](https://i.imgur.com/cxvZaJa.jpeg). I fully believe that the stock of this [beverage-company-turned-quantum-computing](https://i.imgur.com/Ndz0r8p.png) should go to $0 (or close to it) and it is only a matter of time before it does.

I will split this post into a few parts. First, we will review their fundamentals. Then, we will look into their future claims. Finally, we will review any contracts and future prospects.

**1)** **Fundamentals.** The market cap of QUBT is $3.73 billion and for the three-month period ending June 30, 2025, QUBT reported revenues of $61,000 (yes, you read that right), a decrease from the $183,000 generated in the same quarter of the previous year. They do not have a P/E ratio, as they are unprofitable (you could think that their P/E ratio is high and negative). This means that they have an enterprise value of roughly $3.38 billion which comes almost entirely from their market cap and with a revenue of $263k, their EV/revenue ratio is 12.870. To put it into perspective how extreme that is: 


Company | Enterprise Value/Revenue
-------|------------------------
QUBT | 12870
IONQ | 419
GOOGL | 8
RDDT | 20

If you think RDDT is inflated, then QUBT is roughly 643 more inflated.
Equivalently, RDDT's price would be $137,602 with QUBT's ratio.
This isn't just a premium or hopeium, this is complete detachment from any financial logic or reality.

The company's operational model is a financial black hole. While generating almost no income, its operating expenses nearly doubled year-over-year to $10.2 million for the quarter, resulting in a $10.2 million operating loss. That means the company spent over $167 for every single dollar it made in revenue. The bottom line was a net loss of $36.5 million for the quarter.

QUBT's narrative is that it's a pioneer in one of the most capital-intensive R&amp;D races in human history. Yet, its R&amp;D investment totaled $6.0 million. To compare, [Google and IBM are forming partnerships to pour $150 million into university research alone](https://thequantuminsider.com/2023/05/19/ibm-and-google-join-forces-invest-150-million-in-quantum-computing-research-at-us-and-japanese-universities/), with their internal budgets estimated to be in the billions. How can QUBT possibly compete, let alone innovate, when its R&amp;D budget is a rounding error for its serious competitors?

**2)** **Their future plan.** [This is straight from their presentation.](https://i.imgur.com/p0L9RhX.png) For 2025, they claim ""Early revenues primarily from early adopters."" This is their present reality: microscopic revenues. For 2026-2027, they project ""High-margin revenue from first mover advantage"" and ""Strong pipeline conversion."" These are classic, undefined marketing terms. What constitutes ""high-margin""? 20%? 80%? How much revenue? A million dollars? A hundred million? The lack of any figures makes these claims meaningless. There is no way to measure their performance or hold them accountable. They have no viable plan to get an advantage.
In 2028, the goal is ""Sales Growth =&gt; Market Growth."" This is a generic corporate objective, not a financial forecast. It's a promise to perform well in an undefined future market.

They sell something they call the DIRAC-3, which is an analog quantum annealer. It is not a universal quantum computer capable of running a wide range of algorithms. Its sole function is to find approximate solutions in a a narrow category of optimization problems. In practice, its actual use is almost certainly confined to experimental and research settings. The buyers are not businesses looking to solve their core operational issues, but rather academic institutions or corporate R&amp;D labs that are exploring novel computing architectures. For these niche customers, the DIRAC-3 serves as a piece of laboratory equipment to test theories, publish papers, and perhaps make small claims in quantum-adjacent research. The almost non-existent revenue confirms that it is not being deployed for any meaningful commercial or production-level task.

The primary reason a research group might acquire a DIRAC-3 has little to do with solving a pressing business problem better than a classical computer. Its appeal lies in its novelty and convenience. The machine's use of ""qudits"" and its analog architecture makes it a fun object of academic study at the very best. In essence, someone would want the DIRAC-3 not because it provides a superior solution, but because it is a comparatively cheap tool for exploration and playing around, not a tool for production.

The future prospects for the DIRAC-3 appear exceptionally bleak. It is trapped in a brutally competitive field and it has failed to demonstrate a decisive advantage. To be commercially viable, it must solve a specific, high-value optimization problem significantly faster or cheaper than the highly-refined classical software that has been developed over decades. There is zero evidence that it can do this, and it will never be able to do so. Its potential market is being squeezed from both sides: classical optimization algorithms continue to improve, while the slow but steady progress of true universal quantum computers (i.e. by Google and IBM) threaten to make such intermediate devices obsolete. The DIRAC-3's most probable fate is to become a technological footnote. It is an interesting but ultimately unsuccessful architectural experiment that never found a problem it could solve well enough to justify its own existence in the commercial world.

They make some claims of what they ""will develop"":

First is the Photonic Intelligent Unit (PIU), or ""Reservoir Computer,"" which is being marketed as a revolutionary device for ""compute at the edge"" and Artificial Intelligence. This is straight up misleading and the reality is that reservoir computing is a highly obscure, academic niche even amongst researchers. It has zero commercial adoption. The AI market is not asking for this and it never will, not even in 20 years. AI is built around GPUs and specialized AI chips from NVIDIA, Google, and Apple. The notion that QUBT's niche device, based on a fringe computing model, could make even the smallest dent in this market is laughable. It is a solution in search of a problem, a research gadget being passed off as a commercial AI accelerator. Its only potential customers are a handful of academics, not the enterprises driving the AI revolution. I fully believe they only included the word ""AI"" as a buzzword to attract and scam more investors into their sham of a company.

Next is the Quantum Cyber Module (QCM), which promises ""unconditional security at chip scale"" and is supposedly destined for ""cell phones."" This is pure fantasy. At its core, this device is likely just a Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG), a piece of hardware that has been around for years. While useful for specific cryptographic applications, the market is small, and established competitors like ID Quantique have dominated it for over a decade. The claim of putting this technology into a cell phone is absurd. The cost, size, and marginal benefit over existing cryptographic algorithms make it a non-starter for any mass-market device. It is a commodity component being dressed up in a superhero costume of ""unconditional security"" to attract investors who are fearful of cyber threats but ignorant of the actual technology.

Finally, the company claims to have a ""Quantum Intelligent Sensing Module"" (QISM) focused on LiDAR applications, boasting ""unparalleled detection accuracy."" This is, perhaps, the most ridiculous claim of all (and they have made a lot of crazy claims!). Consider heavily-funded companies like Luminar and Velodyne fighting for razor-thin margins and massive automotive and defense contracts. These companies have invested billions in manufacturing scale, supply chains, and industry partnerships. QUBT has none of this. Their supposed technological edge (single-photon detection) is a known technique with its own significant drawbacks, not a magic bullet. They are entering a market with a lab prototype and a marketing slogan. Their sensing platform has no viable path to commercialization and stands zero chance against the alternatives.

In conclusion, these other ""gadgets"" are not serious products. Each one is a lab-level prototype, carefully branded with the buzzwords of a hot industry (AI, cybersecurity, autonomous vehicles) to create the illusion of a diversified, high-tech portfolio. In reality, none of these products have a credible path to generating meaningful revenue or competing in their respective markets.

**3) Lawsuits and future contracts.** QUBT is now facing multiple securities class-action lawsuits that accuse the company and its leadership of securities fraud. The allegation is that QUBT deliberately misled investors through a series of false statements and material omissions designed to artificially inflate its stock price.

A central point in the lawsuits is the systematic misrepresentation of its relationship with NASA. The company presented itself as a key strategic partner, implying its technology was integral to the space agency's operations. The lawsuits allege this was a calculated falsehood. In reality, the company had only received a few minor Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grants. These are common, low-value awards and do not represent a major strategic partnership. The plaintiffs argue that QCi improperly used the NASA brand to create a false impression of credibility and technological validation. In fact, you would be surprised how easy a company can get one of these contracts. The NASA Phase I grants QCi received were for approximately $125,000 to $150,000 each. It's the financial equivalent of a student receiving a $1,000 university grant to work on a science fair project, and then telling investors they have a major strategic partnership with the university to revolutionize the field.

The legal complaints further allege that the company created a false narrative of commercial readiness. While executives claimed to have market-ready products like the DIRAC-3 and a significant sales pipeline, the company's public financial filings reported negligible revenue. This data is presented as direct evidence that the commercial operations described to investors were a fiction. The lawsuits contend that the company was not a viable business but was merely pretending to be one to support its inflated market valuation.

Finally, the lawsuits claim that QCi made unsupported statements about its technological superiority, including achieving ""quantum advantage,"" without providing the necessary scientific proof. The plaintiffs argue that these were not good-faith claims but were technical jargon used to intentionally mislead investors who could not independently verify their accuracy. These legal actions now pose a direct threat to the company's operational stability, demanding millions in legal fees, consuming management's focus, and causing irreversible damage to its reputation.

**4) My personal note.** The field of quantum computing and its adjacent disciplines is still in its embryonic stage. It is a very active research field with a lot of math to discover, but hardware progress is extremely slow and there are no signs that it will speed up any time soon. 
Any prospect of a profitable, commercial quantum computing business remains decades away. A conservative estimate would place the timeline for consistent profitability at 20 years or more, and even then, it will only be achieved by the organization that makes fundamental breakthroughs in research. That level of discovery will not come from an underfunded startup with a negligible R&amp;D budget; it will almost certainly emerge from major research universities and/or Google and IBM. They possess scientific talent required to solve the hardest problems in science, QUBT does not.

Given this context, the valuations attached to companies like Quantum Computing Inc. are fundamentally absurd. They are not based in any recognizable financial or scientific reality. The claims made by the company's leadership are not merely optimistic; they are so far removed from the current state of the art that no credible expert in the field would support them. This disconnect is so severe that it transcends poor business strategy and enters the realm of potential securities fraud. When a company's public statements and valuation are in such stark opposition to the consensus of the scientific community, it raises serious questions that demand investigation by the appropriate financial authorities to determine if investors were willfully deceived.",731,304,1761402116.0,2025-10-25T14:21:56+00:00,t3_1ofsrr8
73,NVDA,Daily GOOGLE GOON SQUAD: $GOOGL$ is the true AI king and it’s about to print,"Fellow Regards and Degenerates,

I'm here to tell you that $GOOGL / $GOOG is the most criminally undervalued stock in mega-cap tech because it’s the undisputed leader in the technologies that define the next century. Forget the short-term noise. This is a deep dive into the strategic moat that others can't even dream of crossing.

**1. Future of Tech**

**Waymo**

Google's Waymo is WAY MORE than a competitor. It's the only fully scaled, commercialized Level 4 self-driving service available to the public. It operates 24/7 robotaxi services in multiple major US cities like Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin and testing in other cities

In San Francisco, its massive surge in volume has already resulted in its market share surpassing Lyft's, making it the city's second-most popular ride-hailing service. It’s the result of a decade-plus of calm, deep-pocketed investment, allowing it to log over 100 million fully autonomous miles and complete over 10 million paid trips. 

The sheer mileage, the complexity of the scaled deployments—which have demonstrated an 80% reduction in injury-causing crashes compared to human drivers—and the fact that they are now expanding internationally to places like Tokyo and London is a moat that no other company has even come close to building. The heck, there is no second competition in autonomous self-driving.

  
**Quantum Leap for Humanity**

The recent quantum discovery by Google, featuring its Quantum Echoes algorithm, is a major step toward making quantum computers a practical, powerful tool. This breakthrough, which demonstrated verifiable quantum advantage on the Willow quantum chip, is set to accelerate scientific discovery across key industries.

Specifically, the ability to perform verifiable quantum advantage means we can now trust a quantum computer to reliably solve real-world physics problems that are computationally infeasible for classical machines.

What Quantum Echoes Will Do

This breakthrough directly accelerates the original promise of quantum computing:

* Design Better Drugs and Cures: The Quantum Echoes algorithm ran 13,000 times faster on Willow than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This technique—which is already being used in a quantum-enhanced version of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) to study molecular structure—will dramatically cut the time it takes to discover and develop new, more effective medicines by providing unprecedented insights into how potential drug compounds interact with disease targets.
* Create Advanced New Materials: The algorithm's power to reveal previously undetectable details about atomic interactions will unlock the discovery and design of novel materials. This is vital for creating the next generation of:
   * High-Performance Batteries (for electric vehicles and energy storage).
   * More Efficient Solar Cells.
   * Lighter, Stronger Polymers for manufacturing and aerospace.

In short, Google's Quantum Echoes is an engineering milestone that moves quantum computing from a theoretical concept to a practical, verifiable machine for solving humanity's hardest scientific problems.

Think of it this way - The average age of a few generations from now will be approximately 100 years. This is truly remarkable.

  
**AI: The Medical Revolution**

AI, particularly from Google DeepMind, is already achieving breakthroughs that save time, money, and lives. This is AI's immediate, profitable impact.

* AlphaFold &amp; Isomorphic Labs: AlphaFold, an AI model from DeepMind, solved the 50-year-old problem of protein folding. This monumental achievement earned Google DeepMind's Demis Hassabis and John Jumper a share of the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry (along with David Baker). In simple terms, proteins are the body's tiny machines. Knowing their 3D shape is the blueprint for creating drugs. AlphaFold can find that blueprint in minutes, a process that used to take years. Isomorphic Labs is now using this and other advanced AI to design new small-molecule drugs from scratch at ""digital speed,"" accelerating drug discovery from years to months.
* AI and Quantum Synergy: This is where the magic happens. AI (the brain) helps guide the ultra-powerful quantum computer (the brawn) by identifying which molecules to focus on and then analyzing the quantum simulation results. This hybrid approach makes breakthroughs possible that would be computationally impossible otherwise. Google is the only company with a dominant lead in *both* technologies.

  
**2. AI Supremacy: The Foundational Architect**

The current AI boom exists because of Google, and its competitive position is strong due to decades of strategic investment focused on making powerful technology affordable enough to scale effectively. By now, it is widely known that the foundational technology for modern AI—the Transformer architecture—was created by Google.

* Models: Leading Across the Modalities Google has established market-leading or top-tier models across text, image, and video.
   * Text &amp; Multimodal: The Gemini family of models sets the pace in multimodal reasoning, handling text, code, audio, and video inputs.
   * Image (Nano Banana/Imagen): The technology powering Nano Banana (Gemini 2.5 Flash Image) excels at enterprise-critical tasks like advanced editing that preserves character/product consistency across iterations—a crucial capability for marketing and design.
   * Video (Veo): Google's cutting-edge video generation models, like Veo, are rapidly advancing the state-of-the-art in creating high-quality, long-form video content.
* Infrastructure: The TPU Efficiency Moat Google designs its own custom AI chips, the Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), which are engineered for peak AI efficiency and low-cost operation. They have spent years perfecting this hardware because a tech needs to be affordable for it to scale and work. This commitment to efficiency is so superior that competitors, including major AI labs, must increasingly rely on the latest generations of Google's custom hardware by coming to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to train and run their own cutting-edge models. This external validation proves that Google's approach is about making large-scale AI economically sensible.

The Vertical Advantage:

Google is the only major company that is competing fiercely and winning or coming close to the top in every critical layer of the AI stack:

1. Infrastructure (TPUs): Competing directly with NVIDIA on highly efficient, specialized AI silicon.
2. Foundation Models (Gemini, Imagen, Veo): Competing with OpenAI/Microsoft and Anthropic on core intelligence.
3. Applications (Nano Banana, AI Overviews): Integrating AI features into products that serve billions of users globally.

This end-to-end control, from the silicon chip to the final consumer application, provides a powerful strategic and economic advantage that is unmatched in the industry.

  
**3. The ChatGPT Myth and Search Dominance**

The idea that chatgpt will kill Google Search is a false narrative. Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Reddit all were supposed to reduce google search queries. They have only grown. This new technology has made it much easier to ask any type or questions in any language. We were previously limited to what we would or could google. Now there are no limits. The more we know, the more questions we have and the more we search. Google search will be just fine.

I think ChatGPT will become another app on the phone where users will go to. I envision it as a personal assistant and less of search. But only time will tell.

Google was and will remain the gateway to the internet. The new AI business will be a net positive for Google by creating a new revenue stream through Google Cloud (GCP) and gemini features and subscriptions to its user base.

**4. The Financial Powerhouse and PE Hypothesis**

The fundamentals confirm this giant is firing on all cylinders.

* Net Income King: Alphabet's Trailing Twelve Months net income ending June 30, 2025, was $115.573 Billion, making it one of the most profitable companies in the world. This was more than MSFT $101.832 billion and APPL $99.280 billion
* Accelerating Triple-Threat Growth: All core segments - Google Cloud, Youtube and Google Search  are growing at double-digit rates.

The core reason Google's Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio is generally lower than many other tech companies is its revenue mix being heavily dominated by consumer advertising.

  
Simply put, investors are willing to pay a higher multiple (PE) for the more predictable, higher-margin, and rapidly growing recurring revenue streams typical of enterprise software and cloud platforms.

My hypothesis is with AI increasingly driving revenue through Google Cloud Platform (GCP), the enterprise segment will become a bigger component of Google's business mix, and hence, the company will earn a higher blended Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio. This is because Enterprise and Cloud businesses are valued more highly, providing predictable, high-margin, recurring subscription revenue (SaaS), a financial profile superior to advertising. As this higher-multiple segment captures a greater share of Google's overall profit, the market will be forced to re-rate $GOOGL with a higher blended multiple, making the current valuation—which is depressed by the ad-centric multiple look like a significant undervaluation and a compelling investment opportunity.

  
TLDR : GOOGL is a generational buy. You're buying the best-in-class *present* (Search/Maps/YouTube), the scaled *near-future* (Waymo/GCP), and the *long-term future* (Quantum/AI Core Tech) at a discount.

74,NVDA,INTC Is A Sleeping Dragon,"https://preview.redd.it/cneb9e699wwf1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98cf08539a407513c6ba31936b34601c2b164024

# INTC IS A SLEEPING DRAGON

**TLDR; No tldr, you have to read it and make an educated decision**

# Intro

I've been researching INTC ever since China started taking more interest in supporting the war in Ukraine. With the orange man talking about how he will not aid NATO in EU it got me thinking. Why would he say that? Could they be gearing up for a multi-front war and wouldn't be able to stretch their forces?

I put on my tin foil hat and started digging in. Taiwan is obviously a very important geopolitical player due to their advanced microchip manufacturing. Recall what chaos happened when COVID struck and TSMC fell behind,.. It took several years to recover. So here I am thinking, who is the only microchip manufacturer that can produce a microchip from nothing.

INTC

# 8-10 Months ago - First play, didn't post DD but regret

Before Trumps election I was looking into their fundamentals and I came to a simple conclusion:

* They were **undervalued at &lt; $20**, because book value was approx. $22.5 at the time

I hesitated but eventually bought in when it went up to $20.12. Buying 800 shares. The idea behind the play was simple, INTC is a critical US asset:

* They are a DoD contractor, all the chips in any weapons, computers, gps ... chances are it's Intel.
* They are the only manufacturer that can produce chips from the ground up
* New CEO with a very good track record of turning around dying companies

**Problems INTC faced:**

* A lot of investments into startups, they tried to be like Microsoft but failed miserably
* Very bad middle management and disproportionately big for the company (I even have some insider info from this)
* Innovation was stalling (well except for a few things)

**Advantages of INTC:**

* Servers are still predominantely INTC, although they were losing ground
* TEE dominance, if you need a trusted execution environment - you will use INTCs SGX (and now they're newer one)
* FHE investments - for those who don't know Fully Homomorphic Encryption is the ""holy grail of encryption"", most of FHE schemes are also QUANTUM resistant

# CEO fixed most problems

CEO started doing all the right plays

* Fired a lot of the middle management and made the company lean
* Sold other investments that they had which was good even if it was a loss to generate money
* Started focusing INTC to be engineer-first again

I expected a $60 PT within 3 years on INTC as a very pessimistic/conservative estimate.

# Trump invests, SoftBank invests, NVIDIA

I expected Trump and I did expect some bank funding, what I didn't expect was NVIDIA but it makes sense.

AMD was gaining ground with their GPUs and although NVDA is much better when it comes to:

* Infra, i.e. networking for HPCs
* Software, i.e. cuda
* Results

NVDA knew that it's just a matter of time when AMD catches ground. So how do you fix this issue? You advance your technology or you make sure that you have preferential treatment at the available foundries.

# The new DD, Mystery client unveiling

I was extremely mad, when on one day I forgot to buy my 1 year leaps for $40 CALLS on INTC, because the next day I see that NVDA invests and suddenly the premiums were 3x. But I still bought, and now I'm buying more. This time I plan on writing my DD to explain why.

I've kept on researching and trying to assess if they will gain more ground. Why would NVDA invest? What technology does INTC have that AMD/TSMC does not?

Well as I've investigated I found several exciting pieces of information:

1. The CEO of INTC has invested and is on the board of a Swiss startup that not so long ago demonstrated a new microchip cooling technology this new micro-fluid cooling technology is supplementary to traditional cooling. And here's the kicker... MSFT has interest in this startup as well [https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/innovation/microfluidics-liquid-cooling-ai-chips/](https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/innovation/microfluidics-liquid-cooling-ai-chips/). So why is this impressive? Well for starters it's 3x more effective than traditional cooling (and that's just the start). A lot of datacenters have to waste money not only to power the GPUs themselves, but to also power the cooling. But it has another kicker and I will get to that in the next chapter as it has even BIGGER implications.
2. INTC has technology that sets it apart from TSMC and gives them a year-two head start. This technology is called ""backside power delivery"". To put it briefly, you power it from the back of the wafer instead of the front, where it needs to go through multiple layers of metal -&gt; each layer adds resistance -&gt; voltage drops, heat goes up -&gt; wasted power, more cooling needed -&gt; more wasted power. So again, less power? Less cooling? Two different technologies?
3. Now there are rumors about a potential big client for new AI datacenters and it's rumored that it's MSFT. Well I'm pretty certain it is MSFT -&gt; see the first point. A big client that will manufacture in INTC foundries will mean the foundry will start printing money. Let me clarify for you, NVDA invested and shared tech, but didn't manufacture YET.
4. Why would NVDA share GPU tech with INTC? Well because they figured out that INTC 18A is happening and it's gonna be a bomb with the lower power input needed. Specifically for laptops. Now you're gonna have laptops with Intel and NVDA cramming up the market. People will develop more (think of it as a vendor-lock) for NVDA (CUDA) and the demand for NVDA datacenters will grow. Because it will grow, and TSMC is already filled to the brim with orders, you need to get manufacturing done somewhere else, so why not with INTC CPUs - The tech was already tested for several years anyway and more importantly. It will create a bigger foothold for NVDA GPU datacenters. Remember you have to wait like a year or two before you get a H100.

This means that the NVDA investment was a long term strategic investment.

# Ok so what's the big deal about cooling - why it's so important?

Well one of the main reasons and I'm gonna keep it short here is that if you want to shrink transistors, you need to be able to cool them. The smaller you go, the more they start failing in high heat and the more you have of them the more it heats up. The road to &lt;2nm tech is through improved cooling especially due to things like quantum tunneling. The moment you go to 1nm quantum tunneling is a thing and transistors start leaking energy because electrons behave like waves -&gt; power loss and heat. With advanced cooling you can overcome this.

Here comes a little bit of quantum hype... Have you heard about the Majorana-1 chip? Yes, developed by microsoft. INTC is more than ever setting itself up to become the main goto manufacturer of quantum microchips.

# Foundries are fully operational

Arizona’s Fab 52 is fully operational and set to reach high-volume production using Intel 18A later this year, strengthening U.S. technology and manufacturing leadership. They are already producing 18A chips that they debuted not so long ago and are already being shipped to clients.

# A hidden shark

There was one big client of INTC that was very unhappy with the fact that the chips were overheating, AAPL. There are rumors they are looking into INTC and see how they perform. Additional rumors indicate that they might test them out with ""less flashy"" orders like apple remotes etc.

# Possible manufacturing bottleneck

There is a possibility that INTC will become the new manufacturing bottleneck - such an event would explode INTC's price up.

# PT

These are my estimates and will cause me to reconsider my long term strategy depending on how it goes:

Overly Optimistic: $80+ within a 1 year  
Optimistic: $100+ within 2-3 years.  
Realistic/Pessimistic: $80 in 2 years.

# So why invest now?

Company is back on track, has secured a lot of funding/investments, has strong govermental support and rising tensions with China play into INTCs cards. The company is completely restructured and set to be innovative, they have a strong base and good book value to be ""start-up like"" but with actual ground to stand on.

# Catalysts and what to look out for

Possibly positive catalysts:

* Earning Calls are expected to be very positive. Might also include the reveal of the client, but doubt it. Depending on what they share the price might skyrocket
* Jan26, we will have news about the Arizona FAB 52 and how well it's performing
* Q4 2025, Q2, Q3 2026 earning calls -&gt; These will have the most impact in the upcoming year with Q4 being the biggest.
* Higher tensions in Russian-Ukranian war. China has funded Russia and in return requested paratrooper training. The longer the RU/UA war goes the higher the chance China will decide to go for Taiwan.
* Autumn / April of each year going onwards. This is the window if I'm not mistaken when there aren't high seas in the taiwan strait, making it possible to perform an amphibious landing.

Negative catalysts:

* Jan26, failing production
* Q2-Q3, failing interest in 18A - undelivered promises, overheats etc.
* TSMC moves advance tech on US soil (unlikely, will incentives US to abandon Taiwan)

# What am I doing?

Increasing my position with leaps **before and after earning calls**. As the current earning calls can have the opposite effect given what's been happening lately.

P.S. Sorry for grammar mistakes, I didn't use chatgpt or any other autocorrect to write this.

**DISCLAIMER: This is not financial advice, invest only at your own risk and after doing some additional research into the company. Keep in mind that INTC was very violent and jumpy the last few years. My position is bullish, but market downturn or recession can happen at any moment.**

**EDIT 28.10. pre-market:** I have a reasonable suspicion to believe that AMD might also be the AI client. If that's the case it won't be because of the actual main chip manufacturing but possibly microcontrollers etc.  
I consider this more of a tinfoil conspiracy, given the latest news regarding AMD AI Datacenter, financed by DoE. However if it is truly MSFT then this is even bigger because of their stake in OpenAI [https://x.com/unusual\_whales/status/1983161407802941901?s=46](https://x.com/unusual_whales/status/1983161407802941901?s=46)",43,99,1761239525.0,2025-10-23T17:12:05+00:00,t3_1oe92la
75,NVDA,"INTC DEGEN DILIGENCE PT 3 (1/5 PORT, ~60k scalped ALL TIME)","If you look at the space Intel competes in... ok, AMD and Nvidia, Qualcomm etc. These are all American companies that are not state-backed. So it feels unfair that Intel is USG backed... It feels wrong to bet on a stock that so many have been burned on before. 

Just stop. TSMC is state backed. TSMC = Taiwan. And Samsung = Korea, who is also state backed. SMIC = China, who is also state backed... every major Asian foundry is state backed. So it's arguably MORE free market for Intel to be state backed, and REALLY annoying that analysts and retail investors alike cannot wrap their heads around this. 

It would be like running a race but everyone else is cheating, and then when you decide to cheat, everyone complains!

Then by extension, if TSMC is state backed, and Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm etc. rely on TSMC, by extension, the Taiwanese government is backing Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm etc. Since you can't make a chip without a fab, TSMC is the missing half of many of these companies. So overall, the ""free market"" isn't and wasn't ever free once TSMC and Samsung started to dominate. If anything, it is unamerican. 

If you want to be a high end fab and compete in the world stage... you must be state backed. This step has already been completed, and INTC has been moving faster than ever before.

In fact, Intel never had a chance before this administration. 

But now? Saudi investments, NVDA, rumors of more, (potential) OpenAI involvement that they missed out on beforehand, Lip Bu-Tan’s success rate, US Foundry + Taiwanese conflicts, Rare Earth company collaborations, etc etc etc. Also, the USG planning on spending $20T into investments? They are as degen as us and might as well DCA / use their influence to force companies into Intel Foundry use.

Earnings guidance will be good, and the pump will continue till end of year if Trump so pleases. Expect more from Intel for the years to come, as it truly is too big to fail.

77,NVDA,Meta – DD From a Senior Finance Manager,"My favorite earnings play this quarter is one of the bigger companies, Meta (Q3 earnings 10/29/25 after market closes). I strongly believe Meta will beat earnings this upcoming quarter due to the following:

1. EPS Historical trends – Meta has **beat** the last 8 earnings cycles. From a management perspective, compensation is almost always tied to beating earnings and it’s up to senior management to push back on sand bagged forecasts. When a company beats earnings for 8 cycles in a row, it’s likely upper management are not pushing back too hard on goal setting forecasts, which makes it more likely that they will also beat earnings this cycle.

https://preview.redd.it/4carlwaqthwf1.png?width=784&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=610b5c9521adcf4c8d4f8734a61d90336b26023e

2. CapEx Spend – **Meta is planning on increasing capex spend from $39.2b in 2024 to $66b+ in 2025 to targeting $100b in 2026**. In the first half of 2025 alone, capex spend was already $30.7b, largely around investment in AI infrastructure. From a Corporate Finance perspective, there are usually capex reviews on a monthly-quarterly basis. By October 2025, I’d expect the 2026 plan to be completed and possibly the plan up to 2030 to be completed. Capex approval is usually closely related to future revenue. If the team is projecting that revenue will be flat, capex will usually also need to be flat. Given that there is an approval for significant increase in capex spend, revenue projections should be out the roof. Whether or not actual revenue comes in at those projections will be next years problem as the stock bump will come in when they announce the upward revised rev projections.

3. AI Industry Bullish – In the past year, the AI industry has been extremely bullish. Bigger players like Nvidia and AMD have gone up 30 – 90% while smaller players around the AI industry, like quantum computing companies IONQ (46% YTD) and RGTI (132% YTD) or nuclear energy companies like UUUU (270%) and OKLO (648%) have gone up in greater magnitudes. It seems like whenever a big deal gets done involving AI, the company involved sees a big stock bump. Each of these AI companies are up well over 50% since June. Meanwhile, **Meta has been flat since June** and up 20% on the year. This indicates that Meta still has a lot of potential to run up as an AI play.

For those that argue that Meta isn’t an AI play, Meta has just announced in October a $1.5b investment to build AI-focused datacenters in Texas, $14b agreement with AI cloud provider CoreWeave, and financing a $30b datacenter complex in Louisiana. **Given these recent Q3 investments, I believe a large focus of the Q3 earnings to be around how Meta will be a massive AI play (through providing AI-focused datacenters/infrastructure).**

 

**Potential Issues**

With any play, there will be concerns for the play moving in the opposite direction. These are what I see to be the biggest areas of concern for Wallstreet.

1. Large Capex spend – Wallstreet usually doesn’t like significant increases in spending. Note that this is actually also my second point for beating earnings. I believe it’ll be unlikely that Meta simply just says they are doubling capex without any support. In my mind, management will either show significant revenue increases or some other way to justify the increase in capex.

2. Ad Market Concerns – If Meta indicates weak ad demand for the upcoming quarter/year, then that can cause the stock to go down. However, I read recently that AI-powered recommendation models boosted conversions by upwards of 3-5%. Management could definitely use this justification as to why they are supporting AI. Given the magnitude of the capex increase from 2024-2026 though, I just don’t really see them communicating weak ad market demand. It just doesn’t really make sense to communicate a weakening market while simultaneously communicating massive spending increases.

3. User engagement risk – As a social media platform, investors look at Meta’s daily active users as an indication of Meta’s earning potential. Just last month, Zuckerberg announced a record high over 3b daily active users. There has been no real indication that user engagement is at risk.

**The Play**

**My play here is to hold a mix of Meta stocks and call options**. I have calls expiring 10/31 and 11/07 around the current price simply to capture my expected earnings boost, while my shares are there for long-term holding. One note: my personal opinion is that we are in an AI-bubble and at some point the bubble will likely burst. If that happens before Meta earnings comes out, our portfolios are probably already cooked anyways. Below are my positions:

79,NVDA,Last Chance NVTS Lottery Tickets,"TLDR: Navitas is a US-based semiconductor company that uses better power conversion than competitors while demand grows. New designs, major contracts, and upcoming earnings make it a great buy right now unless you’re scared of the casino.

The AI bull run is still showing no signs of stopping. Major names like NVDA and ORCL have largely fulfilled their opportunities to moon at this time, leaving smaller, more speculative companies on the betting table. AI has raised several accompanying sectors in its rally, including companies that feed into its need for power, data centers, and semiconductors.

This is where Navitas Semiconductor (NVTS) comes in. Robinhood leads its description as, “engag[ing] in the development of ultra-efficient gallium nitride (GaN) semiconductors.” GaN semiconductors are the technological successor to silicon power conversion which is quickly becoming antiquated among systems that demand cool, compact, power-efficient semiconductors. 

They are not the first to use GaN technology; however, they do produce the only GaN, fully integrated circuits under their trademark GaNFast™ monolithic integrated chips. This differs from competitors (e.g. IFNNY) because NVTS produces a fully GaN product as opposed to GaN components bottlenecked by silicon parts in the final product.

Another pro is that they work directly with companies to integrate themselves into final products as opposed to being limited by distributors or as components. Essentially, their existing partnerships with big names like Lenovo, Dell, and SolarEdge are designed to work around them—a system design that secures a long-term destiny for the company considering no one can switch away from them on a whim as it would mean completely redesigning their products.

Obviously, their most important deal with Nvidia is the recent milestone that may have put them on some of your radars with them commissioned to provide the semiconductors for their new data centers set to be built in late 2026 or early 2027. The first samples are expected to be shipped sometime this quarter.

With semiconductors being used in just about everything technologically relevant nowadays—computers, phones, EVs—it’s not far-fetched to believe they will be securing additional deals from other big names. They have the most power-efficient system available to date at a time whn every major growth sector is looking for power solutions. 

As for other catalysts, earnings are fast approaching (AH, 11/3) when their revenue has trended up each quarter. Growing geopolitical tensions and administration’s desire to limit offshore dependence may see the power shift from dominant foreign entities like TSM to domestic. The climate is poised to return NVTS to their ATH of $20.16 or well past.

In terms of risk, they are still currently unprofitable entailing some dilution risk. Competition among larger names like Infineon and Texas Instruments is still possible, although my thesis regarding the growing reliance on and demand for GaN suggests the odds are on Navitas’ side.

My recommended position: Jan 16 calls ATM. NVTS more than has the potential to exceed ATH before the end of this year.

80,NVDA,"$SSYS: Certified to Print Drones, Aerospace parts, and Tendies","I’m long SSYS as I believe it is a massive sleeper play when it comes to drone/aircraft development and American military industrialization/ expansion.

**Executive Summary:** 

Stratasys ( $SSYS) is a leading additive manufacturing company with a strong installed base and differentiated position in polymer 3D printing for industrial applications. A particularly compelling growth driver for this company lies in its aerospace and defense vertical, where Stratasys is one of the few players with qualified thermoplastics (e.g., ULTEM 9085/1010) and certified processes for flight-ready parts. This position benefits from the aerospace sector’s record backlog and from the defense departments demand for lightweight, durable components in contemporary aircraft and drones where additive manufacturing enables on-demand part replacement, weight reduction, and customization. Military adoption is accelerating due to the need for distributed logistics and digital warehousing, with Stratasys printers already being deployed for tooling, brackets, housings, and spare parts in aging aircraft fleets. Looking ahead, further integration of automation and AI for generative design could transform Stratasys from a hardware vendor into a critical software-enabled platform for mission-critical manufacturing, creating sticky revenue streams and strategic relevance in defense supply chains. 

**Stratasys Strategic Positioning in Aerospace/Defense Supply Chains**

Aerospace and defense primes (Boeing, Lockheed, Northrop, Airbus, etc.) have extremely stringent certification standards for parts. Stratasys’ Fused Deposition Modeling and ULTEM 9085/1010 thermoplastics are among the few already qualified for flight-ready parts. This creates a high barrier to entry for competitors. Once qualified, these parts become part of multi-year aircraft programs, locking Stratasys into recurring revenue streams (THINK -&gt; strong qualification &amp; certification moat for Stratasys).

Furthermore, 3D printing close to the point of need reduces dependence on fragile global supply chains. Stratasys is positioning its printers as tools for distributed manufacturing, especially in forward-deployed military operations (THINK -&gt; DoD &amp; NATO supply chain security).

**Revenue Acceleration Levers**

Defense contractors don’t just buy one 3D printer, they often roll them out across multiple facilities once qualification is achieved. Each printer also locks in recurring high-margin consumables like filaments and resins. Furthermore, Stratasys direct manufacturing could see DoD contracts for on-demand spare part printing, turning the company into a “digital warehouse” for legacy aircraft parts. For example, the Air Force has thousands of aging aircraft (C-130, KC-135, F-16) where traditional parts are obsolete. Additive manufacturing is one of the only viable solutions. (THINK -&gt; Pseudo razor and blades business model when it comes to a 3D printer install base and subsequent high-margin consumables and on-demand part production services).

To further expand on this “digital warehousing” concept… The DoD has an initiative for a military digital thread that focuses on creating a comprehensive, secure, and interconnected system of digital assets and data across the entire lifecycle of a defense system, from conceptualization to sustainment. This includes the idea of storing qualified part files in secure databases with the subsequent goal of manufacturing or printing them on demand at needed locations. The technology/product that Stratasys provides directly aligns with the Pentagon’s logistics resilience goal. And this military digital thread initiative will only further expand as defense budgets increase globally (esp. in NATO, Indo-Pacific and South America) where additive manufacturing helps with distributed logistics.

**Technology Roadmap &amp; Differentiation**

Stratasys is moving into carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastics and high-temp polymers (PEKK, PEI blends) that can replace aluminum in aerospace parts. There are multiple defense applications for this:

* Lightweight ducting, housings, brackets in aircraft.
* Drone/UAV structural parts (where low weight and quick customization are critical).
* Tooling &amp; jigs for production lines, an overlooked but large revenue stream.

Furthermore, Stratasys isn’t just about hardware, it’s about locking customers into a digital ecosystem (GrabCAD Print, software certification layers, material traceability). Much like NVIDIA uses its CUDA software stack to create switching costs and capture value well beyond the GPU itself, Stratasys is building a certification and compliance-driven ecosystem that embeds its technology deep into aerospace and defense supply chains, making it difficult and costly for customers to move elsewhere.

Overall, all of this positions Stratasys as not just a printer maker but a platform company in the defense supply chain… recurring SaaS/service revenues layered on hardware + consumables.

**Strategic Positioning in Drones/UAVs**

Stratasys technology amplifies drone manufacturing/development through rapid prototyping, lightweight, topology-optimized structures, and high-performance polymer materials like carbon fiber and nylon, driving weight reduction critical to UAV endurance and performance. Their additive tech enables custom, mission-specific components such as payload mounts, brackets, and battery compartments enabling faster product iterations and on-demand production. There are great real world proofs for this -&gt; Aurora Flight Sciences printed a jet-powered UAV with 80% of its structural parts in ULTEM 9085 resin, achieving over 150 mph with a 50% reduction in time-to-market.

[Link 1](https://imgur.com/a/2a2Z6jk)

[Link 2](https://imgur.com/a/agf7v8w) 

Furthermore, the U.S. Army is leaning hard into 3D printing for drones to cut costs, boost training realism, and reduce reliance on foreign supply chains. Units like the 101st Airborne, Hawaii’s 25th Infantry Division and the Oregon National Guard are already utilizing 3D printing for low-cost UAS at scale.

[Link 3](https://imgur.com/a/veBKaEC) 

As additive manufacturing builds on and moves from prototypes/experiments to repeated utilization and eventually military doctrine, the financial opportunity clearly turns into recurring demand for printers + materials across the defense ecosystem as I have mentioned above, Stratasys' aerospace/drones verticle is set to take off just watch. Stratasys is set up to be a quiet but critical enabler, a drones picks and shovels play that almost no investors have yet to identify... YET.  

**AI in print process optimization**

Traditional 3D printing is trial-and-error intensive. Aerospace/defense requires near-zero defect tolerance. Stratasys incorporates generative AI principles, such as generative design, within its additive manufacturing solutions by collaborating with software partners like Autodesk to create optimized, lightweight parts. This improves yield rates (fewer failed builds), lowers scrap, and makes additive competitive for higher-volume aerospace parts. Stratasys benefits when engineers use AI to create lighter, more complex, organic structures that only additive can manufacture. This increases margin leverage; less waste, higher throughput, accelerates qualification for critical parts and further establishes a moat with their software + hardware.

**TLDR Bulleted summary of most important points:**

* Sticky Vertical - Aerospace/defense is highly regulated, which favors Stratasys once certified.
* Recurring Revenue Growth – Every installed printer drives materials + service revenue, often more valuable than hardware.
* Software complements hardware – Stratasys has a certification and compliance driven ecosystem that makes it difficult and costly for customers to move elsewhere for additive manufacturing (parallels to how NVIDIA utilizes CUDA).
* Macro Tailwinds – Pentagon pushing for resilient supply chains. Increasing defense budgets globally      (esp. in NATO, Indo-Pacific and South America) will likely require additive manufacturing as it support distributed logistics. Commercial aerospace backlogs are at record highs, large aerospace companies will likely need additive manufacturing to scale production.
* Drones &amp; UAVs - Stratasys technology can greatly amplify drone development and manufacturing
* AI Optimization – Stratasys is poised to benefit from AI more than most other military defense and manufacturing companies based on their unique technology and moat

As a redditor of 16 years, I decided to cash in my years of redditing by full porting not only my account but my parents' as well into RDDT after having completely missed the 2024 rally. From the peak at $282, I expected a ""moderate"" pullback of 15% but was kicked in the balls with a 30% drawdown, wiping out $1mil in profits. Dad calls me asking me, should we should sell? I tell him, no, we buy more, and so we did.

Despite all the price target raises to $300, PT reiterates at $300, talks of negotiating a new AI deal with Google, high likelihood of settling with Anthropic in mediation, massive earnings beat, and guidance raise far beyond what the Street was expecting, RDDT continued to sell off far beyond a normal range when the rest of the market was continuing to rip to new ATHs day after day. The reduced ChatGPT citation news then came out of nowhere and dropped RDDT another 15% despite having already corrected 15% from the peak. And over the past few days, RDDT continued on the struggle bus with the market ripping.

Something felt off. And so, I decided to add some *wrinkles* to my smoothe brain.



# 🧠 What My Smoothe Brain Thought Was the 🌈 Bear Case

* **“RDDT was overbought.”** *Sure, the stock had run up a lot (relative strength was high). A cooldown was expected. This might explain a* ***normal*** *correction, but not a 30% crash on high volume. Even the 0 revenue quantum stocks hasn't corrected this much in this rate cutting cycle environment.*
* **Decrease in DAU** on sites like Semrush:

* **ChatGPT reduction in citations**:

   * *ChatGPT citations alone don't bring that much traffic to reddit and only account for 5% of RDDT's revenue, so another 15% drop seemed too much especially in the context of a* [new deal being negotiated with Google](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/reddit-stock-ai-deal-google-openai/)*.

   * *We all learned in high school not to cite Wikipedia, but we still use it because it's useful. Imagine our teachers' faces when reddit comments were being cited by ChatGPT as primary sources. Just because reddit isn't cited, doesn't mean it's not being used at all.*

This entire selloff just seemed too much for RDDT to drop after such stellar earnings and even stronger guidance in this environment where the [MEME ETF ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meme-stock-resurgence-prompts-return-184355645.html)returned from the grave and ARKK is up 61% YTD. It just didn't make sense.

This was when my smoothe brain formed its first wrinkle. I then remembered there was a non-sense hearing scheduled for 10:00am on Oct. 8 which I ignored the first time around. It sounded like it'd be a meme hearing when I imagined u/spez, Gaben, Discord, and Twitch testifying in front of Congress. I also figured out it wasn't going to happen due to the government shutdown as this was the most non-essential government hearing that I've ever heard of.

Despite all this, RDDT continued to dump 5% and on Oct. 8 right at 10:00am on the day of the originally scheduled hearing when it was clear the hearing was postponed, RDDT bounced. I thought to myself, did we actually bounce because the hearing was canceled. **Then it clicked. My second wrinkle** popped into existence. I downed my Red Bulls and put together this timeline.

# 🤯From Smoothe Brain to Wrinkley Brain

After putting together this timeline and matching it up against the way RDDT has been moving over the past 3 weeks, everything made so much more sense. There were enough examples of global radicalism linked to social media, to the point it spooked bulls.

The smart money took profits and the **🌈** Bears shorted RDDT bigly, betting that u/spez would be crucified at the hearing. At the hearing, **Spez would be in a lose/lose situation** where his only option would be to confirm that reddit does not allow doxxing, bans users who threaten violence, etc. and **agree to do whatever the Congressional circus** demands him to do, otherwise, **they would threaten to remove reddit's** [**Section 230 immunity**](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R46751) which would **result in reddit being liable** as a publisher for what redditors post. **A death sentence ☠️ for reddit and all social media companies**.

This would of course be perceived by redditors as a capitulating on free speech, and I'm sure many redditors would threaten to leave. Spez also can't pull a Zuck and donate to Trump as this would piss off most redditors even more.

The concession I speculate Spez made was by proactively sunsetting of public chats. While I find this feature is helpful at times for subreddits like r/redditstock, I don't use it much personally but I know other redditors love it. What I can see happening is bad actors using it for nefarious purposes. It wouldn't surprise me if there may have been a few ""Antifun"" individuals who abused this community function which resulted in getting this feature disabled for everyone.

In the context of these outbreaks of violence with social media being used by bad actors, I speculate that Sam Altman, an 8.7% shareholder of RDDT and former reddit CEO of 4 days, may have expedited an update to reduce reddit citations given that only a month prior, reddit was frequently cited making up 41% of LLM citations. Or this was pure coincidence but the timing just seemed a bit sus. Either way, Altman wouldn't want to risk being on Trump's shitlist and risk Trump accusing ChatGPT of being woke due to a high citation percentage of reddit. That would risk development of Star Gate.

What I completely disagree with is commentary from some analysts who argued that reddit data and OpenAI's relationship with reddit is any less valuable after this change. Reddit is incredibly valuable for sentiment analysis and for verifying if a product with thousands of 5 star reviews is actually legitimate. Like random ass Chinese bluetooth headphones from Xyrbx with a 4.95 rating and over 3,000 reviews. Reddit sentiment analysis would easily flag that as being fake af.



# 🔬Testing My Theory

If my interpretation of the timeline holds true, I thought that one way to test this is to see how META moved during this time, even though they weren't invited for the hearing. And look, META and RDDT's movement look quite similar. The major risk to all social media companies is if Trump were to threaten the removal of Section 230 immunity . But with the ""Antifun"" terrorist designation, well, that causes an even bigger problem for all social media companies.

AMZN (Twitch/Hassan Piker) and NFLX (streaming service of Money Heist which popularized the song Bella Ciao which was declared to be the anthem of ""Antifun"") also moved similarly to RDDT and META since September. All 4 stocks started to recover yesterday as I believe ""Antifun"" short covering started.

And if there was a lot of fear with civil uprisings, I thought, why not look into opening up a trade in guns and gold if you have govenment topplings happen. Gun stocks are up 30% from September, and GLD is at the moon. So yes, there was a clear systematic trade that bet on all this and those trades are reversing.



# 💎💰🚀The Trade Thesis

The **🌈** Bears positioned for an Oct 8 hearing without realizing that the hearing was postponed due to the government shutdown. After seeing that the ""Antifun"" roundtable didn't trigger a full on collapse below yesterday's support, this signaled that the ""Antifun"" trade bottomed out and the covering started. Options flow yesterday showed a lot of puts being sold and the return of 🐂🐳Bull whales with **$7.5M** in **210 and 220 strike June 2027 calls** which sparked a lot more call buying and confirmation of the bull flag breakout.

There are still a lot more **🌈** Bears who haven't made this ""Antifun"" short connection and still think all of this is related to RDDT being a meme, is no longer useful to AI, and will miss on earnings. They're about to get blown out as **Polymarket puts the shutdown ending after 10/15 at 85% odds**. RDDT earnings is on Oct 30, so there is only a limited window for the hearing to be scheduled before earnings. I actually see **RDDT as a hedge for a prolonged shutdown** as this just delays the upcoming hearing.

With \~16-18% short interest, RDDT's tiny float, and an earnings blackout period coming up, the time is now to give the **🌈** Bears a new gap. With an expected earnings blow out and the hearing having already been priced in, I think we'll break to new ATHs post earnings. I do expect a moderate pullback once the hearing is officially rescheduled but view the hearing as a buy the news event.

After a new ATH and 2 back-to-back rate cuts, this would make RDDT a top contender for S&amp;P 500 inclusion in the December S&amp;P 500 balancing. RDDT was skipped in September despite the 4 consecutive quarters of profit. Just look at how APP and HOOD ripped after the inclusion. Except this would be during the Santa Claus rally and complete index rebalancing in the last trading day of December. 🚀🚀🚀

88,NVDA,US Approves Nvidia GPU Sales to UAE Worth Up to $20 Billion a Year,"The U.S. government has approved Nvidia to export advanced AI GPUs such as the H100 and newer Blackwell models to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and potentially other Middle Eastern buyers.  
The approval reportedly stems from a broader U.S.–UAE AI partnership, allowing Nvidia to sell high-end chips to companies like G42, which has deep ties to AI research and regional infrastructure projects.

# 💰 Estimated Financial Impact

* Annual export cap: up to 500,000 GPUs
* Estimated unit price: up to $40,000 per GPU
* Annual max revenue: $20 billion
* 3-year potential (2025–2027): $60 billion
* 6-year extended potential (through 2030): $120 billion

While official reports (Reuters, Bloomberg) only describe “several-billion-dollar” exports, the maximum potential value based on full annual allocation and high-end chip pricing could reach $120 billion over a six-year term.

90,NVDA,30K YOLO on uiPATH - The $PATH to generational wealth,"Greetings fellow crayon eaters, if you’ve been missing this AI bubble that is just getting started, then you’re a pathetic loser. *BUT you’re in luck*, because i’m here to present you with a play that is ready to run 1000%, and is actually… dare i say, UNDERVALUED in this market environment. Only up 18% YTD? Pathetic. This has the potential for upwards of **$40-50** ***THIS YEAR***

The ticker? $PATH

And it's your PATH to finally getting a  taste of the big gains this market has to offer.

**What the fuck does PATH do?**

In short, PATH builds Robotic Process Automations (RPAs) to automate repetitive tasks. Meaning, path will probably build the AI that runs the robot that replaces you, so hopefully your wife’s boyfriend can support you both. For more details, search the fucking internet, idiot. I gotta keep it short enough for your attention span. 

**Why is PATH so beaten up?**

It came too early… *just like you*, loser. 

PATH went public in 2021 at $65.50 per share. It was seen as a next generation darling by Aunt Cathie Wood, and pumped to an all time high of 90. BUTTT…  the overall market and economy was not ready for what PATH had to offer: Robotics and AI. If you’re not brainrotted too much to remember 2021, the hype was EVs and green energy. Nobody gave a shit about AI or robotics. Then the 2022 bear market came and wiped the speculative stocks. PATH was a victim of that.

The nail in the coffin was May 29, 2024, when the company announced a CEO change and lowered their yearly guidance. The stock dropped 30% that day and still has a gap there. Aunt Cathie ended up selling for a loss… (you know what that means!) 

Since then it found a floor of $10 a share which it has tested multiple times.

https://preview.redd.it/rmbrdz23ovtf1.png?width=938&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f59af1605fcf421a3264968abe2ef0eef65d4ecd

**Today is a completely different story**.

PATH has stumbled into a fucking golden opportunity…. AI, robotics, and automation. They have weathered the storm of CEO change, and have established reliable income streams.

**2025 Partnerships:**

**As of October 2025, PATH has established new partnerships with:**

**Nvidia, OpenAI, Salesforce, and Snowflake. Yeah thats right, the motherfucking work horses of the modern market, NVDA and OPENAI**

This is IN ADDITION to their existing partnerships and clients: Microsoft, Google Cloud, SAP, and Amazon. 

**Earnings trends:** *PATH has beat revenue expectations 8 times in a row… and beat EPS expectations 7 of the last 8 earnings.* 

https://preview.redd.it/d8x0jx17ovtf1.png?width=917&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e38c9aa90ea87072a1fe66d38c756b2a98dbe32

**What’s next?**

PATH has projected both EPS and revenue growth. The best part? Projections have not been raised since the new partnerships, meaning PATH is poised to surprise to the upside for earnings in December, and the market is *just now beginning to price that in.*

**TA / Options pricing - THIS IS BIG**

Bullish all time macD reversal with a gap to fill at $19. Resistance at 15, but setup to break through it after four tests by bulls in the past year, and recently with incredible volume not seen since the gap down from the CEO leaving, indicating big money is poised to capture the upside. 

***IV is considerably low at for at the money options when compared to the IV of other AI stocks, it’s currently sitting at 60-75%. This is HUGE. Options are currently critically undervalued for a stock that is poised to break to the upside and be major AI play for the year.*** 

In comparison, other market AI darlings like RZLV iv 141% for at the money, APLD 137%, SOUN 110%, RR 190%

*For you smooth brains, this means call option prices have room to absolutely skyrocket once this breaks out.* 

Current short interest per fintel is 12%. Short interest can help drive the upside breakout as shorts look to exit near 5 year lows as Bulls once again take charge.

Since dropping to $10 a share, we can see from the volume profile that there has been significant accumulation of shares in the $10-14 range, and we are just beginning to break away from that into a volume gap that will eventually take the stock into the $20's

It's just broken over the 200D MA and backtested it, bouncing hard following a small dip from profit taking after the NVDA partnership announcement.

91,NVDA,First Leveraged Short Ever,"Just opened my first leveraged short — $400,000 in IONZ, the 2x inverse of IONQ. Felt right to start my career betting against literal science fiction.

IONQ is worth $23.5B on $52M in revenue. That’s a 451x price-to-sales ratio — higher than anything from the dot-com bubble, AI bubble, or even tulips. Q2 numbers? $20.7M in revenue, $177.5M net loss, -708% margin, and burning $340M a year. At this pace, they’ll discover time travel before profitability.

Insiders clearly agree — the CEO cashed out $105M, the CFO and a director dumped nearly everything, and yet retail still thinks they’re building the next NVIDIA while 80% of their revenue comes from government research contracts, not real customers.

Base case: stock back to $5–10.

94,NVDA,$POET - Someone Just Dropped $75M In and Won't Say Who (We Find Out Oct 17),"Alright so I've been digging into this POET Technologies thing because of that dumb fuck who keeps posting shit about them in the DDs so I said what the hell I'll take a look.

POET makes optical chips that connect GPUs in AI data centers. Not the GPUs themselves, the networking shit between them. Everyone's throwing money at NVIDIA for the chips but nobody's paying attention to the fact that when you have thousands of these things clustered together they need to talk to each other at insane speeds. That's what POET does, optical interconnects for 800G, 1.6T speeds and up.

So on October 7th (to-fucking-day) they announced they raised $75M. Biggest investment in their history. But here's the thing... they won't say who gave them the money. Just says ""a single institutional investor"" in the press release. No broker, no finder's fee, straight direct placement.

When I saw that I was like wait what? Companies don't usually hide this shit unless there's a reason. And when you do a direct placement with no intermediaries that usually means you already know each other, like this isn't some random fund that saw your pitch deck.

The timing is what really got my attention though. OpenAI announces that massive AMD deal on October 6th, literally the day before. POET just launched their 1.6T optical receivers with Semtech on Sept 30. They got their first real production order in September for over $500K, yeah I know that's fucking peanuts. Their Malaysia manufacturing facility just came online. Everything is happening right now and then they get a mystery $75M investment.

I started thinking about who needs optical interconnects right now. OpenAI is building out 6 gigawatts with AMD and 10 gigawatts with NVIDIA, they absolutely need this shit. NVIDIA has been throwing billions at AI infrastructure companies but they don't have any optical interconnect plays in their portfolio. Microsoft needs to secure OpenAI's supply chain. Amazon and Google are behind and trying to catch up. Every major player in AI needs what POET makes.

And it's not vaporware, Foxconn selected them for their 800G and 1.6T modules. Semtech co-developed products with them and did a joint announcement. They're shipping samples to three major tech companies right now. Semtech wouldn't put their name on it if it was bullshit.

If someone bought 15% of the company, which is about what $75M gets you at $5.50 per share, they legally have to file with the SEC within 10 days. It's called a 13D or 13G filing. The deadline is October 17th. That filing has to show who they are, how much they bought, whether it's passive or strategic, all of it.

So in 10 days we're going to know if this was NVIDIA, OpenAI, Microsoft, Amazon, whoever. If it's one of them this stock is going to fucking moon because it validates everything. If it's just some random growth fund then whatever. I'm here for the fucking casino.

Now look I'm not an idiot, there's a bear case here. Company has been around since 1972 and they're basically still pre-revenue, they did like $268K last quarter. They've lost $214M over their lifetime. They've raised $227M in the last 2 years alone, constant dilution.

But someone just put $75M directly into this company right as everything is coming together. No intermediaries. Right as production is scaling. Right as OpenAI is making major chip diversification moves. The structure looks exactly like the OpenAI-AMD deal with the warrants out to 2030. Either this is the luckiest timing ever or something's going on.

Position: I like to gamble so I picked up 1,000 $10C 10/31. I'm betting it all on a big partnership.

101,NVDA,DD: why i am all in BITF,"Bitcoin Mining to Gov-Grade AI Cloud?

1. Board Appointment Signals a Pivot

On Aug 18, 2025, Bitfarms appointed Wayne Duso (ex-AWS &amp; Dell) to its Board.

Why this matters: Duso helped scale AWS GovCloud and Dell’s $B+ businesses. His expertise is hyperscale cloud + government compliance (FedRAMP, FISMA, DoD IL5/IL6).

Speculation: Bitfarms may be lining up federal certifications for its Panther Creek (PA) site. These are must-have for handling sensitive workloads like defense AI model training.

Quick primer:

FedRAMP High → secure federal cloud for sensitive but unclassified data.

FISMA High → compliance for “severe consequence” data breaches.

DoD IL5/IL6 → Controlled Unclassified Info (IL5) and Secret (IL6) – critical for DoD AI workloads.

Add Duso’s background → very plausible Bitfarms is positioning Panther Creek for Gov/DoD AI contracts (think AWS-style premium pricing).

2. Revenue Potential – AI Cloud vs. Mining

Industry benchmarks (2025):

AI Data Centers: ~$12.5M/MW gross → ~$5–7M/MW net in PA.

Colocation: ~$1.3–1.5M/MW (TeraWulf).

CoreWeave (PA): ~$6M/MW.

Texas &amp; NY AI Cloud: $4–6M/MW (more volatility + higher energy costs).

Panther Creek specifics:

1 GW potential → scale to 500+ MW.

Nuclear + hydro power at $0.02–0.03/kWh via PJM grid (super cheap).

80% NOI margins if certified + locked with a hyperscaler (Amazon, etc.).

At $5–7M/MW, Panther Creek could generate $2.5–3.5B/year net if 500 MW is deployed.

3. Quebec Pilot – AMD MI300X Advantage

Early 2025, Bitfarms repurposed part of its Saint-Hyacinthe (QC) site (~50 MW) for AMD MI300X racks:

Memory Edge: 192 GB HBM3 vs. H100’s 80 GB → fewer GPUs needed for large models.

Cost: $15–20K vs. $30K+ H100 → ~20–30% lower TCO.

Efficiency: 750W TDP; Quebec pilot hit 85% GPU utilization on vLLM inference.

Software: ROCm 6.0+ now supports PyTorch + Hugging Face.

If scaled at Panther Creek:

Revenue boost → $6–8M/MW (thanks to AMD’s pricing + cheap power).

Quebec tests already yield 2–3x mining margins.

4. Talent &amp; Partners Lining Up

James Bond (yes, real name) hired as SVP of HPC on Mar 26, 2025 → likely behind the Quebec AI pilot.

T5 Data Centers provides lifecycle ops, certifications, and multi-year contracts → exactly the type of partner hyperscalers demand.

Locations = edge:

Pennsylvania: Cheap/stable nuclear, undersea fiber routes to EU/Africa, political support for data centers.

Washington: Hydro &lt; $0.03/kWh, West Coast hub with fiber routes to Asia.

5. The Big Picture

Bitfarms is quietly building an AWS-style AI/GovCloud pivot → with nuclear-backed capacity, AMD MI300X pilots, and GovCloud talent.

If certifications + hyperscaler deal land (Amazon is the obvious candidate), Panther Creek could turn into one of the highest-margin AI data centers in North America.

Bitcoin mining may become the “side hustle”; AI cloud could be the real money printer.


TLDR:

Wayne Duso (ex-AWS GovCloud) joins Bitfarms → signaling FedRAMP/DoD ambitions.

Panther Creek (PA) could net $5–7M/MW/year, scaling to multi-B revenue.

Quebec pilot proves AMD MI300X racks = cheaper, more efficient vs. NVIDIA.

Talent + partners (James Bond, T5 Data Centers) strengthen the case.

Locations in PA + WA give Bitfarms strategic energy + fiber advantages.

Speculation but very plausible: Bitfarms is morphing from BTC miner → AI cloud Gov/DoD player.",249,107,1759191131.0,2025-09-30T00:12:11+00:00,t3_1ntyifa

103,NVDA,YOLOing 50k into The $HI Acquisition Play,"Alright you fellow degenerates and gamblers, gather round. Forget Nvidia AI GPUs for a sec, I found the ultimate boomer stock with the most WSB energy imaginable: **Hillenbrand ($HI)**. Yeah, I know, sounds like a law firm or a casket company. Spoiler: it *was* a casket company. Now it makes boring plastic machines for Nestle and General Mills. Yup, exciting stuff.

So why should you care? Because some **private equity giga-chads (Apollo, Lone Star, Stellex)** are sniffing around like wolves at a nursing home buffet.

Here’s the kicker:

* EBITDA = \~$418M
* Normal boring industrial buyouts go for \~9–10× EBITDA
* Do the math: that’s a buyout price of \~$3.7–$4.0B EV → translates to about **$33–$36 per share**.
* Stock is sitting at $26.6. Bruh.

Now the fun part. Some **smart money lad yeeted $1.5M+ into $HI $30 calls expiring in November** right before close on Friday.

So we’ve got:

* Real buyers (Apollo don’t mess around).
* Real EBITDA math saying $33–36/share is the sweet spot.
* A PE bidding war.
* A random whale throwing $1.5M into illiquid calls like it’s a DraftKings parlay.

My dumb brain translation: either this dies in a ditch and we all lose money, or we get the juiciest $7–10/share tendie pop when a deal hits. My guess? **70% chance this goes through, 30% chance we’re bagholders crying into our Costco caskets**

So obivously, I YOLO'ed 50k into it. If you want exposure to *actual* smart money degeneracy instead of lotto scratchers on SPY weeklies, $HI might be the boomer rocket you never expected.

Based on my analysis target price: **$33–36**.  
Expiration date: **hopefully before our (at least mine) contracts do.**

TL;DR This company was killing it before tariff, still making a lot of things, all in the US of A. There's a bidding war and company will be acquired, I expect 7-8x EBITDA, so based on some sophisticated advanced complicated math, I think stocks will be at least $33 once it's announced or goes through. So...

106,NVDA,Single Cell Analyst couldn't be more wrong about INTEL and AI,"# Single Cell Analysts and Investors are fucking wrong, and NVIDIA interest in INTEL proves it

AI runs on GPUs, right? RIGHT?

The answer is it depends. And most people (including developers) don't know that, but they will know, eventually

Let's begin with memory bandwidth from now on BW

Each token generation requires accessing ALL model weights, that means for each output token you need to load the entire model so how fast you load that model in memory, for that bw was the major limitation of CPUs ultill the next gen

The current top xeon has 0.614TB/s which is a ton, and could be working on dual configuration with 6TB RAM at 1,7TB/s but Top GPUs like A100 have 2TB/s and H100 has 3TB/s, the next generation of Intel Xeon 18A is expected to have \~2TB/s. Positioning near A100.

BW tl;dr: \*\*Usually doubling bandwidth roughly doubles token generation speed  
BW deepdive:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1brcnps/is\_inferencing\_memory\_bandwidth\_limited/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1brcnps/is_inferencing_memory_bandwidth_limited/)



Let's keep going, usually big chunk papa models cannot and will not work on a CPU period, but advances in quantization(from now on Q\_) made possible to run big papa models like gpt-oss 120b run on a CPU with a loss in accuracy near to 2%

Usually models are based on 16B and Q\_ down to 8 or 4, each time you half the number of bits, it halves the model size. For example GPT-OSS could run Q\_8 with only 60GB what makes possible to run at any modern workstation CPU RAM. You have 2 modules of 32GB DDR5? Boom you can run Q\_ big papa models

Q\_ tl;dr: CPUs can run big models on RAM now

Q\_ deepdive: [https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/optimizing-llms-for-performance-and-accuracy-with-post-training-quantization/](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/optimizing-llms-for-performance-and-accuracy-with-post-training-quantization/)

[https:\/\/developer.nvidia.com\/blog\/optimizing-llms-for-performance-and-accuracy-with-post-training-quantization\/](https://preview.redd.it/xjqr7wqojcrf1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b50372aec5d17a684cfa3882534067d4bd58844)

Let's talk about money, while a GPU is the king and surpasses the CPU in every metric possible, CPUs are crazy energy efficient and versatile, but what does it mean? It means that server providers are more prone to buy a CPU because they have a wider set of applications, and not only inference so they can have less idle time and more money back from their chips, since we discussed earlier, not everyone needs the biggest model available and token generation speed in new Xeon processors with CPU tokens per second sucks vs GPU they are not even close, but! Look at performance:

[https:\/\/www.nscale.com\/blog\/cpu-inferencing-why-not](https://preview.redd.it/8h79t8kqjcrf1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e3f3f23a5491adf4064be81e5af3be9a53dd86c)

Oh boy, you can bet small to mid-sized businesses are going to notice this, since this graph is not suitable for large environments where inference is handled by a cluster using vLLM or other software that allows load distribution and pipeline parallelism.

And they are not only crazy efficient but Intel is positioning at the most competitive chips for LLM inference per dollar:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1jxwk05/intel\_6944p\_the\_most\_cost\_effective\_cpu\_solution/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1jxwk05/intel_6944p_the_most_cost_effective_cpu_solution/)

Lastly, the necessity of private LLM execution for small and mid-sized businesses is a niche that perfectly meets CPU inference.

[https://openmetal.io/resources/blog/private-ai-cpu-vs-gpu-inference/](https://openmetal.io/resources/blog/private-ai-cpu-vs-gpu-inference/)

On top of all of this, Intel and NVIDIA reached an agreement which announcement literally says: ""For data centers, Intel will build NVIDIA-custom x86 CPUs that NVIDIA will integrate into its AI infrastructure platforms and offer to the market.""  
[https://newsroom.intel.com/artificial-intelligence/intel-and-nvidia-to-jointly-develop-ai-infrastructure-and-personal-computing-products](https://newsroom.intel.com/artificial-intelligence/intel-and-nvidia-to-jointly-develop-ai-infrastructure-and-personal-computing-products)  
So you can bet every board in a data center that works with Nvidia will have an Intel-manufactured CPU, which means that NVIDIA could be one of the first clients of the new Foundries that could be followed by other manufacturers and fabless chip designers.

tl;dr: buy intel

107,NVDA,NVTS Navitas Semiconductor Run Incoming (NVDA Blackwell),"I’m picking NVTS for AI and Data Center Expansion. Basically this is a company specializing in next-generation power semiconductors, including gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC) technologies. These are used in high-growth areas like AI data centers, electric vehicles (EVs), mobile charging, and renewable energy.

•  NVTS eyeing revival through NVIDIA AI synergies—volume’s solid, but P/E flags caution. Buybacks could turbocharge if fundamentals align; divested $100M+ last year signals pivot potential.

•  Risk-reward tightening.. Upside from scale-ups and partnerships; downside on costs/delays.

•  Pre-market buzz tied to EV/AI tailwinds—partnership expansions and earnings guidance in focus.

•  Shares breaking 50-day MA on volume—technical setup for extension if momentum holds.

•  Despite revenue dip, EV/semi growth narrative intact—optimism hinges on delivery.

Not financial advice, DYOR, but if AI infrastructure bottlenecks persist (hello, NVIDIA Blackwell), NVTS could be the under-the-radar winner. At the current price, I’d say the room to run is to $16 after $9 breaks. We saw this on APLD. This narrative is the play.

Q3 earnings Nov 3 could spotlight AI progress; ECCE and WiPDA conferences in Oct/Nov for tech showcases; CES 2026 prep might drop EV bombshells via VREMT.

\[FINAL UPDATE: Sold out for \~5% profit after 8 days\]

Options were kinda expensive on this one so I didn't think they were underpriced. Being said - lots of shit / potential catalysts around this one that I am unsure if market has priced in yet. Look at all NVDA's recent partnerships (OpenAI in particular - I'm looking at you). I believe micron provides the memory for nvidia GPU's and it may have potential to go brr. Dunno - it's an ER play. I actually don't really know what these guys do to be honest, just lots of chatter &amp; I blindly trusted chat. I'm likely rotating out of micron within a week. These were bought this morning as I rotated out of $SNAP calls. I didn't like how options were priced on this one so monkeyed into shares instead.

It's already ran 40% last month, so high risk. I love buying the top.

Goodluck to all in the cino

\[Update\] Literally flat. Boring. My call about options being overpriced was correct, these are up \~0.5% if AH holds tomorrow. Glad I bought shares &amp; didn't play options here. Theta gang printing tho. I'm up like 5-10k on the AH movement. Theta gang &amp; shares won this one.

\[Update 2\] Might make like 1.5-2% on these tomorrow. Seems to be trending upwards. Lots of people bullish in the other threads - suggesting a hold is an alright bet. My read about overpriced vol seems to be correct tho - options are not the play on this one. I'll update chat when I exit. Goodluck to all.

114,NVDA,Huge Micron Bet,"Hey everyone,

First time with a DD so forgive me if I sound regarded. 

This is the biggest trade I am set up for and wanted to share my thoughts. 

I believe we are going to see a huge run up next Tuesday with Microns earnings call. Current price is $162 with the pull back with Samsungs announcement spooking the market but I believe this won’t affect Microns future capabilities with HBM.  

So Micron Q4 earnings are coming up… and I’m bullish. I took up a huge position with the underlying prior to the pump on Thursday. 

Yesterday with the drop I loaded up at the bottom on 200 calls $175 expiring October 17. 

My logic is this. 

Seeing what happened with Oracle over their guidance gives me confident we may expect something crazy from Micron, especially when their customers Nvidia, Amd, Microsoft, Amazon, Google all had record years. All of them just crushed it on AI and cloud growth.

If they’re winning, Micron is too. Every GPU and every data center relies on Micron’s memory to run. While there are 2 main competitors in the memory landscape (Samsung and SK Hynix) I believe Micron is well positioned regardless. 

Last quarter: $9.3B in revenue with nearly 50% growth in high-bandwidth memory sales.

Next up: Management is guiding ~$10.7B for Q4 with stronger margins. I think they may beat expectations. 

In all of the last 5 reported fiscal quarters listed above, Micron has beaten EPS expectations.  ￼

The beat amounts range from ~+$0.13 to ~+$0.34 in recent quarters.

The most recent (Q3 FY2025) was the largest beat in that sample, +$0.34

However with this upcoming Q4 FY 2025, EPS consensus estimates are around $2.78-$2.86 per share. Year-over-year that’s a big jump from ~$1.18 in Q4 FY2024.  ￼
	
Gross margin expectations have been revised up, reflecting tight supply + improved pricing (especially DRAM).

Analyst Quotes &amp; Price Targets

Wedbush (Matt Bryson) – PT $200

Micron Management Quotes &amp; Context

“Micron’s strong competitive position and solid execution delivered record revenue in fiscal Q3, with revenue, gross margin and EPS all exceeding the high end of our guidance ranges.” — Sanjay Mehrotra, CEO.  ￼

“Data center revenue more than doubled year over year and reached a record level, and consumer-oriented markets had strong sequential growth.” — Mehrotra.  ￼
	
“We generated substantial free cash flow in the quarter, even as we continue to make strategic investments critical to sustain long term growth.” — Mehrotra.  ￼
	
“Micron delivered record revenue in fiscal Q3, driven by all-time-high DRAM revenue including nearly 50% sequential growth in HBM revenue.” — Mehrotra.  ￼

“We are on track to deliver record revenue with solid profitability and free cash flow in fiscal 2025, while we invest to build on our leadership to address growing AI-driven memory demand.” — Mehrotra.  ￼

“Fiscal Q3 DRAM revenue was $7.1 billion, up 51% year over year, and represented 76% of total revenue. Sequentially, DRAM revenue increased 15%, with bit shipments increasing over 20% and prices decreasing in the low single-digit percentage range, primarily due to a higher consumer-oriented revenue mix.” — Mark Murphy, CFO.  ￼

“NAND revenue was $2.2 billion … Sequentially, NAND revenue increased 16%, with bit shipments increasing in the mid-20s percentage range and prices decreasing in the high single-digit percentage range.” — Murphy.  ￼

“Gross margin … was above the high end of our guidance range, primarily due to better prices for both DRAM and NAND, partially offset by a higher consumer-oriented mix.” — CFO Murphy.  ￼
	
“Ending inventory for fiscal Q3 was $8.7 billion, or 139 days. Inventory was down $280 million sequentially, and inventory days were down 19 days sequentially, driven by strong sequential bit shipment growth in both DRAM and NAND.” — Murphy.  ￼
	
Guidance for Q4:
“We expect revenue of $10.7 billion ± $300 million; gross margin non-GAAP of ~42% ± 1%; operating expenses approx $1.2 billion ± $20 million; non-GAAP EPS of ~$2.50 ± $0.15 per share.” — Micron management.  ￼

“With another quarter of shipment growth forecasted in fiscal Q4, we expect to exit fiscal 2025 with tight DRAM inventories, significantly reduced NAND inventories and overall company DIO near our target levels. With low inventories on hand and a constructive demand environment, we will continue to focus on improving pricing and further strengthening our product mix.” — Management.  ￼

TLDR

Best Case (Bullish)

Revenue: ~$11.2B+ (above top of guidance)

EPS: $2.90+ (beats revised $2.85 guide)

Gross Margin: 45%+ (tight supply + strong DRAM/HBM pricing)

Guidance: Raised again for FY2026, pointing to sustained AI/cloud demand
	
Stock Impact: Could rally +20–30%, pushing toward $180–$200 as analysts hike targets

Worst Case (Bearish)

Revenue: &lt; $11.0B (below guide midpoint)

EPS: &lt; $2.70 (miss vs Street ~$2.78–$2.85)

Margins: Slip toward 42–43% (pricing softness, higher costs)

Guidance: Conservative, signaling slower demand or inventory concerns

Stock Impact: Could drop −10–25%, retracing toward $120–$130

The biggest risk I see is the cyclical narrative but given the demand this year and how we are seeing AI and data centers scaling up, I think we have reached a point where the market transitions from cyclical to more secular. 

Right now PE is ~24-25 with the drop but if EPS expectation is hit $10-12 for FY 2026, and PE drops to 18-20 we are still looking at $200+ price target. I believe $175-185 is a lower range.

Of course this all depends on how Micron Management forward guidance looks but I think we are in for a surprise.

118,NVDA,HUGE Deal Between $INTC and $NVDA,"NVIDIA and Intel announced a multi-generation collaboration across PC and datacenter and NVIDIA will invest $5B in Intel at $23.28 per share. The joint solution will be a tight coupling Intel x86 CPUs and NVIDIA RTX GPUs over NVLink for PCs and data-center platforms. Timeframe are TBD and current roadmaps with arm will not change, per sources, meaning NVIDIA will offer both.
 
Overall
 
•PCs: Intel will build and sell x86 SoCs integrating NVIDIA RTX GPU chiplets
•Data center: Intel will build NVIDIA-custom x86 CPUs that NVIDIA integrates into its AI platforms
•Financial: NVIDIA is committing $5B to Intel equity at $23.28/share
•Scope: Product collaboration—not a foundry manufacturing deal
 
Why it matters
 
•Windows/x86 PCs: Higher-bandwidth, lower-latency CPU-GPU coupling should lift AI inference and pro-app and gaming performance versus discrete PCIe designs. Data center: NVIDIA gains an x86 option alongside ARM; Intel attaches CPUs into NVIDIA’s fastest-growing AI platforms.
 
What we don’t know yet
 
•Ship timing, ramp cadence, and how many generations.
•NVLink specifics (bandwidth, flavor, coherence) and CPU-DRAM/GPU-HBM memory topology.
•Process nodes and packaging (EMIB/Foveros) for the PC SoC and the custom DC CPU.
•PC SoC scope (NPU, power targets, die/chiplet counts) and NVIDIA rack-level designs.
•Software stack details (CUDA/driver model on Windows/x86; Linux support).
•Commercial mechanics of RTX chiplets inside an Intel-sold SoC and CPU attach accounting on NVIDIA platforms",1367,205,1758193818.0,2025-09-18T11:10:18+00:00,t3_1nk5cl8

125,NVDA,"$GLXY $CRWV- A massive deal for StarGate between CoreWeave, Galaxy and a Hyperscaler - Additional New 2.7 GigaWatts of Power Unaccounted For","StarGate is here and one does not just bring on GigaWatts of power to a building without massive expertise, knowhow, land rights and government help for expediency on permitting. I have no idea on the timing of this but the tea leaves are all right in front of us.

**TL;DR:** I believe a massive new deal is brewing for Giga-Scale AI Factory capacity between CoreWeave, Galaxy, and an AI HyperScaler. New Government regulations are lightspeeding the permitting process and allowing companies to start building while air permits are being obtained. This should lead to new massive deals sooner in the near term rather than later. Even if the projects are years out. Giga-Scale powered AI Factories are here and the opportunity has never been better for companies like Galaxy. The providers (OpenAI, MSFT, Google, AWS) don't want to be landlords or data center builders and the data center builders don't want to be landlords-This is where Galaxy fits in.

First, who the hell is Galaxy and why are they important? Turns out, they are an up and coming Crypto (we have lots of space and power) to AI infrastructure play based out of Alfont, Texas.

Specifically, Helios is the is the campus where they have initial power and upcoming powered AI shells and newly closed land deals and power requests that are reportedly bringing **an additional 2.7 Gigawatts of fully functional powered AI GPU data center shells**.

To note, Oracle just closed a $300 Billion deal with OpenAI that is tied to StarGate and the quick notes on that are

* 4.5 GigaWatts of power
* Scheduled for first delivery by 2027\*
* $300 Billion contract over 5 years

Again, nobody just has GigaWatts of power on the US grid. It is rare earth mineral levels of concern right now. There is so much work and permitting on that amount of power scale that the government had to issue new executive orders to try and help expedite the process.

For Oracle they have about \~$10 Billion in cash and they are [reportedly (Bloomberg) preparing a $38 Billion debt package from various banks](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-04/banks-ready-38-billion-of-debt-for-data-centers-tied-to-oracle). Roughly to get 4.5 GigaWatts of power is going to cost you about $38+($32B - $60B) Billion and yield you $300 Billion over 5 years... Not bad. And it gives us a baseline of how to think about this. **\*Note this figure does not include Nvidia GPUS.** That's extra.

For Galaxy, they are already starting this process of bringing on massive new power for land acquisitions now giving them over 1500 sq acres of land in Texas with clearly the ability to add on more throughout the years even over the current amount. Literally, this is big new oil in the making right there in big ole Texas.

Here's the kicker, CoreWeave has been buying all (100%) of their announced and soon to be ready power for their initial phases I,II,III of totalled 800 MW of active compute power.

Just take a look of all the deals and power CoreWeave has committed to and it's not just partial. It's ALL OF IT.

3. **Update on expansion pipeline:** By **Aug 15, 2025**, Galaxy says it has **2.7 GW of additional power capacity under various stages of load study**, with **potential to 3.5 GW** at full build-out; this is separate from (and **in addition to**) the 800 MW already contracted to CoreWeave.

4. **New land + 1 GW interconnect request:** In the **Q2’25 earnings call**, Galaxy said it entered a **PSA for 160 acres** and submitted a **1 GW load interconnection request** adjacent to Helios (this 1 GW is part of the broader “under study” pool). [Q4 CDN](https://s201.q4cdn.com/407453138/files/doc_financials/2025/q2/Galaxy-Digital-Inc-2Q25-Earnings-Transcript.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

The question becomes - Who is committing to that additional 2.7 GigaWatts of power?

And it's not just in Galaxies thoughts and ideas. They recently closed on land adjacent to Helios in 2024 of 160 acres and very recently an agreement mentioned in their Q2 earnings call alluded to another 160 acres is now a done deal. So from their Q2 we have an agreement to the now signed and recorded deed this is a very real acquisition and commitment for Galaxy. Especially, the 1 GW power interconnect request that came with the property.

https://preview.redd.it/y505m06zejof1.png?width=2305&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb8458d05d64a8369fd23786ab928b606ac02c26

Both of these deeds are from 2025 and are for the plots below in the large red square with green circles 33, 39 and I believe 37 give a total of another 160 acres. Everything that is highlighted or squared below is what Galaxy owns. The current Helios setup and committed 800 MW of active power is in the yellow square.

https://preview.redd.it/c14simu1fjof1.png?width=1248&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae1daeb6417548f90ef3474d5c99f17c95171cce

Even the neighboring plots are just a bunch of old people selling farmland. So the question becomes. Who is Galaxy building all of that active powered AI ready shells for? Again, at every turn CoreWeave has been the one to buy up the leases at a 15 year commit.

Now, if you remember there are additional tea leaves to follow here too. In the Q2 call Michael and team alluded to another extension that would be realized in Q3. We haven't heard about that as of yet. That is still a major Q3 catalyst we are all waiting for.

What we also know is that yesterday at the Goldman Sachs conference call the CoreWeave team was asked a question, ""are there or do you see any more multi-billion dollar deals being done?"" How CoreWeave replied was telling, they neither confirmed nor denied but what they did say is this.

* What they are seeing now is an inflection point in demand.
* Customers are coming to them for longer contracts (extended time periods)
* And customers are requesting the very highest end GPU's which are currently the GB Ultra 300's NVL72 racks.
* **We talked to insiders and even the NBIS deal as large as it is still doesn't fix the problem - They need still need more**
* **There is an insatiable demand for AI**

To me, what this is all saying is that reasoning models are burning through GPU's. Empirically I know this to be true but the comment from CoreWeave just outright confirms this. And to that point the very next hours of yesterday during Oracle's earnings call they reported a massive 300B data center deal and need.

So right there, only hours later another major multi-billion dollar deal was being done.

And Michael alluded to that whatever the NBIS deal is that still isn't enough. But why? Reasoning models while so much better than before they are slower than hell at returning an answer. Sam Altman literally said, ""we have even way larger and better models but we don't have the capacity (GPU'S) to give them to you.""

Tracking it all, there is still an insatiable demand and obvious capacity constraints.

Again, what is Galaxy doing buying all this land and land studying 2.7 GigaWatts of additional power for? To me, that has to be some NDA'd customer that is committing to that data center scale. So, why not CoreWeave? They are already a preferred customer and have commited to 800 MW already from Galaxy.

And it gets even better.

Remember that the US power grid is so strained right now anyone gaining access to it is basically given contract. Literally, that is the Vineland NJ deal for NBIS and Microsoft. The initial deal from MSFT is you have 200 MW - 300 MW of power coming online, ""We'll take that right now."" No questions asked.

What if at some milestone i.e. permit checkmark or otherwise Galaxy says we are ready to establish Phase 4, 5, 6, 7 to commit/contract out? That I know is going to occur but the only real question I have is how fast can that unbeknownst to me milestone occur to give an official deal channel from CoreWeave with Galaxy and thus CoreWeave to Hyperscaler?

Well, if you remember, President Trump and the EPA now have an official fast track AI infrastructure plan which is to remove hurdles and obstacles to get AI powered shells up and going as fast as possible. That's net new from just a couple months ago.

The largest benefit that will shave off 18-30 months of a normal project is letting the landlord build first without have any emissions and working in parrell for the other land and water regulations that have to occur whilst trying to fast track those parts and pieces too.

**Current Understanding of New EPA Rules**

* **Executive Order is in force.** EO **14318** “Accelerating Federal Permitting of Data Center Infrastructure” was signed **July 23, 2025** and published in the Federal Register **July 28, 2025**. It directs agencies to use FAST-41, NEPA categorical exclusions, and other shortcuts for large (100 MW+) AI data centers and their power infrastructure. [The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/07/accelerating-federal-permitting-of-data-center-infrastructure/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **EPA has announced rulemaking (proposed).** On **Sept 9, 2025**, EPA said it will revise the “**Begin Actual Construction**” definition under Clean Air Act NSR so **non-emitting work can start before air permits are issued**; formal rule text isn’t final yet. [US EPA](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-announces-permitting-reform-provide-clarity-expedite-construction-essential-power?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **FAST-41 dashboard exists but no AI data centers listed yet.** The Permitting Council’s dashboard shows covered/transparency projects; as of today there’s **no clearly labeled AI data center project** posted. (Categories are public, but specific AI DC entries aren’t there yet.) [Performance.gov Permitting Council](https://www.permits.performance.gov/projects/fast-41-covered?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

The update of you can begin construction now before needing the Clean Air Act NSR air permits are needed to begin non-emitting work. That's massive. I believe this could usher in commitments and deal sign-offs a lot sooner.

You show the hyperscaler you have a powered shell commit and they are ready to contract up; right way. For these reasons I believe we may get a massive new deal in the range of $22 - $50 Billion dollars to assure that whatever capacity Galaxy and CoreWeave yield is committed to throughout a longer 7 - 10 year capacity commitment.

This is the only thing that makes sense for what Galaxy is doing. Of course I could be wrong or my timeline could be way off so we shall see.

Here is Helios in 2024

https://preview.redd.it/1xnbc7o6fjof1.png?width=1491&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e0cc8822e2da508d1f6f22ff0731f17439bf719

If this looks crude and unorganized but effective that's because it is. This is mostly the power Galaxy's Helios had up and running for coin mining operations converted now over for the AI new big oil gold rush.

Interestingly Nvidia (NVDA) has released a new blog post on September 9th 2025 giving reference designs for what Giga-Scale AI Factories should look like and as you see the comparison they are nothing what the current Helios design looks like today.

[NVIDIA Partners With AI Infrastructure Ecosystem to Unveil Reference Design for Giga-Scale AI Factories](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ai-factories-reference-design/)

At the AI Infrastructure Summit, NVIDIA’s Ian Buck introduces a reference design and partner-driven strategy to transform global infrastructure for high-performance, energy-efficient AI.

Data center Giga-Scale factories are here and Galaxy has a front row seat to massive income and incoming AI capex. Hyperscalers are paying out huge amounts of cash to anyone and everyone who can procure massive amounts of power. Galaxy is actively doing just this.

**My current positions:** I've opened a small position in GLXY and will be adding more Today!

127,NVDA,Why would hyperscalers spend so much with $ORCL instead of just spending themselves?,"UPDATE: It's apparently$300B just from OpeniAI. So yeah, like I hypothesized, the hyperscalers don't need shit from Oracle and there is a high chance most of this doesn't happen. OpenAI can't afford $300B.

I don't get it. They say they got $400B in backlogs from only a few customers, which means like $100B+ per customer. Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta, Google, Amazon...

There are a handful of companies on the entire planet which that describes, and they can build their own stuff. Why, for example, would Meta or Amazon give Oracle $50B just to build a data center that doesn't even exist yet anyway?

It's one thing to buy infrastructure that already exists and that you want right now, it's another thing to order infrastructure that doesn't even exist when you already know how to build your own.

The whole cloud revenue/order backlog thing looks like bullshit to me. It's going to grow $144B in cloud revenue in 5 years? Uh, I don't see Google, Microsoft, or Amazon doubling cloud revenue every year, so how the fuck is Oracle?

128,NVDA,$160k YOLO into $MU Micron because memory go BOOM. Up $90k so far.,"I dumped my entire 401k into OTM LEAPS on $MU when they reported their 2025 Q3 earnings. They had a double beat and raised guidance yet the stock fell 20%. HBM is the second biggest bottleneck for AI infrastructure, behind COWOS packaging. HBM unit sales are expected to grow 15x by 2035. ASP will continue to go up as each new HBM generation production comes available. SK Hynix has already reported they will be increasing ASP for their HBM4 by 70% vs HBM3E. HBM is also the highest margin part of the business.

Nvidia is innovating their compute power per chip by 100%-200% every 2 years but memory makers are only innovating at a rate of 50%-100% every 2 years. So each GPU, TPU, XPU will require more and more HBM stacks per chip. Also, as HBM continues to innovate, each generation requires more space on the wafer so less chips/wafer, the complexity gets harder and harder, and the yield takes longer and longer to ramp.

Micron is aggressively taking market share from Samsung and it is the only DRAM maker headquartered in the US. Micron also claims it's HBM stack is 30% more power effective than the competition. Looking at valuations, Micron is still priced as a cyclical stock but is starting to transition into a secular stock.

131,NVDA,"Nvidia’s top 2 mystery customers made 39% of Q2 revenue, up from 25% last year, raising concentration risk concerns","No paywall: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/28/nvidias-top-two-mystery-customers-made-up-39percent-of-its-q2-revenue-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/28/nvidias-top-two-mystery-customers-made-up-39percent-of-its-q2-revenue-.html)

Two Nvidia customers made up 39% of Nvidia’s revenue in its July quarter, the company revealed in a financial filing on Wednesday, raising concerns about the concentration of the chipmaker’s clientele.

“Customer A” made up 23% of total revenue, and “Customer B” comprised 16% of total revenue, according to the company’s second-quarter filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

That’s higher than the same quarter a year ago when Nvidia’s top two customers made up 14% and 11% of sales, according to the filing.

The company regularly publishes information on a quarterly basis about its top customers, but the disclosure this week is fueling a renewed debate about whether Nvidia’s explosive growth is being driven by a handful of large cloud providers such as Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Oracle.

Nvidia finance chief Colette Kress said in a Wednesday statement that “large cloud service providers” made up about 50% of the company’s data center revenue. That’s important as the data center business made up 88% of Nvidia’s overall revenue in the second quarter.

“We have experienced periods where we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers, and this trend may continue,” Nvidia wrote in the filing.

Increasingly, analysts are looking to those cloud capital expenditure spending commitments to model the future growth of Nvidia.

“We see limited room for further earnings upside revision or share price catalyst in the near-term unless we have increasing clarity over upside in 2026 \[cloud service provider\] capex expectations,” wrote HSBC analyst Frank Lee in a note on Thursday. He has a hold rating on the stock.

But Nvidia’s Customer A and Customer B are not necessarily cloud providers. It’s a bit of a mystery, and an Nvidia representative declined to share the identities of Customer A and Customer B.

In its filing, Nvidia says it has both “direct customers” and “indirect customers.” Customer A and Customer B are listed as “direct customers.”

Direct customers are not the end users of Nvidia’s chips. They’re companies that buy the chips to build into complete systems or circuit boards that they then sell to data centers, cloud providers and end-users. Some of these direct customers are original design manufacturers or original equipment manufacturers like Foxconn or Quanta. Others are distributors or system integrators like Dell.

Indirect customers, meanwhile, include cloud service providers, internet companies and enterprises, which typically buy systems from Nvidia’s direct customers. Nvidia says it can only estimate revenue to indirect customers based on purchase orders and internal sales data.

Deciphering if any of those cloud providers are Nvidia’s mystery customers is difficult, in part because the chipmaker has wiggle room in the definitions of its direct and indirect customers.

Nvidia, for example, wrote in the filing that some direct customers buy chips to build systems for their own use.

Additionally, Nvidia noted that two of its indirect customers each accounted for over 10% of its total revenue, primarily buying systems through Customers A and B.

Contributing further to the mystery of it all, Nvidia said that an “AI research and development company” contributed a “meaningful” amount of revenue through both direct and indirect customers.

Nvidia told investors on Wednesday that demand for the company’s AI systems remains high, not just among cloud providers, but among other kinds of customers, including enterprises buying systems for AI and “neoclouds,” which are companies that are taking on the biggest providers with services more tuned for AI. Nvidia also listed foreign governments, saying it would record $20 billion in revenue this year for “sovereign AI.” All of these product categories are contributing to Nvidia’s revenue growth, Kress told analysts on an earnings call.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang also said that the company has a new forecast of $3 to $4 trillion in AI infrastructure by the end of the decade. It said that it could take about 70% of the total cost of a $50 billion AI-focused data center, not just for its graphics processing units but for other chips it sells, too.

Huang told investors it was a sensible target for the next five years because of how much hyperscalers were spending and committing to spend — $600 billion this year, according to Huang. He also said new kinds of customers, such as enterprises or overseas cloud providers, were joining the build-out.

“As you know, the capex of just the top four hyperscalers has doubled in two years as the AI revolution went into full steam,” Huang said.",1626,258,1756652296.0,2025-08-31T14:58:16+00:00,t3_1n4wvy8

134,NVDA,Alibaba unveils homegrown AI chip to replace Nvidia’s H20 in China,"No paywall: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chinas-alibaba-develops-ai-chip-090846681.html

(Reuters) -China's Alibaba has developed a new chip that is more versatile than its older chips and is meant to serve a broader range of AI inference tasks, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The chip, now in testing, is manufactured by a Chinese company, in contrast to an earlier Alibaba AI processor that was fabricated by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, the report said.

Alibaba did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Chinese tech and AI companies have been focusing heavily on homegrown technology at a time when leading AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) has faced regulatory issues in selling its products in the country.

Nvidia's H20 chip, the most powerful AI processor it is allowed to sell in China, was effectively blocked from sale in the market earlier this year by the Trump administration.

While the U.S. last month allowed Nvidia to resume sales of H20 to China, Chinese firms have been working on processors that could substitute H20. Beijing has also put pressure on tech giants, including Alibaba and ByteDance, over purchases of the H20 chip.

Nvidia developed the H20 specifically for China following U.S. export restrictions on its other AI processors in 2023. The H20 does not have as much computing power as Nvidia's H100 or its Blackwell series.

Alibaba is China's biggest cloud-computing company and is among the top customers of Nvidia.

Separately, on Friday, the company reported a 26% jump in revenue in its cloud computing segment for the April-June quarter, beating market estimates, on the back of solid demand.",1825,387,1756467392.0,2025-08-29T11:36:32+00:00,t3_1n350ak

137,NVDA,CRWV BULLISH DD,"Alright listen up you red crayon eaters. Because it is time to turn your -90% portfolios to +400%.

CoreWeave has been bashed in recent times due to mounting debts. But not many billionaires would advise you to keep emergency cash in fact, borrowing is the meta to becoming rich. The printer never stops, you just need to outgrow inflation and grab all that newly minted benjamins. If CoreWeave was a soy boy, they'd be delisted in 2 years. To win, you need to take risks, and CoreWeave has done exactly that.

Sure their business model is absolutely asset intensive but 99% of men love assets. But enough yappers. Because I will show you some calculations on the breakdown on their CAPEX, and estimated OPEX.

Before we begin, as with most bullshit corporate documents, I will outline assumptions based on Gemini-able, GPT-able, GROX-able information. We will be assuming land cost, PUE, construction costs, and IT costs in estimates. Utility prices will be taken off latest available information off the net.

CoreWeave has reported that they are on track to deliver up to 900MW in their 2025 guidance. This is almost double their current active capacity, sitting at 470MW. But oh boy those datacenters they are gonna erect will give many Wallstreet Buffets wannabe ED. Sure, datacenters are expensive but the premium of these bad boy Grace and Blackwell supercomputers can command gives me viagra on crack and Redbull. The following calculations are all based in USD.

**First up CAPEX (on 430MW)**

Hard Construction Costs: $18M per Megawatt  
Soft Construction Costs: 20% of Hard Construction Costs  
Land Required/MW: \~550m^(2) (5,920ft^(2) for retards)  
Land Cost/m^(2) : $20  
Jensen Baby Cost per GB300 NVL72: \~$3M (each takes up 130kW)  
Assume 80% Fit-out of GB300 NVL72: 2,646 GB300 NVL72s = $7,939M  
Other supporting racks/IT (20% fit-out): $5M/MW = $430M

**Total CAPEX = $7,939M + $430M + $4.73M + $7,740M + $1,548M = $17,661.73M**

**Next up OPEX (on 430MW)**

Total IT Power = 430MW  
Assumed PUE = 1.2  
Total Power Consumption = 516MW  
Commercial Power Price = $0.1185/kWh  
Total Cost for Energy = $535.64M/year

Estimated Water Consumption = 2m^(3)/hour/MW  
Commercial Water Price = $6/m^(3)  
Total Price of Water = $45.21M/year

Asset Maintenance for IT (including depreciation): 5% of IT Cost/year  
Total Maintenance cost for IT = $418.45M/year  
Asset Maintenance for Electrical Systems: 3% of System Cost/year (41% of Construction Cost)  
Total Maintenance cost for Electrical Systems = $95.20M/year  
Asset Maintenance for Mechanical Systems: 4% of System Cost/year (25% of Construction Cost)  
Total Maintenance cost for Electrical Systems = $77.40M/year

Headcount: estimated 806, prorated  
Estimated average payroll/head: $150,000  
Total payroll: $120.9M/ year

**Total Annual OPEX = $535.64M + $45.21M + $418.45M + $95.20M + $77.40M + $120.9M = $1292.80M (excl interest expenses and depreciation)**

Considering CRWV announced capital expenditure of $20 \~ $23 billion, probably likely includes financing leases and acquisition of Core Scientific. But what the hell do they mean?

Based on earlier Q2 earnings suggests, the revenue per Megawatt is \~$11M. If we scale that up without considering any premium for the GB200/GB300, the revenue for just this 430MW is \~$4.73B, logically speaking, we might be looking at almost $5.4B instead.

Tech refresh cycles that is gonna be 3/4 years for these chips, that's fair. But these chips don't just go obsolete / worthless because some accountant deems their ""useful"" life a certain number of years. They can be repurposed, if they retain even 30% of their value in 3 years, the ROI will look even better, and eventually, D&amp;A becomes very misleading and conservative. The buildings and infrastructure are good for 10, 20 years so retrofitting them at fraction of the initial construction costs to suit future needs.

Considering EBITDA, the ROI is as low as 4.4 years, and based on GAAP, the ROI could be 10 years (4 years cycle). And if we consider 30% resale value of these chips at end of 4 years, the ROI can be 8.7 years.

Currently, the FY25 guidance are reporting a mix of Hopper racks and maybe just a quarter of GB200/GB300. As CRWV gain more contracts using GB200 &amp; GB300, and if they can grab and monopolize much of the available Blackwell chips, CRWV can command a higher premium. NVDA's stake in CRWV allows them to get priority access to latest chips, and they are very likely to be first to deploy the Vera Rubin slated to launch in 2026.

The whole AI shenanigans is still at the infant stages, all these large language models is really just the beginning. CRWV having 2.2GW of contracted capacity after acquiring Core Scientific is a calculated and strategic step to ensure they have room to grow at the pace they want to meet the demand they see.

Please do fact check my numbers if you have actual industry knowledge in the US, but they should be in the higher range. I highly believe actual numbers are even more optimistic.

**TLDR:** CoreWeave is basically lighting money on fire today so it can sell compute at premium tomorrow. Their $20–23B capex plan is insane scale, but it checks out: racks of $3M GB200/GB300, $18M/MW concrete palaces, and power bills that could run a small country.

Yes, depreciation nukes GAAP, but that’s just accounting cosplay — the GPUs don’t turn to dust after 3 years, they still earn or can be resold. Interest costs are a real drag, but adjusted EBITDA margins (\~60%+) show the core biz is printing.

The risk? Expansion outpaces demand or tech cycles compress faster than resale value. The upside? CRWV has Nvidia’s golden ticket, first dibs on new silicon, and 2.2GW of contracted capacity locked. Revenue will double, as a low hanging fruit next year.

143,NVDA,I have strong belief that grandma's intel investment would have made sense if Grandma lived a bit longer and timed the market better.,":

EDIT : Forgot to mention that options are dirt cheap.  
EDIT 2 : Just to make it clear, the title is about that guy who invested a ridiculous amount of grandmas inheritance money  into Intel and lost like 10% instantly.

I'd like to start this post by saying I used to trade forex using supply/demand and Wyckoff strategy.  
Some of the reasons why I say I used to trade forex are your usual revenge trading, dropping strategy rules just to open a trade due to being impatient etc.  
All those mental challenges coupled with high leverage never turns out well.  
One thing I took out of that experience was definitely a strategy or two that I realised are worth gold while looking at stock price charts.  
Recently I managed to catch Roblox on a run up based on supply/demand strategy and I made couple of thousand % using options.  
All that being said,I believe I have the next big play.  
I want to start by saying that there are few reasons why I believe this is a high conviction play.

I base my opinion on technical and fundamental analysis.

Technical one goes as follows:

The higher time frame, the higher the conviction seems to be the case for the strategies I'm using  
I see a pattern of ""Wyckoff"" in particular : Accumulation being formed on the highest timeframe I've seen so far.  
I don't want to go too deep into what Wyckoff is: There is plenty of info here [https://www.wyckoffanalytics.com/wyckoff-method/](https://www.wyckoffanalytics.com/wyckoff-method/)  
You can briefly get the idea from the picture.  
Highly skilled traders can have a win rate using Wyckoff of upto 70% which is just crazy.

Fundamental :

There are few reasons as to why I believe Intel is going to see some green days;  
First being interest rates coming down as projected by few investment banks.  
Second being that Intel is being crushed by competitors and have unsuccessfully been playing catch-up game with them.  
The next chip ( Panther Lake) launch window is just around the corner (Late 2025 to early 2026).

Intel is trying to compete with TSMC by offering foundry services on its advanced 18A and 14A nodes.

If a major customer (e.g., Apple, Qualcomm, or even NVIDIA) commits to Intel Foundry, the stock could re-rate sharply

Japans SoftBank Group invested 2 billion into Intel.  
US Government is exploring an option of investing 2.2billion aswell.

I believe that Intel will reach 50 dollars no later then their 1st quarter 2026 earnings.

I'm going full Diamond Hands with this idea by buying these options.

Wish me luck because this pulling through would earn me part of the money I would buy my first property with.

Not a financial advice.

144,NVDA,$Wulf - time to talk about value/gamma play 3M+ invested.,"Hi fellow regards. Infrequent but long time poster here. Posted about RKT and the one who cannot be named gamma ramp in 2021.  Today I want to tell you about the value play in WULF  and potential gamma ramp. No garbage AI needed. 

Everyone knows Nvidia and AI, and the big players meta Google OpenAI. There is a computing shortage for these AI companies and data centre companies who provide high power computing (hpc) and picking up hype.  One such player, among 5 others, is terawulf which is situated near New York.  They had a 1 billion usd contract with core42 but as of today this has expanded to over 7 billion after fluidstack/google deal (with a market cap stock of 3.9 billion)

Key factors:
The value bit. 
1- 7.7 billion in revenue in 10 years
2- no chance of default with Google backstopping 3.2 billion for 14% of the company, effectively evaluating it at 22.8 billion (6x current price)
3- No real share dilution in the last year (except above but Google won’t sell). No insider sells. 
4- still has more MW room to grow. 

The gamma ramp bit. 
3- 64% institutional ownership
4- 32% SI, 36% SV ratio
5- Recent catalyst with hyperscaler Google contract (++ exposure)

Where I think it’ll grow? $20 by December but local higher in the interim by gamma ramp potential.

148,NVDA,Why the US Government will buy into INTC - Beyond the Rumors,"Intel is the only U.S. company pursuing leading-edge logic foundry tech on U.S. soil.  Every single big tech company that designs AI chips has to go through TSMC, including nvidia.  Elon recently inked a deal with samsung.  Neither which are US based.

We can't rely on TSMC if something happens to Taiwan.  Though TSMC US plants are making good progress.  
  
DoD this years has already invested in MP Materials, for domestic rare earth mining and processing.   For the same reason they will invest in advanced chip manufacturing.  
*The U.S. Department of Defense now classifies advanced chip production as ""critical infrastructure.""*  
  
Intel has had to delay building more advanced fabs due to funding issues.  The DoD can see that adding money here could be really good for advanced domestic chip production.

The cost to import chips produced abroad could be subject to tariffs.

Trump has talked about building a sovereign wealth fund, and has said in the past we should have taken a stake while doing bailouts rather than just getting paid back via loans.

Position:  
35 price target 6 month calls - modest % of portfolio

  
Here's ChatGPT's take on my argument:

  
Thesis

Intel is the **only U.S.-owned firm pursuing leading-edge logic foundry on U.S. soil**. A strategic equity stake would extend the existing policy toolkit (CHIPS grants/loans, “Secure Enclave” procurement) to secure domestic capacity at advanced nodes, reduce Taiwan exposure, and align incentives for private capital and customers.

# Strategic rationale (condensed)

* **Unique role:** Intel is the **sole American company** attempting cutting-edge logic foundry domestically (18A → 14A), with U.S.-based R&amp;D and wafer production. That’s Intel’s and third-party assessments, and it’s the crux of the national-security argument.
* **Critical infrastructure framing:** Semiconductor manufacturing sits inside DHS/CISA’s **Critical Manufacturing Sector** and the National Critical Functions framework—formal grounds for extraordinary support.
* **Taiwan exposure, partial mitigation:** Any Taiwan shock imperils access to top-end logic. **TSMC Arizona** helps, but Fab 2 N3 **targets 2028** and N2/A16 arrive **late decade**; that’s not a complete hedge today.
* **Policy precedent (blueprint):** In **July 2025**, DoD agreed to buy **$400M** of **convertible preferred** in **MP Materials** plus a **warrant** (≈**15%** as-converted/as-exercised), then **August 2025** added a **$150M OSC loan**—a public-private package to onshore a choke point. That’s the closest analogue to an Intel equity leg.
* **Existing Intel funding (stack to build on):** Commerce awarded Intel **up to $7.865B** in CHIPS **direct funding** (plus eligibility for loans) across AZ/NM/OH/OR, and **up to $3B** for the DoD/Commerce **Secure Enclave** to expand trusted leading-edge manufacturing for government. Equity would better align upside/downside with taxpayers and help de-risk customer onboarding.
* **Execution/funding gap:** Intel has **pushed Ohio** first-fab production into **2030–2031**; equity/offtake can stabilize capex cadence and accelerate schedule confidence.
* **Trade lever (demand shaper):** The administration is **floating large semiconductor tariffs**—recent on-record signals cite **up to 300%**—with exemptions for U.S. production. Tariffs + procurement + equity is a classic triad to pull volume onshore.

# Anticipating pushback (answer in one line)

* **“Just use TSMC Arizona.”** It ramps in stages (N4 in Q4’24; N3 **2028**; N2/A16 **late decade**). Policy needs **redundant, U.S.-owned** leading-edge capacity now.
* **“Intel’s problem is tech, not money.”** True that technology is the long pole; equity doesn’t fix process gaps—but it **keeps the option alive**, anchors customers via offtake/price frameworks, and protects prior CHIPS outlays while engineering catches up. (That’s precisely how DoD structured MP Materials.)

# Timeline callout (policy &amp; industry milestones)

* **Mar 20, 2024** — Commerce announces proposed CHIPS funding to Intel (later finalized).
* **Sep 16, 2024** — **Secure Enclave**: up to **$3B** for trusted, leading-edge government chips (DoD/Commerce).
* **Nov 26, 2024** — Intel **final CHIPS award**: up to **$7.865B** direct funding.
* **Q4 2024 / 2025 updates** — **TSMC Arizona**: N4 HVM **Q4’24**; **N3** targeted **2028**; **N2/A16** **late decade**.
* **Mar 3–4, 2025** — **Intel Ohio** slips to **2030–2031** production timing.
* **Apr 29, 2025** — Intel Foundry update: **18A production U.S.-based** (OR first, AZ ramp), packaging roadmap (Foveros/EMIB).
* **Jul 9–10, 2025** — **DoD ↔ MP Materials**: **$400M** convertible preferred + **warrant** (≈**15%** potential), policy template for strategic equity.
* **Aug 2025** — DoD **OSC** executes **$150M loan** to MP for heavy REE separation.
* **Aug 15, 2025** — Admin **floats tariffs up to 300%** on semiconductors; **stake talks** in Intel surface in major outlets.

(Reuters) -CoreWeave topped Wall Street estimates for second-quarter revenue on Tuesday, driven by accelerating demand for the Nvidia-backed AI cloud computing firm's services.

The company offers access to data centers and Nvidia chips, which are highly coveted for by enterprises to train and run large AI models amid intense competition.

CoreWeave, which currently has 33 AI data centers up and running across the U.S. and Europe, focuses solely on GPU-based operations.

The company's operating expenses jumped to $1.19 billion in the quarter, compared to $317.7 million a year.

Livingston, New Jersey-based CoreWeave's shares fell 6% in trading after the bell. The stock has gained nearly three-fold since its March IPO.

Revenue backlog was $30.1 billion as of June 30, the company said.

CoreWeave reported revenue of $1.21 billion for the second quarter, compared with analysts' average estimate of $1.08 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.",257,104,1755035898.0,2025-08-12T21:58:18+00:00,t3_1momcq6
153,NVDA,0 to 265k in 2 years on a 100k/yr salary (VHCOL),"25M went from 0 to 265k in exactly 2 years (just completed my 2 year anniversary at work this past week), from my first job straight out of college. I make 100k a year before taxes and live in a VHCOL place. I max out my Roth IRA, 401k and HSA every year expecting long term tax free gains. I transfer all of the money that’s left after paying out my credit cards and rent over to my individual brokerage account. I generally have a high risk appetite but stick to stocks and limit myself to mutual funds or ETFs in my retirement accounts. 

I take home around $6,150 a month after taxes. After deducting my 401k and HSA contributions it’s comes to around $4,000. I keep my living expenses as low as possible (roughly $1,200) since my primary goal is to pile up as much money into my investment accounts as early as possible, so I can relax and spend a little more once I have a family and dependents to care for. Having said that, I try to not let it compromise my lifestyle or take away the things I like doing the most. I travel and go on low-cost budget trips at least 3 times a year while at least making one international trip. The biggest place where I save on is my rent. I pay at least less than half what most of my other friends pay who live in the same area. I live in a flex room (living room converted into a personal spacex/bedroom using curtains/room dividers) in a fancy high rise that has an amazing view overlooking the downtown area and city nearby. This also pushes me to go out of the house more often and explore places around me in the city and meet new people. 

My portfolio consists of mostly Palantir (50%) and some NVIDIA (20%) with some other promising high growth companies. It has returned a staggering 334%. My net worth makes no sense to me given how much I make. I’ve not made anywhere close to what I have now post taxes and expenses. Make it make sense to me.

1. NVIDIA and all big tech are customers
2. 20% short interest - presumably because of financial reporting fears. SMCI went from 3 million shares short a quarter ago to 95 million shares short now (Fintel). I know finance and this is no longer a problem. SMCI clearly announced they Do Not Need to restate earnings and their auditors found no instances of fraud (given US laws, you don’t casually declare this on an earnings call). 
3. Meeting or even slightly beating earnings will squeeze the shorts’ balls blue. OPEN had a short interest of 20.73%, look what happened when it squeezed.
4. Massive expected INCREASE in AI spend. Ex: Recent Google earnings announced increase to $85 billion. X (Grok) working to launch millions of GPUs and shipping a “power plant” from Europe to power it. Every AI player (MSFT, META, AMZN, Open AI etc) will do the same increasing spend to the 70-90bill range. TSMC also reported great earnings. Clear sign demand is accelerating not slowing.
5. International expansion - SMCI won a Major Exclusive $20 billion DataVolt (Saudi Arabia) deal, Ericsson.
6. Raised 2.3 billion cash and sold 1.79 billion in receivables for expansion. Big-brain move at 0% interest with capped calls. They are currently generating cash and not burning it, which means the money is primarily for planned massive growth and expansion.
7. BofA Analist Ruplu Bhattacharya, has a $35 price target on SMCI, but had a price target of $1,090 at one point, which is a ridiculous joke. Big funds probably have major short positions and are now caught with their pants down and are using their Analist to beat prices down. They don’t know computers.

161,NVDA,A Carvana Bear Case,"Hi, I don't like Carvana, and think it is massively overvalued. They shot up to an all time high of $385 after their most recent earnings report, and I wanted to post my thesis on why Carvana is worth shorting. Before we get into it, I **am** biased against Carvana, I **do** have puts on Carvana, and those puts **are** losing money. It's cool, I'm not mad. I'm definitely not mad. This is partially for my own edification and research, but hopefully you find it useful as well!

If you would like a professional opinion first, then before reading what I have to say, you may want to check out is [this report](https://hindenburgresearch.com/carvana/) on Carvana from Hindenburg. They had a similar short position and wrote their own bear case for Carvana. I think they made some salient points which have highlighted problems which have actually been getting WORSE since writing that report.

For me, I took a look at their[ most recent Earnings report](https://otp.tools.investis.com/clients/us/carvana/SEC/sec-show.aspx?Type=page&amp;FilingId=18649181-55571-322427&amp;CIK=0001690820&amp;Index=11000), as well as their [previous earnings report in May](https://otp.tools.investis.com/clients/us/carvana/SEC/sec-show.aspx?Type=page&amp;FilingId=18442840-44193-290080&amp;CIK=0001690820&amp;Index=11000).

https://preview.redd.it/w5zvkn56m8gf1.png?width=2023&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=803df496e15ff034862222302f584b01f297026d

Compared to last quarter, Carvana holds 520 million more in cars in inventory (the total value of all their cars). Their total assets have increased by 488 million. Which means they have reduced their assets by 32 million in the process of acquiring these cars. And to add my own interpretation, Carvana will buy cars often without regard to quality. There is a distinct possibility that a portion of these will sit unsold for the entirety of the company's existence. Nevertheless they count these cars as assets. According to Kelley blue book, ""On average, *new cars depreciate about 30% over the first 2 years*, and continue to depreciate 8-12% each year after that."" So even in the generous interpretation that all of these cars are sellable assets, the cars they are sitting on are only getting less valuable over time.

https://preview.redd.it/xodu17wmm8gf1.png?width=2027&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c1c56bc12cb747d5213da4edf530c8c4eec508c

But are they selling all these additional cars? On a positive note, their gross profits are up by 135 million, however once operating expenses are considered, their net income was actually down by 67 million. Net income for this quarter was 308 million, down from 373 million last quarter. This is primarily due to a 117 million increase in operating expenses.

Their liabilities have increased by 144 million. Increasing in every category across the board. When we subtract their liabilities from their assets, Carvana's equity was 1.773 billion last quarter, and 2.117 billion this quarter, increasing by 344 million. Which is less than their increase in car value. You may interpret this as an investment in high quality inventory. Or, you may interpret this to mean that they are converting themselves into a rotting graveyard of used cars. Your choice.

Regarding loans, Carvana originates car loans and then sells them to partners. They do this through forward flow agreements and fixed pool loan sales. These are blind boxes of car loans and are essentially the auto industry version of a Mortgage Backed Security, which I'm sure you remember from the 2008 financial crisis. That is NOT to suggest Carvana is going to somehow cause a financial crisis, just to add context and highlight that these are some risky sub-prime loans. Last quarter they sold 800 million in fixed pool loan sales, this quarter they sold 1.2 billion. A 50% increase.

https://preview.redd.it/8lwn6scdm8gf1.png?width=641&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=efc99f4e49c9ad8cd256c31c5f05dbc1151bdb73

You may have heard that over the course of this year, auto loan delinquencies are on the rise. LendingTree says 5.1% of Americans with Auto loans are delinquent as of this month. Carvana sells their loans, so is this relevant? Well, if Carvana's loans are a product they aim to sell, and that product is reducing in value, I think that could certainly reduce their sales. And that has been happening. Car loan company Ally has reduced their dealings with Carvana. And Carvana has been increasingly relying on these sales as a key element of their income, ""Almost 26% of Carvana’s gross profit consisted of sales of customer auto loans to third parties"" according to Hindenburg, and it's only gotten worse.

**The Grift**

If we can imagine a world where Carvana is worth $400, I think I can take a moment to imagine a world where they're bankrupt. Because they almost were, and may still be headed there, despite earnings reports. This part is more speculative, so feel free to ignore it, but the report I mentioned earlier from Hindenburg talks about Carvana's many issues which I highlighted above, and eludes to some unsavory business practices which may or may not be going on below the surface. And these are the kind of practices that wont increase your shareholder value, unfortunately.

A big one the report highlights is Carvana's relationship with DriveTime, a company owned by the founder's father. A large portion of Carvana's car sales are allegedly made to DriveTime, a used car company. The report also notes several instances when DriveTime's founder, the dad, has made a total of at least 5 billion from selling Carvana shares at the elevated price.

Hindenburg suggests, ""Carvana appears to be dumping unreported costs of extended warranties onto related-party DriveTime, resulting in artificially inflated revenue and profitability. We estimate Carvana reports \~58% more warranty income per sale due to the relationship.""

What could be happening here is that Carvana is offloading unsellable cars to DriveTime in exchange for dad's cut of Carvana. But at some time in the future DriveTime will declare bankruptcy and Carvana will be unable to continue inflating their numbers.

Is this believable? Well Hindenburg also states that the father and owner of DriveTime previously ""pled guilty to felony bank fraud over allegations that he helped a company report fake accounting income through sham transactions. SEC charges also alleged he “signed a falsified letter for \[the company’s\] auditors."" So this could literally just be the dad repeating his past grift after getting caught in his last venture. And shareholders may be the ones being grifted.

The other issue is with loan sales. Given Ally's reduced business, how has Carvana continued to offload their subprime auto loans? Maybe they haven't. According to Hindenburg, ""In the past two quarters, Carvana sold $800 million in loans to an “unrelated third party.” The mystery buyer made up 18.3% and 16.3% of total loan sales in Q2 and Q3 2024""

I can't verify this, as it is shrouded in secrecy. The report implies that the loans are being sold to ""Cerberus Capital, where Carvana Director Dan Quayle is Chairman of Global Investments""

And on top of that, they also make the allegation that ""Carvana’s loans held on its books have increased 50% since 2021, to $553 million in Q3 2024. Carvana uses an accounting treatment that records no loss reserves on these loans at booking""

So they aren't actually able to offload all of these toxic assets, even to Cerberus Capital, and at some point, this will come tumbling down. It wont bring the stock market with it like in the 2008 financial crisis, but Carvana themselves would certainly go bankrupt. If you aren't going to sell, at LEAST set a stop loss.

**Valuation**

Leaving the very plausible bankruptcy question out of the equation, let's consider Price to earnings based SOLELY on what was actually reported. Carvana stock's biggest issue right now is its extremely distorted valuation.

To compare, let's look at a reasonable competitor, Carmax. Carmax sells used cars online. Carmax also sells car loans. It's also a dinosaur, one I would not personally look at or even think about if not for this post. But here goes.

|For Most Recent Quarter|Share Price|Earnings (EBIT)|Earnings Per Share|Price to Earnings (ttm)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Carvana|$385|308 Million|$1.28|117.81|
|Carmax|$58|283 Million|$1.38|16.38|

As you can see, Carmax looks to be a better earner than Carvana. And no, I dont think Carmax is the one being incorrectly valued.

To be thorough, let's also compare their most recent Book values, which is equivalent to the total stockholder equity. Carvana's most recent book value is 2.1 billion, and Carmax's book value is 6.2 billion. Barchart's most recent Book value per share puts, Carvana at 8.3 per share, and Carmax at 41.89 per share.

But what SHOULD Carvana's value be? Well that depends on your valuation method. Let's go through them.

**""Carvana should be priced for growth""**

This is about as positive a take as you can get. This is assuming Carvana grows according to its own estimates, which is predicted by analysts and represents their view of the stock's growth. I am using a forward PE ratio for this calculation, which is equal to the current stock price divided by the estimated earnings for the future. Note that this is a 12 month calculation so the PE values will be slightly different than a ten trailing month PE.

|Earnings Per Share Projections|EPS|(Forward) PE|(Future) Stock Price With 25.90 PE|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|EPS Real 2024|$1.59|242|$41.18|
|EPS Estimate 2025|$5.06|76|$131.05|
|EPS Estimate 2026|$6.23|61.79|$161.36|
|Nvidia Estimate 2025|$4.02|43.96|$104.12|

So as you can see, in this reality, Carvana is a much better growth stock than Nvidia, which is widely considered the most valuable stock in the world. Just kidding, of course. Even assuming this level of growth, Carvana has an extremely high premium attached to it.

The final column estimates what the valuation would be if Carvana was given the average PE of stocks in the S&amp;P 500 right now (which is about 5.9 above historical averages, so pretty generous I think). As you can see, any stock price above $131 is pretty clearly pricing in returns from 2026, and even that suggests a **66% downside** from it's current level at $385.

**""Carvana should be equal to Carmax's Price to Earnings""**

What if Carvana was valued based on its earnings per share at the same level that carmax is (16.38), based on the ten trailing months for both?

|Price To Earnings|EPS (ttm)|16.38 PE|Stock Price|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Carvana|2.85|(2.85 \* 16.83)|$46.68|
|Carmax|3.68|(3.68 \* 16.83)|$60.27|

So in this reality, Carvana is a stock trading BELOW Carmax at $50 a share, representing an **82% downside**.

**""Carvana should be equal to Carmax's Price to Book Value""**

What if Carvana was valued based on the same Price to book value that carmax is? The book value is used sometimes when evaluating a company based on its raw value. Car companies and banks sometimes trade for a value pretty close to their book value, as they are not often priced for growth.

|Price To Book Value|Book Value Per Share|1.44 Price To Book Value|Stock Price|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Carvana|$8.30|(8.3 \* 1.44)|$11.95|
|Carmax|$41.89|(41.89 \* 1.44)|$60.32|

In THIS reality, Carvana would ALSO be trading below Carmax at $12 a share, representing a **97% downside**. And on top of that, we have to consider that both of these businesses are considering their cars to be assets, when those cars may or may not actually be worth as much as reported. So to be REALLY negative, you could say 97% downside is charitable.

**Carvana should be equal to its price target**

In this reality, you never read this post and dont care about anything except what REAL stock analysts say. Okay. Well, fine. The street high price target is $450 per share, representing a **16.9% upside** over the next 12 months. The average is $352.17, representing an **8.5% downside**, and the lowest is $260 representing a **32.5% downside**. So all but the most bullish of analysts also agree that Carvana is actually ABOVE what its price should be in 12 months.

**Summary**

If you ask me, Carvana is overvalued. Possibly by an order of magnitude. Buy puts on it if you're a sicko like I am and want companies to be valued reasonably. A valuation sicko. And then I guess tell people about it, because unless people actually BELIEVE it's overvalued, it's going to stay overvalued until the truth comes out.

My advice to current shareholders is to take your profit and put it into a healthy business. Or if you aren't invested, consider long dated puts! If word is able to get out about this, maybe consider shorter dated puts, who knows?

**TL;DR**

Carvana scam stock, buy puts.

165,NVDA,Google’s AI Awakening: Earnings Bull Case,"# Beyond the AI hype, YouTube's dominance and a transforming Search business create a powerful, and potentially undervalued, growth story.

As Nvidia Corp. solidifies its position as a $4 trillion titan on the back of the AI hardware boom, a compelling debate is intensifying on Wall Street over what some see as a glaring valuation gap: Alphabet Inc., the parent company of Google.

While shares of the search giant have performed well, they have lagged the explosive, triple-digit gains of the companies building the ""picks and shovels"" of the AI revolution. This has led to a growing belief among some investors that Google, with its deeply integrated ""full stack"" of AI assets, is on the cusp of a significant re-rating. They are betting that the company’s upcoming second-quarter earnings report on July 23 will be the primary catalyst, forcing the market to shift its focus from the cost of Google's AI ambitions to the reality of its profits.

“For years, AI was a massive cost center for Google. The question for the second half of 2025 is whether it can become a massive profit center,” says one technology strategist. “Next week’s report is the first real test of that thesis.”

# The Unseen Competitor Winning the Streaming Wars

While investors have been fixated on Google's AI story, the recent earnings report from Netflix provided an inadvertent, and powerful, bull case for one of Google’s most valuable assets: YouTube.

Netflix’s management noted the intense competition for viewer engagement, and recent Nielsen data tells the story. In May, YouTube commanded 12.5% of all U.S. television screen time, significantly ahead of Netflix’s 7.5%. This data confirms that YouTube is not just a mobile video app, but the dominant media platform in the modern living room.

Financially, the scale is staggering. YouTube’s advertising revenue alone, at over $34 billion annually, is nearly the size of Netflix’s entire global enterprise. When combined with an estimated $19 billion in subscription revenue from YouTube Premium and YouTube TV, a hypothetical standalone “YouTube Inc.” would be a media behemoth with over $53 billion in annual sales, far outpacing its rivals.

“Netflix’s earnings call was inadvertently the best bull case for YouTube we’ve seen all year,” noted one portfolio manager. “It confirmed who truly owns the living room, and that value has yet to be fully unlocked in Alphabet’s stock price.”

# The Bear Case Reimagined: Search as an AI Utility

A persistent fear among investors has been that AI chatbots would cannibalize Google’s core Search business, which remains its primary source of profit. A contrarian view is now emerging, however, that AI will not be a threat, but rather Search's greatest accelerator.

This thesis posits that as Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI agents become more prevalent, they will need constant access to the live, indexed web to provide up-to-date, reliable information. The most efficient and trusted source for that data is Google's Search index.

Under this model, the biggest new customers for Google Search may not be humans, but other AIs. This could transform the Search business from a consumer-facing advertising platform into a foundational “Search as a Service” utility for the entire AI economy, monetized through high-margin, programmatic API access.

“The fear was that the search box would die,” says a tech strategist. “The reality may be that the underlying Search index becomes the foundational data layer for the entire AI ecosystem—a far more valuable position.”

# The Path to $3 Trillion

For Google to close the valuation gap with its peers, investors believe the market must recognize the value of its interconnected empire. A ""sum-of-the-parts"" analysis reveals immense potential: a dominant media company in YouTube, a profitable and growing Cloud business, and a portfolio of high-risk, high-reward ""Other Bets"" like the autonomous driving unit, Waymo.

The ultimate validation of its AI leadership could come from a partnership with its biggest rival. Persistent rumors of Apple integrating Google's Gemini into iOS for advanced AI tasks draw a direct parallel to the estimated $20 billion annual deal Google pays Apple for its search default status. Such a deal would instantly cement Gemini's position as the indispensable intelligence layer for the mobile world.

The narrative for the past year has rightfully celebrated the companies building the infrastructure for AI. The bull case for Google is a bet that the focus is about to shift to the companies that can most effectively monetize it. Investors will be watching closely on July 23rd for the answer.

  
**TL;DR:**

* **Google is likely undervalued.** The market has rewarded AI hardware companies like Nvidia but hasn't yet priced in Google's ability to profit from its ""full-stack"" AI ecosystem. The July 23rd earnings report is the key catalyst to prove this.
* **YouTube is quietly winning the streaming wars.** It has more viewing time than Netflix, making it a dominant media empire whose massive value is not fully reflected in Google's stock price.
* **The ""AI is a threat to Search"" narrative is likely wrong.** The opposite is more probable: AI agents will become massive new customers, using the Google Search index as the essential data layer for the entire AI economy, creating a new, high-margin business.
* **For the first time, real revenue from AI subscriptions (Gemini, Veo) will be reported.** This shifts the story from ""AI is an expense"" to ""AI is a profit engine.""
* **A potential multi-billion dollar deal for Apple to use Gemini** (similar to their current Search deal) is a massive, often overlooked catalyst that would cement Google's AI supremacy.

169,NVDA,"Intel bagholders, I got one question for you...","Why aren't you buying more?

While you regards are circle jerking over NVIDIA's $4T market cap, Jensen is furiously dumping shares to add to his personal jacket collection. Meanwhile, Intel is playing the long game.

NVIDIA's GPU dominance is built on training hype and datacenter porn, but they're about to get steamrolled by the most predictable trend in computing history: eventually, everything runs on a fucking potato.

Here's what's really happening, GPUs weren't designed for AI, AI was designed around GPUs. We're literally running neural networks on graphics cards because that's what was available, not because it's optimal. Now that specialized training and inference hardware is coming, this whole house of cards falls apart.

Not every company is training GPT-5. Only for the top players does this even make sense. The real money isn't in the repurposed graphics cards powering today's model training. It's in the purpose-built, boring-ass processors that'll run AI inference on every toaster, doorbell, and sex toy in existence. And Intel is positioning to own that world.

# Dismantling NVIDIA's hype

Let me break this down for you mouth-breathers. Most of you have no idea what CUDA actually is or why it doesn't matter. The funny thing is neither do the companies or their developers building these AI models using it.

I'm a Platform Engineer. Which means I'm the poor bastard who has to productionize and scale the garbage that AI teams try to ship. Let me tell you, most AI ""engineers"" code like toddlers with crayons. It's embarrassing.

Picture this, you've got these script kiddies sitting in their Herman Miller chairs, MacBook Pros gleaming under the open office lighting, staring lovingly at their golden NVIDIA GPUs like they're some sort of religious artifacts. Like you, to these ape-like engineers, CUDA is simply magic. A godlike ethereal force aligning all the fairy dust just right in their $40,000 golden shrine to Jensen.

But it isn't.

CUDA is just a C++ extension with some runtime libraries. That's it. The ""moat"" everyone keeps parroting about doesn't exist because ALL the software frameworks used in the industry support multiple backends. PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX, they all run on AMD, Intel, custom silicon, whatever. The hardware is completely abstracted away. Most developers never even know what backend they're running on.

These people have zero concept of basic software engineering principles, let alone understanding the backend infrastructure their code runs on. They're statisticians and researchers who learned to use a computer the same way a medieval alchemist learned to use fire.

They believe that if it runs on their MacBook, it's production ready. They write code like they're still submitting homework assignments, except now their homework is burning through millions in compute costs.

# A Fundamental Shift is Coming

At the moment, companies everywhere are conflating training requirements with inference requirements like they're the same thing.

I've seen production deployments at major companies that would make any competent engineer weep. Burning millions per year on H100s because they can't differentiate between development and production requirements. Companies treating every ML workload like they're training GPT-5.

These deployments only exist because companies throw unlimited capex budgets at fundamentally misunderstood architectures just to get a ticket on the AI hype train. But it's not sustainable.

Training requires massive parallel compute for backpropagation. Fine, NVIDIA won that round with their Ferrari hardware. But the market is shifting from training to inference, and inference has completely different optimization requirements.

Inference is single forward passes that need to be cheap, consistent, and efficient, not just fast. A Llama model classifying support tickets doesn't need a $25,000 H100. It needs cost-effective compute that can handle steady loads without breaking the bank. These workloads are perfectly suited for whoever can deliver the best price to performance story. Literally anyone else but NVIDIA.

You can only burn through VC money and corporate budgets for so long before someone starts asking uncomfortable questions. The corporate bean counters are getting nosy about what these ""AI initiatives"" are actually producing for their massive compute spend. When finance realizes they're paying Ferrari prices for Honda Civic workloads, the free money party ends fast. And where does it go? To Intel, AMD, and every custom silicon vendor with a better price-to-performance story.

Remember DeepSeek? When they claimed comparable performance using 2,048 H800s versus competitors' 10,000+ H100s, NVIDIA lost $589 billion in market value in one day. That wasn't market overreaction. That was the market briefly glimpsing reality about AI efficiency.

If that's the market reaction to a boost in training efficiency, imagine what happens when the inference efficiency story becomes undeniable.

Specialized inference chips are already showing 5-20x performance improvements over general-purpose GPUs. When companies realize they can run their workloads on cheaper, more efficient hardware, the migration will be swift and brutal for NVIDIA's margins.

Intel's Gaudi 3 baseboards are delivering 2.9x better price performance to NVIDIA's H100 baseboards.

Meanwhile, Intel trades like a dying company when they're positioned to capture the massive inference market that everyone's ignoring. The technical setup screams bottom, the valuation is absurd, and the fundamental shift is accelerating.

# The Trade:

Positions:

INTC 2600 shares, selling covered calls every other week, selling puts with available cash as collateral.

The way I see it, you're getting paid to wait on a potential 2-3x if the turnaround works. And if it doesn't, you're buying below tangible book value while NVIDIA holders watch their gains evaporate.

INB4 ""why aren't you buying puts on NVIDIA?"":

Listen, that stock has more momentum than a freight train on cocaine. Maybe it keeps ripping to $300 while I'm crying into my positions. But physics applies to stonks too, and what goes parabolic eventually comes back to earth.

I'd rather bet on the inevitable winner of the post-hype reality than try to time the peak of an irrational bubble.

176,NVDA,$CRWV My Investment Strategy,"As a longtime investor in the AI infrastructure track, I've taken a deep dive into CoreWeave's acquisition of CoreScientific and have come to a different conclusion than the market. Let me share my complete thought process.

First, I carefully analyzed the core value of the deal. By acquiring CoreScientific, CoreWeave will gain 1.34 GW of off-the-shelf data center capacity and an additional 700 MW of expansion space. This opened my eyes to several key advantages:

1: Up to $500 million in annual lease cost savings

2: Complete control over data center design and operations, enabling greater flexibility to serve AI customers

3: Anticipated $350 million in new hosting revenue by 2026

The market's reaction to this deal baffles me. The reasons for the stock's decline I would summarize as three:

1: Investors are concerned about the equity dilution effect

2: Doubts about CoreScientific's digital currency business

3: Disapproval of the asset-heavy operating model

But my research came to a different conclusion. In my opinion.

Equity dilution is a short-term effect, with significant integration benefits in the long term

Digital currency business only accounts for a small part, the core value is in data center assets

The asset-heavy model builds a more solid competitive barrier in the AI era instead.

I particularly value CoreWeave's unique advantages:

1: Deep cooperation with NVIDIA, first to deploy Blackwell chips

2: Obtaining long-term large orders from OpenAI and Microsoft

3: Specialized AI cloud service capabilities

Based on the price targets ($150-200) from organizations such as Argus and Mizuho, I believe the current $145 share price is significantly undervalued. My investment strategy is:

1: Gradually build a position before the end of the lockup period

2: Target to hold for 6-12 months and wait for integration benefits to emerge

3: Set a 10% stop-loss level to control risk.

Of course, I am also aware of the potential risks

Too much dependence on large customers such as OpenAI

Data center construction may not be as expected

Increased competition in the AI industry

However, after weighing the overall situation, I still decided to increase my position. Because I believe

1: AI infrastructure is the most certain track in the next 5 years

2: CoreWeave's first-mover advantage is obvious

3: The current valuation has sufficient margin of safety

This is the complete logic of my investment in CoreWeave. Although the stock price may continue to fluctuate in the short term, I am confident in its long-term performance. I will continue to track the company's integration progress and earnings performance, and adjust my position strategy as appropriate

My bet:

Horizon illustrates the value capture clearly, costs 350M yet will deliver 60M-75M EBITDA valued at 15-20x, or 900M-1.5B, thus captures 7.3M-20M/MW in value. Even at 750k/MW on 1.92M/MW data center revenue ($160/kw/mo 2024 avg. rent, Cushman &amp; Wakefield) you get valued at 15M/MW on a 7M cost, creating 8M/MW of value. At extremely low multiple for data center of 15 x 750k/MW = 11.25M/MW, capturing 4.25M/MW or 16B across the portfolio = $70/shr

What initially gave me conviction - comparing 3.5 cents / kwh vs 6 cents for natural gas, &gt;10 cents for nuclear, saves 220-570k/MW/yr.

$CORZ potentially acquired by $CRWV  

1.3GW secured power, 500MW AI DC under construction with CRWV lease worth 7.5B (15M/MW) minus lease financing of 5B = 2.5B value

Implied value per secured MW = $3.625M/MW 

IREN has 3GW secured, though only 150MW AI under construction, worth maybe 1.875B (12M/MW, 20% less than $CORZ) minus remaining funding req of 125M = 1.75B 

IREN EV = 3.75B 
IREN mining = 51 EH (650M EBITDA * 3x) = 1.95B
IREN EV ex AI DC = 2B

Data Centers in 2025:
Bloom Energy 2025 Datacenter Report: Mid-Year Pulse

 Executive Context: Power Is Now the Bottleneck

AI’s exponential growth is colliding with a fundamental constraint: electricity. 
.By 2028, U.S. data centers are expected to consume 12% of the nation’s electricity—up from just 4% in 2023.
.Some hyperscale campuses are projected to demand over 1 GW, equivalent to powering 800,000 homes.
.This new reality is shifting power availability from a ""consideration"" to a strategic constraint that can determine the success or failure of a data center buildout.

1. Power Access Has Surpassed All Other Site Criteria
.84% of developers now rank power availability among their top three considerations, far surpassing fiber proximity, regulations, and labor access.
.A year ago, fiber was the top concern—this shift underscores how pressing the power situation has become.

2. Power Delays Are Widely Underestimated
.Data center developers are underestimating grid connection timelines by 1–2 years.
.For example, in high-demand markets like Northern Virginia and Phoenix, developers think they can get power by 2026–2027, while utilities are forecasting 2028 or later.
.This gap reveals a growing disconnect and puts urgency on alternative solutions like onsite generation.

3. AI Adoption Is Driving a Massive Scale-Up in Power Needs
.The median AI data center size is projected to grow:
.From ~175 MW today
.To ~275 MW by 2030
.To ~375 MW by 2035
.Much of this growth is tied to high-power chips like NVIDIA Blackwell (~1kW per GPU).
.Many facilities will also merge training and inference workloads, further compounding the energy demand.
.There's also a significant shift to DC (direct current) architectures, borrowed from EV battery systems, to better manage the power flow for water-cooled racks and high-density servers.

4. Onsite Power Is the Next Frontier
.Use of onsite power generation is expected to triple by 2030:
.38% of facilities will incorporate onsite generation (vs. 13% a year ago).
.27% expect to be fully powered onsite by 2030 (up from just 1%).

Reasons include:
.Faster deployment (vs. waiting on grid expansion)
.Control over reliability
.Load flexibility for AI workloads
.However, air permitting could become a key hurdle—especially in “non-attainment zones” with strict emissions rules. This is why low-emission fuel cell tech (like Bloom’s) is gaining favor.

 5. Reliability, Cost, and Load Flexibility Rule
.Reliability is the #1 requirement—non-negotiable.
.Cost matters, but only when paired with acceleration in time-to-power.
.Load following is now essential: AI models generate highly variable power demands, and older tech like turbines may not respond fast enough without compromising performance or emissions.
.Despite the focus on speed and cost, 95% of respondents still have carbon reduction goals, even if they’re deprioritized in the short term.

- Strategic Takeaway: Onsite Power as a Competitive Lever
.Onsite generation is no longer a Plan B—it’s a strategic enabler.
.The winners in this space will:
.Build faster by avoiding grid bottlenecks
.Maintain uptime with reliable onsite solutions
.Use scalable, flexible, and clean technologies (fuel cells, etc.)
.Plan around permitting risks with low-emissions tech

Max profit $192k, max loss if coreweave goes to 0 is $273k. The $192k premium and $465k “cash” are in money market collecting 4 percent interest, which will yield another $6,700 between now and 9/19.

There are 64 more trading days left between now and expiration, IV is at 107%, 8-9% short position relative to float. Currently nvda holds a 7% stake in coreweave and a strategic partnership, which was partially responsible for the run up. Below is a summary of the partnership from nvda:

“The general availability of NVIDIA GB200 NVL72-based instances on CoreWeave underscores the latest in the companies’ collaboration, focused on delivering the latest accelerated computing solutions to the cloud. With the launch of these instances, enterprises now have access to the scale and performance needed to power the next wave of AI reasoning models and agents.

Customers can start provisioning GB200 NVL72-based instances through CoreWeave Kubernetes Service in the US-WEST-01 region using the gb200-4x instance ID. To get started, contact CoreWeave.”

Coreweave owns data centers in the US and Canada including the fastest super computer in the world that is powered by nvda chips. The strategic partnership (as well as ownership stake) gives coreweave dibs on the latest nvda chips, which gives coreweave a leg up over its competitors. In addition to Nvda, Microsoft is another major client. It is my opinion that we are just at the beginning of an AI arms race, coreweave is in a fantastic position to reap  the benefits from money from both private and public sectors indiscriminately flowing into anything related to AI. 

Biggest concerns include 1) 325% 3 months run making coreweave susceptible to major pull back, and 2) geopolitical tensions and tariff wars may tank the market. 

However, the concerns are short term, and are alleviated by the large premium (my break even is $87.94), the stock would need to drop almost 50% from Wednesday close for me to incur a loss. Worst case scenario, I am forced to buy 3,100 shares at a loss, I will sell covered calls and wheel my way to profitability. 

Best case scenario is that coreweave closes in the $150 range with high IV on 9/19 and I get to run it back again, while collecting more premium and interest.",80,111,1750344011.0,2025-06-19T14:40:11+00:00,t3_1lfchc3

197,NVDA,why GOOGL (Alphabet) is a great buy right now,"With WWDC and the Robotaxi event next week, I'd like to discuss Google and its parent company Alphabet, they have been in trouble for a while now regarding some bullshit anti-trust cases, and I want to tell you why its pure FUD.  Google has really caught up with the rest of the Mag 7 giants in their AI advancements if you haven't noticed.  They have been doing AI machine learning since 2001.  Bard was unimpressive, but that was only little over a year ago.  The speed at which they have been making new advancements is almost hard to track (even across other LLM's).

Have you tried Gemini?  VEO 3 costs 250/m and people are loving it. (the rev. from that will be great as well) and the new AI mode for search seems to finally have been embraced and I think they can actually leverage AI to better serve people the right business ads / referrals.  ***Either way they are monetizing AI***\*...\*

Regarding all the FUD, I dont believe the judge can make them sell chrome, EU case is just stupid, the whole thing is about them having monopoly on search and ads...  well there is Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo, Perplexity, Meta / Instagram business Ads, etc..  they have no monopoly anymore if there was one...

I dont believe the cases will result in anything materially bad for the stock but nobody can be sure, so that is why I want to dig into the Fundmental and Technical Analysis.

# ----------- Fundamentals -----------

Alphabet is a massive conglomerate with many subsidiaries.  Lets talk about how they are competing and kicking ass in so many different industries.

\-

**AI:**  

*VEO 3, AI Mode, Gemini, DeepMind* \- Competing with GPT pro, Microsoft, etc.  (note VEO 3 is still the only model that does text to video PLUS audio.  I think they leveraged youtube for it.

**Data Centers / Internet Provider:**

\-----*Google Cloud, TPU's, Google Fiber* \-Competing with many, but their TPU's are very good for AI data centers, and google Fiber competes with internet / service providers like AT&amp;T / Comcast / T-Mobile, etc..

**Quantum Computing:**

\------Competing with Microsoft, IBM, Rigetti, etc.

**Smart Phones:**

\------*Android, Pixel Phone* (with Gemini that kicks Siri's ass) - competing with Apple big-time

**Streaming / Ads:**

\------*Youtube &amp; Google Ads* \- Competing with Meta and Netflix

**Smart Home / Wearables:**

\------*Nest, Fitbit,* &amp; ***XR Glasses*** \- Competing with Amazon, Apple's announced glasses and their 'watch', Microsoft, etc.

**Autonomous Driving / UAV Delivery:**

\------***Waymo, Wing*** \- Competing with Tesla (been kicking their ass on it for a while now), GM, and yes, Amazon Air delivery.  *They also just announced another partnership with Walmart to bring more drones to over 100 stores for deliveries!*

**AI in Healthcare / Biotech:**

\------*Verily, &amp; Calico* \- working on aging / genetics and ai in healthcare.

\-*and probably a few others i've missed..*.  but the scope of their work is clear.

\-

When you buy GOOGL you are buying the entirety of Alphabets investments.  And they are so well positioned from a fundamental and financial perspective as seen in this group of charts.  They make double nearly double the revenue of Nvidia...

[Google makes more revenue than the rest of the Mag 7, nearly double Nvidia's earnings!  the only exception of Apple which could be in jeopardy too if they dont continue to innovate.](https://preview.redd.it/i61ok3bywl5f1.png?width=1183&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab383da02f61b9d5fdc7bb71ce2bde6c7d453ac2)

\-

Yet oddly, Google has the lowest P/E (price to earnings) ratio than the rest of the Mag 7!  That seems off if you ask me.  I believe they can take plenty of market share back in the future based on these 2 figures.

https://preview.redd.it/a61jyxhzwl5f1.png?width=1125&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b85188b91cd7b2b6b95516e18513586d86d630b

# -------- Technical Analysis --------

so now lets look at the Chart!  Because Price Action Speaks more than anything else...

I like to use Multiple Timeframes for analysis so here I have the 4 hour, daily, and weekly charts.

I know there are a lot of lines and colors, dont be scared.  The indicators I use are patterns combined with price action, fib levels, TTM squeeze, RSI and some other factors such as price gaps.

\- With RSI, above/below the 50 line tells you if momentum is bullish or bearish.  All the higher timeframes are above that 50 line indicating a potential bullish reversal.

\- With TTM it makes it easier to visualize these momentum shifts.  Right now my focus is on that Weekly chart on the bottom right - higher time frames are usually more important and it appears to be on the verge of a weekly breakout.  Now with a stock like this it could take months to reach that earnings Gap and make a new all time high.  When or If this happens depends on a lot of factors, but I am only focusing on the chart.

\- The Fibonacci Retracements I mostly use for the 50% line to determine if the price has had a change of trend.  Right now the price is attempting a breakout above this retracement and if it can break over 175 then there is plenty of room up.

\- Ive also illustrated some patterns and concepts on the chart.  Inverted Head and Shoulders, Trendline Break, Higher Highs and Higher Lows, potentially an even larger inverted H&amp;S on the daily chart to the top right.

https://preview.redd.it/d2fprue33m5f1.jpg?width=3676&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77f0a1e390e7b81ec6f893f6f38220ffc3fde21f

Ok so what does this technical analysis mumbo jumbo mean?  Its hard to say because of Trump, Tarrifs, Deals, Interest Rates, Bonds, Geopolitics, the fact that the market has already just about reached all time highs and this is lagging...  it is concerning.  It could also just be setting up for a massive (bearish) head and shoulders as you might notice on the bottom right weekly chart.

But with WWDC, RoboTaxi, and several trump deals supposedly taking place next week, we could be setup for some bullish continuation if these tech events impress.  Either way, Long Term I believe Google / Alphabet stock will get back to 200.

From a technical and fundamental perspective they are in great shape.  I would even bet that if the market pulls back, that institutions may rotate their Mag 7 holdings into the laggards such as this and Amazon.

While they are aggressively competing with so many different companies and industries, their earnings are expected to continue to grow and as you saw earlier, they earn double what Nvidia earns... Pelosi still has calls, and lets face it, you still use some kind of google product in your life whether its youtube, your android based phone, ai / gemini research, waymo, etc...  I believe Google is well positioned to be a winner this year in AI and many of its subsidiary company products.

\--------------

# TLDR:

**Alphabet is a great Bet !**

I currently am selling put credit spreads on GOOGL, and have several 180 calls for 7/18 that I only plan to hold through next week before I re-enter as there is going to be a lot going on next week for the markets.  Their earnings are on 7/22 I believe, so August may be a better strike date.  Shares or LEAPS (calls dated atleast for 2026) are also a good idea IMO, you can sell calls against them to hedge when there are large spikes.

**Anyway, I am highly regarded** ***and this is not financial advice,*** but I am very bullish on Google long term.  Its not an easy one to trade if you like short dated options, you need patience, but the chart, the p/e ratios, the incredible amount of subsidiaries competing with more than other Mag 7 companies makes this thing a highly undervalued growth &amp; value stock.

*Price Target short term - 180*

*Price Target long term - 200+*

I am a senior level IC at a FAANG and deal with AI regularly and I only buy stocks in things I deal with and understand.

I looked into this when my wife came home with the wrong type of thumb drive for her stupid Macbook (a Sandisk that requires a USB - thank you Apple for removing those fucking ports on everything). Was curious if this was a company I could short and then learned what they were doing. Now I think this is a sleeper pick that nobody's really paying attention to.

**Product deep dive:**

* NVIDIA certified Sandisk’s Gen5 eSSDs for datacenter use. Certification means they're officially in the vendor chain for AI servers.
* Additionally, they've also built something called High Bandwidth Flash (HBF) which is a new memory architecture built for massive memory capacity and throughput (important for AI). Nobody else is making this and it's developed in-house (one of the main reasons I bought).
* Sandisk is shipping one of the most power-efficient flash technologies available right now, BiCS8.
* Cloud sales—12% of Sandisk’s total output went to AWS/GCP/Azure this quarter, up from 8% a year ago. My employer is one of these and our AI spend is essentially a blank check. It's kind of an arms race right now.
* AI spend isn't going to stop. I work in a part of a FAANG where we're seeing complete transformation plans to overhaul our customer-facing service into an AI-heavy experience. Yes a lot of companies are bleeding money on this but a lot aren't. I see the sales numbers and the internal productivity boost we've gotten is insane.

**Brand shift:**

Yes they do still make consumer stuff. But IGAF about thumb drives sold at Walmart. What they are building gives them a seat at the table for large AI-related deals.

**Earnings TLDR:**

* Revenue: $1.7B
* Adjusted free cash flow: $220M
* Cash on hand: $1.5B
* Forecast: demand strengthening through year-end
* Gross margin took a hit (22.7%), but they’re working on it through pricing and cost controls

This was their first full quarter as a standalone company after separating from Western Digital. Still early.

**Other areas they’re moving into:**

* **EV**: Flash tech being used for autonomous driving, just nominated Ford Supplier of the Year. NOTE: I am not an EV person and haven't really gone down this rabbit hole. I'm just looking into the AI side.
* **Gaming**: Their new SSDs are winning “Best Of” awards
* **Content creation**: Rolled out pro-grade memory cards and high-performance portable SSDs

**Risks:**

* Gross margins were down this quarter—mostly due to pricing pressure and the usual NAND volatility
* Consumer segment is still soft
* Goodwill impairment made GAAP numbers ugly (-$1.8B), though this was non-cash and tied to the separation
* This is absolutely a lotto play.
* Thin options liquidity. I just got shares.

201,NVDA,$APLD: This ain’t a stock. It’s a launchpad. Public Pureplay on the AI Bottleneck.,"I’m long APLD.

Applied Digital is a developer of next-generation infrastructure for AI. They have two segments: (i) custom-built, high-performance data centers; and (ii) GPUs as a service. Applied is currently focused on a large 400MW data center project in Ellendale, ND, and is marketing a 1.4GW pipeline of additional capacity. Please see the company’s latest investor presentation on their website for more details. 

There is a frenzy for compute power by both hyperscalers and Fortune 500 companies, covered extensively everywhere you look. Power and datacenter capacity is the new bottleneck. Nvidia’s CEO, Jensen, has and continues to discuss the need to modernize a trillion dollars worth of data centers to tap into AI’s potential. APLD is a first mover aiming to capture this opportunity.

APLD’s history in developing power hungry crypto hosting sites in low-cost power locations was the perfect preparation for today’s AI opportunity. APLD’s foray into North Dakota for cheap electricity to fund crypto mining left the company with relationships and access to massive low cost power, low cost land with space for expansion, room for additional wind/solar farms to be integrated, state tax incentives, and cooler temperatures which are beneficial for the TCO of high density AI data centers. A healthy dose of luck contributed to locking up this opportunity, industry participants have told me you cannot underscore just how valuable this power and first mover advantage is for prospective customers. If GPUs are the pickaxes behind the AI revolution, power guys are swinging the axes.

**Unit Economics and Valuation**

**HPC Data Centers**
The rule of thumb for data centers is it costs $8-12 million per MW to build and each MW can generate ~$1mm of NOI. Applied Digital’s Ellendale campus has signed 250 MW of 15-year leases with CoreWeave, expected to generate $7 billion of total revenue over those 15 years (≈$466.7 million per year). That works out to ≈$1.867 million of revenue per MW per year. Assuming a typical HPC/data center EBITDA margin of 50–60 %, each MW will likely produce $0.9–$1.2 million of NOI per year. Therefore, the 250 MW currently under contract should yield $233–$280 million of NOI annually. At a 5–6 % cap rate, that implies an enterprise value (TEV) in the $3.9–$5.6 billion range for the signed 250 MW. If the full 400 MW build is leased at similar economics, total NOI would be $360–$480 million per year, implying TEV of $6–$9.6 billion. The remaining 150 MW of backlog could contribute up to $150 million of additional annual NOI—i.e., another $2.5–$3 billion of TEV—if signed at comparable rates. 

Locking in the 250 MW CoreWeave lease translates into roughly $3.3–$5.17b of equity, or about $15–$23 per share. Each additional 100 MW of backlog, using $0.9–$1.2 m of NOI per MW and a 5–6 % cap rate, would be worth approximately $5/share using the same math. If Applied is able to lock in 1.4GW of projects, that’s an additional $70/share of value that could be created. Haircut all of this however you prefer. The numbers can get wild.

**Applied Digital Cloud**
This segment has not been a focus for the company or the investment community recently, but is an underappreciated lotto ticket. Think of it as an early-stage CoreWeave. The business model is simple: they purchase GPUs from NVDA, install them in data centers, and lease them to customers for a fixed contract term that is typically 2-3 years. The GPUs typically pay for themselves during the initial lease term, leaving Applied Digital Cloud owning them free and clear at the end of the lease term for several more years of use. Applied takes very little risk here because at the time they purchase the GPUs there is already a contract in place for a full pay back of the equipment.

The NVDA investment is especially important for this segment because this is where NVDA can drive Applied’s future success. The hyperscalers are working on their own chips and are frienemies, so it is in NVDA’s long-term interest to ensure that there is a healthy ecosystem to support the consumption of their GPUs. They want companies like Applied and CoreWeave to prosper. NVDA can assure Applied’s success in a variety of ways by providing: (i) early allocations of the latest products; (ii) the best customer prospects who want to consume NVDA’s products as a service; and (iii) capital.

Consider what NVDA’s support did for CoreWeave. NVDA invested $100MM in CoreWeave in 2023 at a $2BN valuation. As of September 2024 CoreWeave was raising money at a $23BN valuation…. And look at where they are now. 

Valuing this segment is tricky because it is just getting started. If we assume it’s worth just 10% of CoreWeave, that’s $7BN. And it goes up from there. In the fullness of time, if Applied Digital Cloud prospers, then the company will spin this out as a separate company.   

**The High Level Setup**
Based on the recently announced data center lease with CoreWeave, it is clear that APLD is the real deal and has a chance to be a leader in the next gen data center buildout. BUT despite the recent surge in stock price, it has yet to go from zero to hero with the stock price still being vastly under valued.
 
Applied Digital will be the only pure play next-gen data center player in the public markets. There is no short thesis when NVDA and Related are anchor investors and a hyperscaler is a long-term partner and customer. APLD will fundamentally be worth a lot more than current prices, the stock should disconnect from any fundamental grounding as a result of being a public pureplay on the next AI bottleneck. The right tail asymmetry of this investment is under appreciated.  

**TLDR:** Company that used to mine magic internet money accidentally built a gold mine for AI. Now NVDA’s homies are renting it out, and the GPU gods might bless them with infinite tendies. Bags secured, brain not required

The week follows a close to May trading, which was generally upbeat for stocks, featuring strong performances from the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite. Recap Investopedia's coverage of last Friday's trading here. The week also brought the latest set of trade ructions, with President Donald Trump on Friday raising fresh questions about the state of affairs with China.

In addition to a jobs report due Friday, investors also will be watching for reports on job openings and private-sector payrolls. Updated data on the U.S. trade deficit and consumer credit levels will be in focus, as will manufacturing and services industry data, including the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), construction spending, and factory orders.

In addition to Powell’s comments on Monday, Fed representatives speaking this week include Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker, Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan, and Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee.

Market watchers will be tracking expected earnings reports from Broadcom (AVGO), CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Dollar Tree (DLTR), Dollar General (DG), and Five Below (FIVE).

**Jobs Report Comes As Fed Faces Pressure on Interest Rates**  
The scheduled Friday release of the May U.S. jobs report will show whether the labor market continues to exhibit strength after employers added more jobs than analysts expected in April, as the unemployment rate remained at 4.2%.

Trump has been applying pressure on the Fed to cut interest rates from their current levels of 4.25% to 4.5%. Fed officials have said that they are in “wait-and-see” mode as the labor market remains strong and inflation comes under pressure from U.S. tariffs.

Earlier in the week, market watchers will get updates on job openings, private-sector payrolls, and weekly jobless claims.

Several Fed officials are scheduled to speak, including Federal Reserve Chair Powell, Dallas Fed President Logan, Chicago Fed President Goolsbee, and Philadelphia Fed President Harker. On Wednesday, the Fed’s Beige Book will provide more details on economic conditions throughout the country.

The Thursday scheduled report on the U.S. trade deficit comes as tariff threats have pushed shippers to increase imports ahead of the expected import taxes.

Investors will also be watching manufacturing and services industry surveys scheduled for release this week, as well as updated data on consumer credit levels, factory orders, and construction spending.

**Tech, Retail Earnings Reports in Focus**  
Chipmaker Broadcom’s scheduled financial report, due Thursday, comes on the heels of industry leader Nvidia’s (NVDA) report last week that showed continued demand for artificial intelligence (AI) products. Broadcom reported a 77% jump in its AI-related revenue in its most recent financial release as company executives forecast continued growth in that sector.

Cybersecurity company CrowdStrike Holdings is expected to release its earnings on Tuesday. The firm said in early May that it planned to cut 5% of its workforce. Guidewire Software, which provides services to insurance providers, is also expected to deliver an update on its AI products Tuesday.

Logistics software provider Descartes Systems Group is expected to release its earnings on Wednesday. Shippers continue to grapple with the impact of Trump's tariffs on the supply chain.

With consumer sentiment surveys showing increasing concerns over economic conditions, investors will be watching reports from retailers for signals on spending. Scheduled reports from Dollar General on Tuesday and Dollar Tree and Five Below on Wednesday will provide a look at consumer traffic at those stores. Campbell’s scheduled report on Monday will shine a light on food spending, while fashion brands Lululemon and Calvin Klein parent PVH also will be reporting.

Other noteworthy reports this week include Chinese electric vehicle maker NIO, a competitor to Tesla in that country, and information technology provider Hewlett Packard Enterprise.",417,85,1748783327.0,2025-06-01T13:08:47+00:00,t3_1l0okjz

205,NVDA,Quantum Scamming Inc: The Big Short Nobody Saw Coming,"Morning fellas, I'm back after more than three years to bring you my highest conviction idea ever. I'm talking 90%+ downside.

**TL;DR:** Quantum computing stocks are the next great meme bubble — a flaming clown car of hype, government grants, and zero actual business. Companies like $QBTS, $IONQ, $RGTI, and especially $QUBT (which literally used to sell flavored beverages) are pretending to be tech plays while burning through cash with nothing to show for it. Even if quantum computing becomes real, Google and IBM already won the arms race. Experts say useful quantum is still 20–30 years away — not 3. This is *The Big Short 2: Quantum Boogaloo*. I’m shorting these frauds before they drop another 90%. Strap in.

**Introduction:**

Quantum stocks ripped aggressively since the beginning of the year, after the announcement of Willow, Google's new quantum processor. First of all, Google didn't even come up with anything groundbreaking. Ironically, this also highlights how far ahead Google is from the competition. Even worse, some of the stocks below don't even make quantum computers at all.

Quantum computing is 20-30y+ away, if at all. Yet the stocks trade like they cured cancer yesterday. This is honestly a lot worse than Nikola and EV stocks for those who were there back then. They are totally misunderstood by retail, and some of them literaly have 90%+ downside.

**Quantum Computing Basics:**

Quantum computing isn't a better computer. It's a compeltely different paradigm that is only useful to solve very specific and esoteric problems. Like factoring big prime numbers (even that doesn't even work yet) or doing weird matrix math *only under certain condtions.*

To run these algorithms, you don't need just a couple qubits, you need error corrected logical qubits, which take *thousands* of physicals qubits. We're barely

One of the biggest issues with quantum computeers is gate fidelity. This measures how a quantum gate actually performs its intended operation compared to an ideal, noise-free version of that gate. Today, even the best systems get around 99.9% fiedlity under perfect lab conditions. This sounds high, but due to the exponential scaling of quantum algorithms, erors compoound extremely quickly and at 99.9% they are literaly useless. Quantum algos need billions of error free operations and we're nowhere closes. For comparisons, classical computers have gate fidelity of between 10^(-15) and 10^(-18). Thats eighteen 9s after 99, or 99.99999999999999999%. Its not that quantum computers are behind classical computers - *they're basically unusable*

**Industry Experts**

Why should you believe me when I say quantum computing doens't work? After all I'm just a muppet. If you don't take my word for it, listen to the leading industry experts, that spend their days working on it.

Scott Aaronson (Professor, UT Austin, top quanutm complexity theorist):  
""We're nowhere near large-scale quantum computers. The real applications are speculative and still a long way off""

Jensen Huang (CEO, NVIDIA):  
""Quantum computing is decades away. It will not replace classical computing. It's a different tool for very specific problems.""

Dr. Isaac Chuang (MIT, pionner in quantum information):  
""Quantum computers are not yet practical, and may not be for a long time. The barriers are fundamental""

Even if all these people are wrong, Google and IBM are so far ahead, that they'll be the clear winners.

**The Trade:**

The most overvalued and ridiculous names are: $QUBT, $QBTS, $IONQ, $RGTI. I'm short only the first two. They're all ridiculous, but at least IONQ and Rigetti have somewhat of a product.

$QUBT: This is literaly a scam, they've got very little to do with Quantum. These guys were literaly a beverage company. They don't build quantum computers. They sell vague ""quantum inspired"" software with 0 commerical traction. They claim to be ""hardware-agnostic"", which literaly reads ""we don't have a machine"". Imagine being a quantum computing stock with no computer. Revenue in 23 was $100k, not millions, $100k. This is not even a real business, just a vehicule made to earn a quick buck. Their software doens't even require a qaumtum processor to run, it's just classical code with buzzwords. This is my highest conviction short.

$QBTS: These guys make quantum annealers, not even a real quantum computer. They've een in business for 25 years, and only make $9m in revenue, with a market cap of $4.7bn. They were on the brink of bankruptcy, trading for $1, with no cash left. Then the Willow anouncement came and they manage to issue some stock and get some cash back. As a reminder, Willow has nothing to do with QBTS, this will end going back to 0 after the hype subsides.

NVIDIA revenue year-on-year growth rate, the lowest single-quarter growth rate in two years, but still stronger than analysts expected growth rate of 66%.

Earnings, Q1 NVIDIA H20 chip export restrictions on NVIDIA had a significant impact. NVIDIA adjusted EPS growth of 33% year-on-year, less than half of the previous quarter's 71% growth rate, $ 0.81 EPS is lower than analysts' expectations of nearly 13%. However, if you exclude the impact of H20 expenses, EPS rebounded to $0.96, also more than 3% higher than analysts' expectations of $0.93.

Gross margins changed similarly, with Q1 adjusted gross margin at 61%, down 17.9 percentage points year-on-year and well below analysts' expectations of 71%. And excluding the impact of H20 gross margin was 71.3%, roughly in line with analyst expectations and NVIDIA's own guidance.

215,NVDA,NVIDIA Artificial Intelligence,"Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA)) has outperformed every stock in the S&amp;P 500 ([\^GSPC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC)) since [the launch of ChatGPT ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/how-chatgpt-changed-the-world-of-tech-in-just-one-year-180957543.html)in late November 2022 Shares in the chipmaker have risen nearly 700% since ChatGPT brought the power of artificial intelligence to the masses, far outpacing the S&amp;P 500's roughly 45% over the same time period. The next closest gain for an S&amp;P 500 company in that time period is a 540% pop for Vistra Corp ([VST](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VST)).Nvidia has established itself as the key provider of chips needed to operate AI systems. Now at the epicenter of an AI arms race, Nvidia has established itself as[ a cornerstone of the recent bull market](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/live/stock-market-today-tech-leads-stocks-higher-as-nvidia-surges-to-record-high-175727614.html) in stocks as the company's sales and profits have skyrocketed over the past several years.

Ahead of the [company's next quarterly earnings release on May 28](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-to-report-q1-earnings-as-middle-east-deals-export-control-reprieve-boost-stock-122728218.html), we broke down some of the most eye-popping charts that show how Nvidia became one of the most-followed stocks in the market.There's perhaps no clearer way to see how Nvidia ran away from the competition in the AI boom than looking at the company's market capitalization against its peers. Back when ChatGPT launched, Nvidia had a market cap of just over $400 billion. It's now over $3.3 trillion. Over that same time period, chip competitor Intel's ([INTC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/INTC)) market cap has actually decreased, while Advanced Micro Devices' ([AMD](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMD)) market cap has increased incrementally from $125 billion to $177 billion.Nvidia's rise proved to be at the center of a new technological boom. Combined with Nvidia, the rise in dominance of six other companies — Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)), Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL), [GOOG](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG)), Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)), Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)), Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)), and Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)) — formed what would come to be known as the [""Magnificent Seven.""](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/one-chart-shows-how-the-magnificent-7-have-dominated-the-stock-market-in-2023-203250125.html)

The group began the AI boom with a combined market cap just shy of $7 billion. Now, two and a half years later, the Big Tech group's market cap is worth over $16.8 trillion. The seven companies have grown from about 22% of the S&amp;P 500's market cap in November 2022 to 32% of the index's market cap today.Given the outsized weighting in the S&amp;P 500, large swings in shares of Nvidia have become a feature of how even broad market investors are thinking about the direction of stocks. In June 2024,[ three Wall Street strategists boosted their year-end S&amp;P 500 targets](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-enthusiasm-prompts-3-wall-street-banks-to-raise-stock-market-forecasts-100027154.html), citing better-than-expected consistent performance among key AI players.

As of May 19, the Magnificent Seven have accounted for about 52% of the S&amp;P 500's gain since Nov. 30, 2022. Nvidia alone has contributed 17.21%, by far the most among the group, with the next closest stock, Microsoft, which has added about 8.8%.Nvidia's stock hasn't been rising from just hype. The company's quarterly financial metrics have soared. In the quarter ChatGPT launched, Nvidia posted revenue of $6.3 billion. Two years later, it would post revenue of $35.3 billion. That's a 460% increase in sales in two years. As seen in the chart below, the main source of growth for Nvidia has been its data center revenue segment, which includes the sales of its AI chips.

From the company's fourth quarter of 2023 to its final quarter of its 2025 reporting period, data center revenue grew almost 900%.

Nvidia's data center revenue particularly stands out when considering its rise against peers in the industry. In the final quarter of 2024, Nvidia notched a record $35.58 billion in just data center revenue, up from $3.62 billion in the final quarter of 2022.

In comparison, Alphabet's data center revenue increased to $11.96 billion, ending 2024 up from $7.32 billion in the final quarter of 2022.

What Happened?

Shares of quantum computing company IonQ (NYSE:IONQ) jumped 36.3% in the afternoon session after renewed enthusiasm for quantum computing following the sharp pullback in the first quarter of the year.

While specific news for the day wasn't immediately apparent to have caused a major surge, the company has had a series of positive announcements, including strong Q1 2025 earnings that beat analyst estimates.

Earlier in the week, the company announced a collaboration with Swedish company Einride to develop quantum solutions for fleet routing, logistics optimization, and supply chain solutions. This would also extend to Einride's autonomous and electric fleet operations worldwide, two of the fast evolving tech markets, which hold a lot of opportunities and growth potential.

Adding to the optimism, the company's CEO reiterated its ambitious mission to become the 'Nvidia of quantum computing' in an interview with Barron's.

The shares closed the day at $45.88, up 36.9% from previous close.

What The Market Is Telling Us

IonQ’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 105 moves greater than 5% over the last year. But moves this big are rare even for IonQ and indicate this news significantly impacted the market’s perception of the business.

The previous big move we wrote about was about 1 month ago when the stock gained 7.9% on the news that investor sentiment improved on renewed optimism that the US-China trade conflict might be nearing a resolution. According to reports, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reinforced this positive outlook by describing the trade war as ""unsustainable,"" and emphasized that a potential agreement between the two economic powers ""was possible."" His comments signaled to markets that both sides might be motivated to seek common ground, raising expectations for reduced tariffs and more stability across markets.

IonQ is up 4.4% since the beginning of the year, but at $45.01 per share, it is still trading 11.9% below its 52-week high of $51.07 from January 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of IonQ’s shares at the IPO in January 2021 would now be looking at an investment worth $4,168.

(NVDA) Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang to ease restrictions on chip exports to the world’s second largest economy.

“We obviously have huge respect for Jensen,” Sriram Krishnan, White House senior policy adviser for artificial intelligence, said in a Bloomberg Television interview Wednesday. “When it comes to inside China, I do think there is still bipartisan and broad concern about what can happen to these GPUs once they’re physically inside” the country, he added.

While the Trump administration still sees a security risk from widening AI chip exports to China, Krishnan said it agrees with Huang’s view that restrictions on a wide range of other US trading partners need to be revisited. The Trump administration is rescinding and moving to replace the Biden-era AI diffusion rule that Krishnan said created “GPU haves and GPU have nots.”

“When it comes to the rest of the world, we want American AI stack starting from the GPUs to the models to everything on top,” Krishnan said. “On that, Jensen and I and us are in agreement.”

Krishnan spoke hours after Huang made his most forceful public comments to date against escalating US export restrictions aimed at China. Speaking at the Computex industry conference in Taipei, Huang blasted the measures as a “failure” and urged the US to lower barriers to chip sales in China before American firms cede the market to rivals such as Huawei Technologies Co.

Huang told reporters that China will account for a $50 billion opportunity in 2026. “China has 50% of the world’s AI developers, and it’s important that when they develop on an architecture, they develop on Nvidia, or at least American technology,” he said. Nvidia recently wrote off $5.5 billion in H20 AI chips that had been designed to comply with previous export curbs, but were targeted by a new round of restrictions from the Trump administration this year.

Krishnan pointed to the flurry of projects in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates announced by American companies during President Donald Trump’s trip to the Middle East last week as evidence of a new effort to ease US allies’ access to AI. He stressed that the agreements would still contain security restrictions to prevent the illegal transfer of advanced technology to China and other adversaries.

“These deals and these GPUs are predominantly going to be run by American hyperscalers, American cloud service providers and American companies,” said Krishnan, who was a general partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz prior to joining the White House. “Most of these GPUs are going to be run, hosted, controlled by American companies.”",67,50,1747855124.0,2025-05-21T19:18:44+00:00,t3_1ks6hod

225,NVDA,What a UAE Deal Might Mean For SMCI,"This has been a pretty eventful week for SMCI and the AI sector as a whole. the acquisition of a [$20 billion deal](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/saudis-datavolt-signs-20bn-deal-with-supermicro/) with DataVolt in Saudi Arabia and a 39% jump in share price off the strength of the news and overall AI sentiment improving is enough to make any degen hard as solid veiny diamonds. One thing this week that has especially caught my eye is UAE's plan to construct a [5GW AI Campus](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2025/05/uae-and-us-presidents-attend-unveiling-phase-1-new-5gw-ai-campus-abu), with the help of G42, that will house 5GW worth of data center racks and span **10 square miles**.

To put this into perspective, thats:

* 50k 100kW full-scale liquid-cooled racks
* 3.2 **million** Nvidia Blackwell (B100) chips
* More power than NYC and San Francisco **combined**
* Equivalent to powering **3-4 million** homes or running **50 million** gaming PCs at full power 24/7

As you can see, this is an insanely ambitious feat the UAE is trying to achieve. Nonetheless, I couldn't help but ask myself, of the roughly 50k racks the UAE plans to procure, how many of those racks will be SMCI? Furthermore, whatever amount of racks SMCI does provide, how much money does SMCI stand to make from the project? Most importantly, What does that mean for the share price?

First, we need to understand what DCBBS is, and how it actually benefits customers with large scale projects like the UAE AI Campus.

DCBBS stands for **Direct Connect Backplane Building Block Solutions**, and it’s SMCI's proprietary system architecture for building **full AI racks,** not just individual servers. This means when a customer selects which AI rack configuration they want, when it arrives at their door, it comes in a form [like this](https://trendspider.com/blog/dell-and-super-micro-power-musks-ai-ambitions/). In other words, customers are getting Kitchen-Aid refrigerators sent to their fucking door that contain 30-90 Nvidia Blackwell chips and liquid cooling systems within them. No more receiving your SMCI rack order in individual server pieces that you have to assemble on your own. This greatly increases the speed in which these new data centers can go live. In most cases, these racks can be installed and plugged in in **under a day.**

Additionally, this also helps to increase their margins over time.

Traditionally, SMCI sold servers as modular building blocks. things like:

* 1U and 2U server chassis
* Motherboards
* Power supplies
* GPU trays

Customers (like system integrators, VARs, or hyperscalers) would assemble these into racks themselves. That’s low-margin business, because you’re selling parts, not solutions. the DCBBS racks contain:

* CPU &amp; GPU servers (e.g., Nvidia Blackwell, AMD EPYC, Intel Gaudi)
* Total liquid cooling (cold plates, manifolds, chillers, etc.)
* Network switches
* Rack management software
* Power distribution units (PDUs)

Why does this new model increase margins? Because it is a shift SMCI is making, from selling modular pieces that must be assembled, to selling complete solutions that are pre-assembled and ready for use upon arrival. This gives SMCI increased pricing power and in turn, increased margins. Below is a comparison table to illustrate the logic:

|Old Model (Per Server)|Rack-Scale Model (Per Rack)|
|:-|:-|
|Sell parts separately|Sell the full system integration|
|$5K–$15K ASP/server|$250K–$2M ASP per rack|
|6–10% gross margin|**15–25%+ gross margin**|
|Low-value add|**Turnkey AI solution** = premium pricing|

Now lets go more in depth:

**1. Higher Average Selling Price (ASP) per Unit**

* Traditional air-cooled servers sell for **$10K–$50K** each.
* Liquid-cooled **DCBBS racks** (often 64–96 GPUs) sell for **$2–5 million per rack**.
* Even if gross margins stay in the 8–10% range, **gross profit per rack is 40×–80× higher** than per-server sales.

Higher ASP = greater dollar-margin per unit sold, allowing SMCI to increase overall margins even with a similar percentage.

**2. Bundled Value = Control Over Margin Levers**

With DCBBS, SMCI is not just selling a server, it’s delivering:

* 8–12 liquid-cooled GPU servers
* 2000+ liquid-cooled racks a month
* Integrated CDUs (coolant distribution units)
* Power delivery + networking
* Cabling, plumbing, and chassis integration
* Software/BIOS optimization

All of these are designed, manufactured, and **assembled in-house**, which means:

1. Vertical integration reduces dependency on low-margin commodity components
2. Custom bundles let SMCI charge more for value-added services
3. Standardization improves yield, reduces warranty risk, and shortens labor cycles

**3. Faster Time-to-Deployment = Premium Pricing Power**

SMCI can ship **fully integrated, plug-and-play racks in 3–4 weeks**, while others take 8–12 weeks+ with multiple vendors.

For hyperscalers and AI startups racing to bring GPU clusters online, this **speed translates into willingness to pay more**, or at least not negotiate down.

For example: A customer buying a $2.5M rack from SMCI may avoid:

* Extra $500k/month in AI cloud rental costs
* 3–4 month delay in deploying AI training models
* Facility delays in retrofitting for traditional HVAC-based servers

Below is a table below comparing liquid-cooled racks Time-to-Deployment between SMCI and its competitors:

|**Vendor**|**Liquid-Cooled Rack Output (Est.)**|**Time to Deployment**|**Notes**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**SMCI**|**\~2,000+ racks/month**|**3–4 weeks** (from factory)|DCBBS fully integrated, scalable, Blackwell-ready|
|**Dell**|*Unknown (not disclosed)*|\~6–10 weeks (unverified)|IR7000 liquid-cooled racks for hyperscalers, but no output figures released|
|**HPE**|*Limited modular deployments*|\~8–12 weeks (pods)|Offers liquid-cooled AI systems (e.g. Cray EX, Apollo), but mostly for supercomputing clients|
|**Lenovo**|*Unknown*|6+ weeks (via FIS programs)|Neptune liquid cooling, but most integration is not turnkey at SMCI pace|

This “time-value” premium enhances margin per contract.

**4. Liquid Cooling = Lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for Clients**

Clients benefit from:

* 30–50%+ reduction in power usage (no fans/blowers at server level)
* Higher rack density → fewer racks → less real estate
* Reduced HVAC burden → capex + opex savings

Because DCBBS racks are pre-validated and ready for 80–100+ kW loads, customers can safely go denser per rack — which:

* Makes SMCI’s per-rack offering more economically valuable
* Lets them preserve pricing vs. air-cooled OEMs like Lenovo, HPE, or Dell, who may cut prices to remain competitive

Higher value-to-customer means more pricing power = higher gross margin

**5. Operational Efficiency at Scale**

SMCI is building out:

* A 3 million square foot manufacturing campus in Silicon Valley and Malaysia
* A supply chain optimized for GPU pre-allocation, liquid cooling parts, and just-in-time rack assembly

This allows SMCI to:

* Mass produce racks with minimal retooling
* Reduce per-rack cost at high volume
* Use contract-based repeat orders (like the DataVolt $20B deal) to plan capacity

Economies of scale + predictable assembly processes = declining cost/unit → rising margin

Below is a comparison table illustrating the margin impact:

|**Advantage**|**Margin Impact**|
|:-|:-|
|High ASP per rack|Higher gross profit in dollar terms|
|Bundled hardware/services|Increases perceived value + vertical profit|
|Speed to deploy (3-4 weeks)|Pricing premium vs. slower OEMs|
|Energy/cooling savings for customer|Improves TCO → preserves SMCI pricing power|
|Factory integration at scale|Lowers per-rack cost with volume|

So far, we've learned how DCBBS can substantially decrease build times for customers and how it could potentially increase margins for SMCI.

Now to the fun part: The UAE Deal

After doing some ape fisted carpet eating math, I estimate that the total cost of the 5GW AI Campus would be about $125 billion (assuming **each rack** draws about 100kW and sells for $2.5 million). Based on these numbers, I had ChatGPT build a table with a break down of what SMCI would get based on various percentages of the project they would be responsible for and superimposed a likelihood of occurrence formula in there:

|Coverage %|Likelihood of Occurrence|Racks Provided|G42 Total Payment to SMCI|Estimated Gross Profit (USD) 9.7%|Estimated EBITDA (USD)|Estimated EPS|Implied Share Price (@20x PE)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1%|Highly Likely (90%)|500|$1,250,000,000|$121,250,000|$103,062,500|$1.87|$37.40|
|2%|Very Likely (80%)|1000|$2,500,000,000|$242,500,000|$206,125,000|$3.75|$75.00|
|5%|Likely (65%)|2500|$6,250,000,000|$606,250,000|$515,312,500|$9.37|$187.40|
|10%|Possible (45%)|5000|$12,500,000,000|$1,212,500,000|$1,030,625,000|$18.74|$374.80|
|25%|Plausible (25%)|12500|$31,250,000,000|$3,031,250,000|$2,576,562,500|$46.84|$936.80|
|50%|Unlikely (10%)|25000|$62,500,000,000|$6,062,500,000|$5,153,125,000|$93.70|$1,874.00|
|100%|Very Unlikely (3%)|50000|$125,000,000,000|$12,125,000,000|$10,306,250,000|$187.40|$3,748.00|

As you can see, even with a conservative PE of 20x and 9.7% margins, if SMCI gets even 2-5% of the project, thats an EPS of $3.75-9.37 and a share price of $75-187 a share.

**How ChatGPT Calculated the Likelihoods**

This wasn’t a statistical model but rather a strategic probability estimate based on 5 weighted factors:

**1. Historical Precedent (30%)**

* No hyperscaler or government has ever given 100% of a 5GW AI deployment to one vendor.
* Datavolt gave SMCI a $20B deal, but likely part of a larger multi-phase build — suggesting up to 25% is plausible.

**2. Industry Norm for Diversification (25%)**

* Large clients (e.g. AWS, G42, Meta) **split procurement across 2–4 OEMs** for risk mitigation, price leverage, and geopolitical hedging.
* Most national-scale AI campuses split rack-scale work among **Dell, Lenovo, HPE, SMCI, Nvidia integrators**, etc.

**3. SMCI Production Capacity (20%)**

* SMCI can output \~5,000 racks/month total, **2,000+ liquid cooled**.
* To hit 50–100% coverage of a 5GW facility, they’d need to commit 6–12 months of global capacity, which limits probability unless it's multi-year.

**4. Geopolitical Alignment (15%)**

* SMCI already has deep regional partnerships (Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi), so 10–25% is well within reach.
* But **50–100%** would likely require **exclusive national alignment**, which is rare unless the vendor is sovereign or majority-owned.

**5. First-Mover Advantage &amp; Time-to-Deploy (10%)**

* SMCI’s lead time (3–4 weeks vs. 8–12 weeks) is a massive advantage.
* For urgency-sensitive contracts, this could **justify awarding 25% or more** — but not 100%, barring a disruption in Dell/HPE supply.

I think its also important to add, two job listenings have been posted for positions in Abu Dhabi:

[Account Sales Manager](https://jobs.supermicro.com/job/United-Arab-Emirates-Abu-Dha-Sales-Account-Manager/1148026500/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

[Technology Enablement Engineer](https://jobs.supermicro.com/job/United-Arab-Emirates-Abu-Dha-Technology-Enablement-Engineer/1246502400/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)



All in all, SMCI could stand to make a assload of money from a G42 UAE deal.

Last but not least, Cramer is [“Sick of”](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/jim-cramer-is-sick-of-super-micro-computer-stock-should-you-sell-smci-now/ar-AA1F0NkN?ocid=finance-verthp-feeds) SMCI

  
TL:DR: SMCI provides the fastest Time-to-Deployment of any of its competitors with its liquid-cooled DCBBS solution and this could help increase margins overtime and make it a more attractive buy to larger customers ready to deploy immediately. Capturing even 5% of the G42 UAE deal could result in a share price of $180+ a share. SMCI is already hiring for positions in Abu Dhabi.

226,NVDA,Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang Is Set to Speak at Computex Sunday—What You Need To Know,"Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang is set to take the stage this Sunday at Computex, an annual technology trade show, with this year’s theme—“AI Next”—focused squarely on the emerging technology that has lately powered growth in the company's business.

Huang’s keynote, which will be livestreamed from Taipei’s Music Center at 11 p.m. ET Sunday, is expected to highlight Nvidia’s latest advances, and may bring announcements of new partnerships.

Shares of the AI chipmaker’s stock were little changed Friday. They’ve added roughly 15% this week as a Saudi Arabian partnership announced Tuesday during President Donald Trump's trip to the Middle East raised hopes for future deals. The recent gains have helped Nvidia shares edge back into positive territory for the year. The potential for new announcements at Computex could present another catalyst for the stock, along with the company's first-quarter earnings report due May 28.

At last year’s Computex, Nvidia had announced the successor to its Blackwell AI chip, known as Rubin, sending shares higher. Huang in March said Rubin is still set to launch in 2026.

""We would expect relatively positive news on the AI front out of Computex next week,"" Wedbush analysts told clients in a note Friday.

Other chipmakers are also scheduled to present later in the week, with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) set to showcase its latest developments on Tuesday.

236,NVDA,"US Weighs Letting UAE Buy Over a Million Advanced Nvidia Chips, Bloomberg News Reports","No paywall: [https://money.usnews.com/investing/news/articles/2025-05-13/us-weighs-letting-uae-buy-over-a-million-advanced-nvidia-chips-bloomberg-news-reports](https://money.usnews.com/investing/news/articles/2025-05-13/us-weighs-letting-uae-buy-over-a-million-advanced-nvidia-chips-bloomberg-news-reports)

(Reuters) - The Trump administration is weighing a deal that would allow the UAE to import more than a million advanced Nvidia chips, a quantity that far exceeds limits under Biden-era AI chip regulations, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday.

The deal, which is still being negotiated and could change, would let the UAE import 500,000 of the most advanced chips on the market each year from now to 2027, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.

While one-fifth would be set aside for the Abu Dhabi AI firm G42, the rest will go to U.S. companies building data centers in the Gulf nation, according to the report.

ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, which may announce new data-center capacity in the UAE as soon as this week, could be one of those companies, the report said.

The report comes on the heels of U.S. President Donald Trump securing a $600 billion commitment from Saudi Arabia to invest in the United States.

The Department of Commerce and OpenAI did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment, while Nvidia declined to comment.

Abu Dhabi's artificial intelligence push has mostly been led by state-backed G42, which has drawn increased scrutiny from China hawks in Washington amid fears that the UAE is becoming a conduit for China to receive advanced American AI technology it is blocked from getting directly from the U.S.

According to the Bloomberg report, G42 could purchase computing capabilities equivalent to between 1 million and 1.5 million H100 chips over the lifetime of the deal. That is around four times more than it would have been allowed to buy under a Biden-era chip export control framework, known as AI diffusion, it said.

What keeps me up at night is that had I done nothing but hold that position would now as of October be worth over 10x or 1 million+ and had I bought back with that 50k in May it would be up over 100x to 5 million+. Right now trying to get back to 120k from December 2024 value, and bought back IREN call options in September.**

Down but not out. I YOLOD on call options for IREN (Iris Energy) last year and traded from 30k to 130k peak last December before watching it crater. \*Sorry I did hundreds of day trades so there is no one trade to show.\* Was wondering whether to cut my losses when it dropped to 100k in January but kept holding until I finally got out at around 50k. I was trading those 2026 Jan 25 strike call options in the 3 range and then they went 0.1 to 0.2 in April. IREN went from 15 to 6, as low as 5. I got out when they were down 60% so could have been far worse. **IREN is 27+, now 50+, and I didn't check the call options but they must be 4+ by now if not 6+...if not 20+. I could have turned that 130k from December 3 average on the Jan 2026 25 strike by doing absolutely nothing into 1 million plus. If I had bought that April bottom back would be up from 50k to 5+ million. I now lose sleep at night thinking what could have been.**

**August 2025 Account:**

https://preview.redd.it/y5fgrsrpjbmf1.png?width=1524&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=758c898c77f872c85d69212c3420caf9882efd6f

I went from 130k worth of IREN 25 strike 2026 Call options to a 60% loss selling them at 1 from 3, then buying Sol Strategies at 3-4 in March only to be down to 1 another 70% loss. I then added some additional funds and took an instant 25% loss on BMNR. The account went from 130k in December to 14k in August at the low, and I added another 10k which is why it shows around 24k. The loss was 60% by selling IREN at the lows December to March, and then another 70% drop buying Sol Strategies at the highs in March and round tripping twice from high of 4 to low 1 back to new lows 1. The additional 10k in cash was from additional distributions I had from CORZ Core Scientific which were air dropped in my account.

I debated going all in on the Coreweave IPO but decided not to since it looked like if was flop in the 30s and NVIDIA had to bail them out in April. A few months later it pumped to 160+ now around 100+.

So instead, I then got Sol Strategies, HODL CYFRF CYFRD (now STKE) which cratered from the 3-4 range to 1, March to April. It then went back up to 4+ in May and I aped it and doubled down at 4+. And right after that it cratered to 1 and got reverse split 8:1 which makes it about 10 now (my average was 30 from May pre split). I got rekt so now down another 70%. I'm bad at math but what's 130k down 60% and the down 70% on 50k? Whatever it is that's what's left, plus another 10k or so added in cash. I finally capitulated and sold Sol Strategies between 9 and and 10 in September.

P.S. I am the guy who had CORZZ Core Scientific penny warrants from 1, with 70k worth when it was 3, and panic sold at low 2 last April 2024...they then went to 10+ by summer and 18 by the fall and I had expected a potential move to 10 by fall, but had weak hands since sold in the 2s. Then chased it back up with options and made some back.

**Never give up, you can always make it back, but stay away Canadian companies because they are pump and dumps (referring to Sol Strategies). Even if you are right about the general direction of the market you will still get rekt if you pick the wrong thing or have the wrong timing. Also stay away from treasury companies like BMNR, STKE, and SBET.**

**Lesson 1: If you have a high conviction play, average down and double down if crashes short term. Let the trade run it's thesis. That was my mistake.** I should have bought back those IREN call options at the lows and waited until the late summer. Imagine that 130k buying those Jan 2026 25 strikes at 0.1 to 0.3 which are now up literally over 10000% or 100x, with IREN being 50+. Even holding my original position in the 3s would be a 10x by now. I could have made 1 million to 5 million by simply holding a few more months even during a 90%+ crash. Sometimes the best thing to do is nothing, but only if it's a winner high conviction play.

**Lesson 2: Do not touch treasury companies as they dilute.** And never touch Canadian treasury companies like Sol Strategies for the same reason. They are penny stocks and insiders will dump on retail at the highs. Canadian markets do not have the volume or cash to sustain momentum so Canadian tech plays crash from a peak and never recover. There is also no Canadian federal regulator like the SEC so there is lots of insider day trading going on. Sol Strategies STKE went from 40+ in January, to 30+ in May to now barely 5. Solana was higher but Sol Strategies never recovered and the CEO sold shares and left. One of the majority holders was the former Board Chairman who is an Eastern European Poker Player based in Dubai who dumped shares on retail all year long form 40+ to 5.

**Lesson 3: Always look for other opportunities and remember you can make it all back in one trade!** Examples of this are IREN's move from 5 to 50+ in 6 months, and others like the Coreweave IPO 30 to 150+.

**Lesson 4: AI is the future! I now believe the AI thesis is the future combined with crypto.** The right AI plays will have exponential growth and can do literally 10 to 100x gains. IREN is the best example of this for 2025.

**Lesson 5: History rhymes. AI/crypto stocks tend to pump in the summer and year end Nov/Dec, and crash around April.** Markets pump after rate cuts starting in September and especially tech and crypto (see fall of 2021). Announcements of big contracts like Coreweave and CORZ had pumped the stocks multiples within months 3-4x. Things tend to cool off and sell off from mid December to April, with April usually being the lows. This happened both in 2021, 2024 and 2025.

**Next Steps as of August 2025:** I will take what is left about 15k (from 130k) plus another 10k in cash and go all on IREN call options for January 2027 various strikes (35, 40, 45, 50, 70), as I now realize IREN is going to be the next Coreweave 30 to 100-150 target.

**Big Mistake:** I should have bought back the IREN call options at the lows as they hit new highs after going from 3 to 0.1 to 4+, 5+ 6+ etc. I got rekt selling the lows and buying a pump and dump Canadian Solana treasury penny stock and now have 20k left after losing 60% on IREN and another 70% on Sol Strategies AND adding 10k in cash from CORZ additional distributions that were air dropped from old CORZQ holdings. I will YOLO ALL IN on IREN call options Jan 2027 expiry hoping for that 100+ moonshot and a 10x Coreweave style. It could happen by looking at the Coreweave chart as IREN expands AI and buys more GPUs with increases revenue guidance. The new NVIDIA partnership is a tell. IREN should catch up to Nebius and Coreweave in market cap in 2026 which means 100-200 price target or higher by 2027.

**I am now looking to the future and betting everything I have left and then some on IREN CALL OPTIONS with some CIFR and I do believe I can make it all back by December or at least get back to 120k account total. I believe by year end IREN should be around 70-80 which will make me whole again. It could be a lot higher into 2026 like 100+ since Coreweave went from 30 to 160 within months. At least they should be catching up to Nebius market cap.**

**Update August 2025: HODL CYFRF CYFRD Sol Strategies cratered in April and then recovered by May. I tried day trading it but long story short it cratered again and did a reverse split 8:1, and the NASDAQ finally happened in September. Meanwhile IREN pumped to 27 and those call options after being as low as 0.1 recovered to new highs of 4+. Of course I sold them in the 1s from 3s, and after being down 60% now down another 70% on Sol Strategies. Went from 130k to less than 20k. Will take what is left and go all in plus some more added on IREN call options for January 2027 as I now realize IREN is going to be the next Coreweave 30s to 150 target.**

**TLDR: I should have bought back the IREN call options at the lows as they hit new highs after going from 3 to 0.1 to 4+, 5+ etc. I got rekt selling the lows and buying a pump and dump Canadian Solana treasury penny stock and now have 20k left after losing 60% on IREN and another 70% on Sol Strategies. I will YOLO ALL IN on IREN call options for Jan 2027 hoping for that 100+ moonshot and a 10x. It could happen by looking at the Coreweave chart.**

**UPDATE OCTOBER 3, 2025: Slowly making it back total account positions back around 70k (main account plus a small secondary one not shown. The lowest low was in July at under 20k.**

**Full Disclosure: Positions as of October 3, 2025, entered earlier in September. I intend to keep these until mid-December. I also have a second smaller day trading account with about 10k current value and some IREN Jan 2027 50 strike calls. On the smaller account I tried day trading CIFR and IREN call options. The screenshots are all from the main account.**

Sol Strategies HODL CYFRF now STKE was listed on NASDAQ, then cratered 50% same day, then fell another 50% since. I sold the day before the listing was announced and it's now down another 50%. Never ever invest in Canadian tech stocks or treasury companies. I was down 80% since May on it by the time I sold beginning of September. Switched everything to IREN and some CIFR call options. Tried day trading IREN a bit and missed that jump from 25-27 range to 31-33 (was fully in at 27 but then sold out before the OTM call options jumped big the same day and the next day, then panic bought higher in the low 30s so missed another 40% move in 2 days). Fully in now since that 31-33 range in September.

**TLDR: Account has recovered back to over the May peak value, now about 60k in the main account and another 10k in a secondary account. 90% in IREN 2027 January call options, and 10% in some CIFR and Bitfarms call options just in case they go parabolic. I expect IREN to be 70+ by December, possibly closing in on 100. Eventually in 2026 IREN should catch up to Coreweave and Nebius (150+, 200+ target prices) as they announce more GPU purchases and sites come online. The way to go is the neo cloud AI scaler not colocation because that will get a much higher premium for compute. I don't expect a colocation deal anymore but instead rapid expansion of GPU purchases and large jumps in recurring revenue guidance leading to repricing in line with Nebius and then Coreweave.**

**What keeps me up at night is that had I done nothing but hold that position it would now as of October be worth over 10x or 1 million+ and had I bought back with that 50k in May it would be up over 100x to 5 million+. Right now trying to get back to 120k from December 2024 value, and bought back IREN call options in September.**

**October 6, 2025 Update:**  90% in IREN call options, some in CIFR. Still holding until December.

246,NVDA,Everything about AMD's earnings tonight,"Okay guys, AMD will report its first quarter earnings after the bell on Tuesday. What are we gonna do? See, I'm the concern about the impact of Trump’s tariffs on chip sales and the health of the AI market ahead of Nvidia’s (NVDA) earnings later this month.

For those who have been paying attention, AMD’s announcement follows rival Intel’s (INTC) report, which saw the company beat on the top and bottom lines but issue lighter-than-anticipated revenue guidance in the second quarter. At the time, Intel CFO David Zinsner blamed the “current macro environment” for creating “elevated uncertainty across the industry.”

PC makers produce a number of their products in China, as well as Vietnam and Malaysia. Computers are currently exempt from Trump’s tariffs, but the administration has said it could implement duties on semiconductors based on the results of the Commerce Department’s Section 232 investigation.

For the quarter, AMD is expected to report adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.94 on revenue of $7.1 billion. The company saw EPS of $0.62 and revenue of $5.4 billion in the same quarter last year. Data Center segment revenue is expected to bring in $3.6 billion in the quarter compared to $2.3 billion last year.

In April, AMD, like Nvidia, announced that the Trump administration instituted tighter export controls on AI chips destined for China. The move effectively cuts off AMD’s ability to ship its MI308 AI processor to the region, and, according to the company, might result in as much as an $800 million charge on inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves. And that could weigh on the company’s Q2 outlook.

I expect AMD to post higher results but guide lower given 1Q strength for MI308. Longer term, this might be a good thing in 2Q with the AI chip ban into China.

For those following AI stocks, you may have noticed them taking a major hit over the past few months on fears that the trade has been overhyped. DeepSeek’s January announcement that it managed to produce high-performance AI models using less than top-of-the-line chips further hammered chip stocks.

Shares of AMD are off 18% year to date and 36% over the last 12 months. Nvidia is down 15% year to date, but still up 22% over the last year.

Unfortunately for AMD the AI story (which is already somewhat tenuous) is likely to drop further on the back of new China sanctions. 

[Chart](https://i.imgur.com/4PdTT1Q.png)

AI chip companies with to deal with the government's AI diffusion rules, which would require certain countries to acquire special licenses to gain access to a limited number of US AI chips.

AMD’s Client segment, which includes revenue from the sale of laptop and desktop chips, is expected to generate $2 billion in revenue, up from $1.3 billion in Q1 last year. There’s the potential that the company could report that it saw a pull forward in sales leading up to Trump’s April 2 tariff announcements.

From what I've read, the core PC business appears to be exposed to channel effects (client shipments last quarter were higher than the peak of the COVID bubble already).

AMD’s gaming business, which includes sales of GPUs and semi-custom chips for video game consoles, is expected to bring in $540 million, a 41% year-over-year decline from the same quarter last year. It's only recently that the Ryzen biz has pivoted from hardcore HPC parts, such as the Instinct MI250-series used in the United States' first exascale supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, to parts competitive with Nvidia for lower-precision AI applications. When it launched, the MI300X boasted up to 32 percent higher performance in certain AI workloads compared to Nvidia's then-flagship the H100, along with more than double the memory and significantly greater bandwidth. 

Sony's (SONY) and Microsoft’s (MSFT) consoles are approaching the second half of their life cycles, which generally means sales slide versus when they initially hit the market. Companies are also raising prices on the systems to contend with tariffs. Sony has increased the price of its PlayStation in Europe, but not in the US. Consoles aren’t exempt from duties like laptops and desktops. As a result, Microsoft announced it is raising the price of its Xbox Series X by $100 to $599. The company also said it’s raising the price of some of its first-party games to $79 from $69.

248,NVDA,Semi-analysis report on $GOOGL TpU dominance - Nvida &amp; OpenAi at risk!,"Hey folks- happy Thanksgiving!

Semi-analysis ( leading research lab in semiconductors and Ai) have just published a report on the hot topic.

$GOOGL TpU vs $Nvida GpU. They have done the cost comparison and reporting and some crazy things came out of it!

- Google software revamp to make it easier for companies to onboard chips.

- This becomes a huge threat to Nvida as Cuda system is no longer the only monopoly for Ai chips.

- Pricing for TpU is extremely cheap! At the 9k standard rack size, Google TpU are 2x cheaper then nvida Gpu.

- what does this mean for GPU users? Google tpu will crush with margins. They are so cheap that Google cloud is becoming the go to cloud provider for companies as the pricing is just unbeatable. 

- nvida will most likely see margin compression to 60% in the next year or 2 as they need to start to under price to compete with TpU if Google floods the market.

- OpenAi is in huge trouble. They have billions in commitments and billions in deployed GPU. But the price difference means they will see bad/negative margins for a while. Almost 1/2 trillion in losses for the next 5 years. Compute is expensive &amp; seems like Google has cracked the code with TpU.

- NeoClouds have been approached by Google and some have started to deploy the TpU at scale for cloud hosting. Initial trials to see how market response is. Other large customer amd contracts that have been rumored for $GOOGL is $META &amp; Xai. Both who are huge nvida customers! 


This news will be digested over the weekend but my positions are set on this. I am in a pair trade with long $GOOGL shares + $AVGO calls and short on $NVDA/$AMD.
It does seem like googles full stack approach is working well and we are seeing gemini take on other world models, Google cloud ☁️ dominance over Aws/AZURE and then ToU taking market share from Nvida. Firing in on all fronts.

251,NVDA,My high conviction trade of the year: Full ported into META calls (looking good on both ends: technical and fundamental),"TLDR:
Macro: Risk on sentiment + rate cut buy the rumor repricing + end of year FOMO/FOMU trade 

Technical: price reclaiming 600s and hitting EMA + crypto/small cap rally hints a good possibility that market is risk on again.

Fundamentals: META’s valuation now might be considered expensive in a bear market, BUT it’s a bull market now and META is CHEAP!

And position and trade plan at bottom.


—————————————————————-

Buying into strength today as META has reclaimed the 600 level and touching EMA. 

Market sentiment is also recovering as we are getting back to risk on. (Crypto and small cap rally is a good indicator) 

On top of that the rate cut sentiment is coming on again. With the fed in trumps hands, it’s really unlikely that a cut won’t happen so I definitely will buy into a fed cut induced rally (and my prediction is this rally will continue into fomc week with a sell the news event following the cut &amp; market end off the year with a rally). 

This makes me believe that the year end FOMO and FOMU trade is back on again. Where portfolio managers go long on mag 7 or AI names that are underperforming ytd with hopes of a catch up trade.

Fundamentally, META is not cheap but certainly not expensive here:

EV to EBITDA: sub 15x (it’s almost half as cheap as GOOG here - I agree GOOG is a much better business but 50% discount in a bull market riding the AI secular trend? I call this deep fucking value)

also, META trades at 35x FCF. This may seem expensive if you are value investor. But again, we are in a bull market (so story drives price growth, not valuations) plus META has the first mover advantage in the AI secular trend and is still founder led. So I’d argue they deserve a premium and I say this valuation is more than justified here. And let’s compare other mag 7: GOOG 53x FCF, MSFT 45x FCF, AMZN 232x FCF, NVDA 58x FCF. So yeah it’s deep fucking value here. 

Price Target: If we are being conservative here and have META touch its previous valuation highs of ~42x FCF, the price will be $725. (A 20% upside)

PE ratio is pointless as different companies have different capital structures plus it doesn’t work on high growth names so I just look at EV EBITDA and P to FCF instead.


Position &amp; Game plan:

2026 April $700 call a few METU calls across different accounts with May 2026 expirations.

As my modest target price is $725, I’ll be writing month out covered calls with strike above my target to offset some theta and lower my cost basis. 

As for take profit and exits, I will exit around late Jan - mid Fed to avoid theta decay acceleration. If META goes above $700, I will monitor the position closely and exit the trade as soon as day candle breaks below EMA. 

Stop loss: I’ll exit if META breaks below 570, in which case I’ll wait for April lows and then get back in again.

252,NVDA,NVDA Chip Obsolescence,"One of the talking points in the argument that we are in an AI bubble is that NVDA chips supposedly have a shorter useful life than NVDA claims.  I don’t understand this argument.  Even assuming that NVDA chips have a shorter useful life, why would that signal an AI bubble?  Wouldn’t the fact that NVDA is turning out faster and more economical chips that make older chips obsolete mean that NVDA will have a greatly extended period of high demand for its next generation of chips?  And on the buy side, wouldn’t the fact that new chips coming out are better and cheaper argue for expansion of the market for so services (services doing more and costing less)?

I can see a problem for an overleveraged data center that doesn’t have cash flow to meet debt service and upgrade — but isn’t that a limited problem and not an indication of a bubble?

Can anyone explain why chip obsolescence is supposed to be a sign that the AI trade is at risk?

I used to work as an engineer in a highly competitive (but also technical) sport. It’s where I witnessed how powerful the Red Queen hypothesis is. In evolutionary biology, the Red Queen hypothesis proposes that organisms must constantly adapt and evolve just to maintain their current fitness in a rapidly changing environment. In sport, this means that every new piece of equipment that confers an advantage eventually becomes table stakes. In business, the metaphor fits companies that offer a technology to a hyper-competitive industry that is seen as an “unfair advantage”. Those that don’t adopt fast enough get left behind. Ten baggers are the companies that create and embed an advantage so powerful that their technology becomes necessary rather than optional for survival in the competitive arena.

Think about NVDA and the AI arms race:

A company builds a technology that rivals cannot easily replicate and that customers must adopt to keep up.

Over time, keeping up becomes, in effect, the bare minimum and those who lag pay a price (either margin pressure, share loss or extinction).

The industry’s motion forces everyone to “run faster” just to stay in place; the “winner” runs ahead and thus outpaces everyone else, like the Red Queen’s race.

For shareholders, this dynamic can produce sustained growth, margin expansion and ultimately multi-bag returns when the market begins to price in the inevitability of dominance.

To use this as a filter for finding a potential “next NVDA,” one should ask:

Is the company offering a true step-change technological advantage?

Is the advantage serving a high-stakes, high-volume industry where the cost of not adopting is meaningful?

Are there structural tailwinds (regulatory, geopolitical, market) that make adoption likely and widespread?

Are there barriers to entry (patents, manufacturing scale, regulatory approvals, systems integration)?

Can the company transition from early-proof to scale production to cash-flow positive?

When these align, the company and its products shift from nice to have must have, and if you can time the inflection, the upside can be dramatic.


Why I think this is where AMPX (Amprius Technologies, Inc.) and the Drone Market stand today

Let’s walk through how AMPX fits this Red Queen model, focusing on the drone / unmanned aerial systems (UAS) sector, which is undergoing a structural shift.

Unfair advantage: high-energy-density silicon-anode batteries
Amprius has developed silicon-anode lithium-ion cells (its SiCore® platform) that deliver very high energy density (cited at ~450 Wh/kg) and are shipping to drone / UAS customers.   The advantage: for drones, endurance, power-to-weight ratio, reliability in demanding environments all matter. A battery that lets a drone fly longer, carry more, or operate in harsher conditions becomes a competitive differentiator.

To give you a practical sense of how much of an advantage these batteries are: Nordic Wing (a recently announced customer) claimed that these batteries increased flight time by 90%. Nearly double. If you’ve ever flown a drone: flight time is a major limitation and a doubling is an unfair advantage.

The thesis: If military/commercial drone OEMs adopt Amprius’ cells as a required component to stay competitive (i.e., “we must use this battery tech or our drone cannot keep up”), then Amprius may be in a position to become a “must-supplier” in a fast-moving industry.

Industry: drones / defence procurement is entering a leap

Lots has been written about drones on WSB so I won’t go too deep into the industry details. I would only go into one headline that you may have missed because you were too busy mourning your ports:

The United States Army recently announced that it is targeting procurement of at least one million drones over the next 2-3 years compared to its current rate of ~50 000/year.  This is not the “10-20% CAGR” that analysts have been modeling. This is a tenfold increase. 

The drone industry is not just growing, but entering a step-change in scale and procurement behaviour. In such environments, component suppliers that supply the “secret sauce” tech (like high-density batteries) can benefit disproportionately.

Fit: Amprius meets the criteria
AMPX is shipping cells to advanced drone customers and already qualified some of its modules for leading defense tech.

The company claims partnerships and orders from UAS manufacturers (e.g., a recent ~$35 million follow-on purchase order from a drone customer).  

The tech has meaningful performance claims (450 Wh/kg, long-endurance drones) that allow drone makers to differentiate.  

The addressable market is large and rising, and procurement cycles are shifting from “nice” to “need.”

Because the advantage is embedded in a complex hardware component (battery chemistry + manufacturing scale + safety + certification) it is harder to replicate quickly.

Where the “Red Queen” effect kicks in
Drone OEMs and militaries are under pressure: adversaries are using expendable drones, swarms, long-duration UAS, etc. To keep up, incumbents must adopt superior batteries, sensors, autonomy, etc. Amprius’ tech thus becomes not just a bonus, but potentially part of the minimum standard to compete. That means the company might avoid being just another supplier and instead become a foundational supplier: giving it leverage on pricing, margins and volume.

If the transition from “prototype” to “volume orders” happens (and Amprius seems to be making that move), then the stock might see the kind of multi-bag move one hopes for when the market re-rates based on future dominance.

BuT tHe sToCK Is AlrEAdY uP:

Yes, yes, the stock has run. I actually tried to post about it late last year but it was under the allowable market cap. This is a real company: and real companies can continue to go up if earnings back it up. Here are some numbers to back valuations:

Q3 2025 (ended Sept 30) revenue: $21m. EPS of –$0.03 vs –$0.06 estimate.  

Growth: This was a ~42% quarter-on-quarter increase and ~173% year-over-year (for the quarter)
Gross margin: The company has reported a positive gross margin ( +15% in Q3) that is expected to expand 
Orders/customers: A ~$35 million order from a recurring drone customer.  80 customers added in Q3 and $53m in backlog orders.

Production capacity: The firm has stated ~1.8 gigawatt hours of capacity through partners.  This translates to $1-2B of revenue at full capacity. 

Conservative profitability scenario:
Let’s assume the following:

Revenue for full year 2026 grows, not exponentially, but moderately (say ~100% vs 2025). If 2025 full-year revenue ends up around ~$75m (given Q1-Q3 numbers and ramp), then 2026 might hit ~$140-200m in revenue.
At say a 15% gross margin (which is already achieved  and is expected to expand), and modest operating expense growth, the company could move from net loss to near breakeven or modest profit. In Q1 or Q2 2026.

Given the order backlog and ramp in drone battery shipments, the margin expansion may happen without assuming extraordinary growth.

In other words: if the market begins to believe that Amprius can deliver $150m+ revenue with 15%+ gross margin, then the path to profitability seems credible and that tends to shift the valuation multiple upward (especially for a “must-supplier” in a fast growth market). Even if the company is not free-cash-flow positive today, the market will begin to treat it as more than an R&amp;D story.  

Risks: standard and obvious. Company is not profitable yet. (It has also been stuck in a momentum basket which has made it quite volatile, though it seems to be losing tracking now)

Summary &amp; PT

Without getting too deep into the numbers: having been on earnings calls and seen analyst PTs and modeling a small increase in growth, my 2026 PT is $25. (This is a tenbagger from when I first got in, sorry) though I’ve added at $7 and again at $11. There is no reason, should they continue to execute, that AMPX can’t be a 5-10B company.

Position attached plus another 2k shares in an account I can’t see online (you’ll have to take my word for it)

Putting it all together: The Red Queen lens tells us: look for companies whose advantage becomes a baseline “must have” in a fast-moving market.

Amprius appears to fit: high-density silicon-anode batteries, serving drone/UAS manufacturers in an environment where drones are rapidly becoming indispensable.

Macro tailwinds are strong: military procurement of drones is ramping (US Army, executive orders, etc), the global drone market is growing, domestic supply-chain shifts favour US-based component providers. Personally, on a macro level, I think monetary and fiscal policy will be pro-risk asset in the beginning of 2026 as well.

If the market begins to price in that Amprius will be the dominant supplier (or among the few key suppliers) to the drone industry, then the valuation upside could be meaningful. The key is timing the inflection from “growth story” to “earnings story” once profitability (or credible path to profitability) is visible, the multiple expansion often follows.

Hang in there, and see you in Valhalla.

259,NVDA,5600% Gains with Options,"Been investing with bi-weekly every time i received my paycheck for the last 5 years. Was just DCA'ing with no care about prices.

Studied options and did paper trading for about 1.5years. Was able to turn 10k into 45k after a year with fake money.

Decided to do options this year in my non-registered account around May. Started with $1000, and was doing 0dte calls and puts on NVDA and brought it to about $2400. Then got screwed by the Israel/iran war thinking oil was going to moon by full porting into oil stocks and there was a ceasefire immediately and my shit crashed hard. I was down to $400 and i almost said screw it options are not for me. Told myself to go again, but not to invest with emotion or get into hype. Used that as my first lesson to not fomo or trade around the news or hype, market is irrational.

I then put another $1700 in my non-registered account over June and July and made some leaps. Googl, AMD, NVDA,, NBIS, IREN, BABA, bidu, Amzn, MU, UNH and was doing Tesla puts and calls for weeks in August-September cause it kept going up and down every week like clockwork. I did have a leap on Tesla that i had which i sold after it broke above 400. My account slowly grew, i took profits too early on google when it first broke 207 as well as MU, and missed out on so much gains before jumping back in at 230 with Googl. Got really lucky with AMD as i had about 20k of leaps (10 contracts) i first bought when it dipped below 160 and DCA'd up in August and held until it hit 212. Sold 7 of my contracts and still holding the other 3.

I also bag held so many of these for months without paper handing. For example Oct 10, and this whole last week really tested my nerves, but had to take a step back and stick with my conviction and price targets. I knew it was temporary. Shit might dip again and this might just be a bull trap, but fuck it yolo. Get rich or die trying. I'm likely closing most of my positions by end of this month/beginning of December or once this account gets to $200k (whichever is sooner).

Every time i sold a position, i used that money to reinvest mostly in AMD and NVDA calls/leaps. UNH i had to close some of my positions at a loss but overall it was net profits with my UNH leaps. It just sucks cause i was up so much before Oct 28 and had so many calls in UNH :(

I know i am incredibly lucky

**EDIT for more info, Since this is getting eyeballs and people are asking:**

I’ve been trading for 10 years now. Not rich, not homeless... just a dude who has made every possible mistake, occasionally hit something real, and then promptly fumbled the bag again.

Some highlights along the way:

---

#### ASTS

I found ASTS way back during the SPAC era. I bought before it had a ticker, before the hype, before Reddit even knew what space-based 5G was.

I spent 5 years accumulating. Over 10,000 shares, plus a stupid amount of calls. My average cost was around $4.

I held through it all

* Dilution
* Missed launches
* “We swear the network is live” investor calls
* The CEO looking like he was aging in dog years

Then 2024 came. I had lost faith. I sold basically everything for a tiny loss. That position would be worth over $1,000,000 today.

Instead I took like a $3k loss.

---

#### NVDA

I got in on the first AI run-up, not the late one.

Bought $17,000 worth of $100 strike calls mid/late-March 2024.
Expiration was April. And so it began.

NVDA was unstoppable. Every day I kept thinking, this can't continue... until it reached a point where it was more like, now that's its surpassed a threshold, this can't NOT continue. I bought. It stopped its rocketship upwards almost immediately. But I had faith as I watched my options half, and then half again. Hell, I bought more. At a certain point, I just said screw it, I'm seeing this through, all or nothing. 

And it DID finally go up. But it didn’t go up-up until shortly AFTER my expiration.

I lost it.

If I had rolled them out THREE WEEKS at the low point: The profit would have been over $100k.
I didn’t roll. I just stared and let time decay eat my soul.

---

#### GME

Yes. I was there. That big spikey spike you see right before the endless dropping. That's it. But I wanted more.
So I bought more. I bought the top. Sold the bottom. Bought back in. Sold lower. Repeated like a lab rat pressing a dopamine button.

---

#### ETH 

My biggest regret. It's not in the chart but a friend of mine got me on crypto early. I bought around 2,000 ETH at like $17. That would be OVER SIX MILLION today. I did actually make a profit of like $30k here, and at the time I was rather pleased with myself.

OVER SIX MILLION if I had held. ALMOST SEVEN. At today's price, $6,799,680.

---


#### Other Notable Trades / Character Development Moments

* Random biotech phase — I turned $4k into $18k and then back to $0 because I “liked the chart.”
* SPY options era — I contributed meaningfully to someone else’s Hamptons house.
* Margin interest that one year:
  My 1099 literally shows I paid $1,800+ in margin interest to Robinhood in 2021.
  I paid interest to lose money.

---

### What I’ve Learned:

* The bag is real, but the bag doesn’t wait.
* If your conviction lasts 5 years but your patience lasts 5 minutes, you are just donating.
* Rolling options is not optional.
* Stop losses are probably a good idea.
* The market rewards psychopaths and people who forget they own things.

---

**TLDR: My portfolio isn’t diversified by sector, it’s diversified by types of bad decisions**.

**TL;DR**

POET, a $500M photonics company sitting with real tech and [patents](https://patents.justia.com/assignee/poet-technologies-inc), makes AI servers move at light speed (literally). The AI arms race can’t scale without faster pipes, and POET is literally selling the pipes. Current market cap is peanuts compared to what it could be if even a fraction of this narrative hits. My play: **Jan 16 2026 $10C** for a clean 5x if we tag $10, and **Jan 15 2027 $10C** for the “retire in shameful glory” 10x+ upside. Not financial advise, assess your own risk.

# Why You Should Even Care About $POET?

Alright you smooth-brained degenerates, put down your $NVDA FDs and listen. There’s a sub-$600M photonics company quietly gearing up to feed the AI data-center monster that everyone keeps screaming about. It’s called **POET Technologies**, ticker **$POET**, and they’re building the plumbing that lets GPUs talk to each other at light speed.

Copper is cooked. Every AI chip out there is choking on data bandwidth. POET shows up like “what if photons, bro?” Their secret sauce is this thing called the **Optical Interposer**, which basically crams light and silicon into one chip so data moves faster, cheaper, and cooler. That’s the entire pitch — light good, heat bad, tendies pending.

**Credit: Read** [this DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1lw1ft3/poet_the_10_bagger_you_dont_know_about/) **for more company details if you are new to $POET**.

# Retard Section Begins Here

If you missed $NVDA, $AMD, $AVGO, this is your redemption arc. We’re still early enough that institutions are only starting to load up. If you like stupid asymmetric returns, please read on. Let’s walk through what’s been dropping in just the last month:

* On **October 28**, they closed a **$150M oversubscribed direct offering**. “Oversubscribed” means people were fighting for shares. The new investors didn’t even get a discount — they paid roughly **$7.25/share**, the same as retail. Institutions don’t throw money at a small-cap photonics play for fun. They see growth. \[[source](https://www.poet-technologies.com/news/poet-technologies-announces-closing-of-us-150-million-oversubscribed-registered-direct-offering-of-common-shares)\]
* On **October 22**, they announced a **$5M production order** for their 800G optical engines. That’s not a prototype, that’s an actual order for actual products. The kind of thing that moves them from “science project” to “revenue story.” \[[source](https://www.poet-technologies.com/news/poet-technologies-receives-5-million-production-order-for-800g-optical-engines)\]
* On **October 7**, another **$75M private investment** landed to scale their AI connectivity business. That’s two major capital events in one month. Most penny semis can’t raise pocket change, these guys raised nearly a quarter billion. \[[source](https://www.poet-technologies.com/news/poet-technologies-announces-closing-of-us-75-million-investment-to-accelerate-growth-in-ai-connectivity-solutions)\]
* They’ve also been stacking partnerships very recently — **Semtech**, **Sivers Semiconductor**, plus a handful of industry awards. This isn’t vapor; these are real names in the optics space that actually matter. \[[source 1](https://www.poet-technologies.com/news/poet-technologies-and-sivers-semiconductors-collaborate-on-external-light-sources-for-co-packaged-optics-and-next-generation-ai-market), [source 2](https://www.poet-technologies.com/news/poet-technologies-and-semtech-launch-1-6t-optical-receivers-for-ai-networks)\]

Put all that together, and you get a company moving from hype to execution faster than most of Wall Street can spell “photonics.”

# Technicals and Sentiment

Yeah, the stock dumped about 30% recently. Before you call that a rug, realize every major bullish catalyst hit after that drop. We’re sitting on the lower band of a clean ascending channel. Historically, that’s where the smart money reloads. DO NOT WALK INTO THE BEAT TRAP. Put your seat belts on and ride with smart money.

The community is waking up too. The $POET subreddit grew from **2k visitors to 10k in a month** — that’s not retail noise, that’s early-phase momentum.

https://preview.redd.it/dpkkujubhvyf1.png?width=2536&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc0c97bfe8db784c96b00eb0b64d25b1c59f6aa8

Option flow backs it up. Last run to $9.41 saw **600k calls traded in a single day**. Current put-call open interest ratio sits around **0.07**, which is stupidly bullish for a small-cap. There are over **780k calls** sitting on open interest right now, and open interest has been steady for months at least since June, not just a one-day gamma spike. An once-in-a-lifetime moment is secretly brewing.

https://preview.redd.it/ut4sjvxchvyf1.png?width=2518&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=febff6ad84a2ba6bdd4347cffa5f92a8fa5677f9

Market makers are hedging in a way that creates a positive **GEX (gamma exposure)** setup — meaning the lower it goes, the more they have to buy. We’re under the $7 put wall and facing the $10 call wall. That means dealers will buy back shares to create their hedge. If price breaks $10, hedging could shove this thing straight to $12 or higher. An 85% return in stock price, or multi-bagger for long calls.

https://preview.redd.it/yeviu27ehvyf1.png?width=2458&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ffb856391db297da1fa6a094426dac3727823841

The main risk of the setup is execution and timing. But given the current slew of great news, I'm confident that we are on a very good track.

# Market Tailwinds

Now here’s where it gets even spicier. The macro setup is starting to line up for small-cap revenge season:

* **November is historically a strong month** for equities. Seasonality matters — funds love window-dressing into year-end.
* **Fed rate cuts and the end of QT in December** mean more liquidity sloshing into risk assets. Cash gets bored; bored cash buys small caps.
* **70% of institutional investors are underperforming** this year. They’re desperate to make up ground before Q4 closes.
* That means we’re looking at a **year-end chase** — rotations out of mega-caps and into “what hasn’t run yet.” Small-cap tech fits that bill perfectly if liquidity condition improves.

Combine that macro tailwind with POET’s catalysts, and we’ve got a setup where funds have to chase growth stories like this into the new year.

# The Setup

Right now you’ve got:

* Fundamental catalysts (orders, capital, partnerships).
* A technical setup sitting on support.
* Option flow that looks like someone knows something.
* A small float that can actually move when retail catches on.
* Macro market tailwinds.

Target for end of 2025 is **$10–$12**, which puts it around a $1B market cap conservatively. If the photonics hype actually lands and POET keeps landing contracts, $30 by mid-2026 isn’t insane.

This is what asymmetric risk looks like. Worst case you lose your call premium and post memes about it. Best case, you’re the guy who bought the photon dealer before Wall Street figured it out.

# Closing Thoughts

The AI boom doesn’t work without faster data pipes. POET builds the pipes. Institutions are buying. The retail crowd hasn’t caught on. We’re in the dumb zone where the risk looks huge and the reward looks ridiculous — which is exactly where the biggest money gets made. Play it however you want. Just don’t pretend you weren’t warned when this thing lights up like a data-center laser array.

Strategies? Buy Jan 16 2026 $10 call and chill with Jan 15 2027 $10.

If you're hesitant, please wait this turns into a multi-bagger and be like ""OH, I SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT. IT'S ON MY WATCHLIST FOREVER"".   
  
**Position**

284,NVDA,Will the next correction will be due to contracting AI spending?,"I'm not talking about AI spending going away, but rather the ability of companies to continue to grow their spending on AI each year. 

If you look at a company like Google, their trailing free cash flow seems strong at 66.7B. but that figure doesn't take into account the money spent on share repurchases, 59.5B, and dividend payments, 9.8B. When you factor these items into FCF it becomes negative. 

I see a lot of analysts talking about free cash flow in the AI age, but they never mention this. They claim that because FcF is so strong these companies will grow spending on AI. But At the end of the day, a company like Google isn't going to cut its dividends or its share repurchases, but I do think they will reduce AI spending growth. I don't mean they will cut AI spending, but rather the rate at which everyone expects them to continue to spend YoY will be lower when they need to choose between spending on AI and buying shares and paying dividends.

I think this could be a really important catalyst that causes people to freak out. Note, I am not saying AI companies are going to zero. I am not saying AI spending will go down. What I am saying is that this AI trade is based largely on an INCREASE of AI spending YoY. If the spending YoY stays the same then we don't get that increase. And if we don't get that increase then the multiples must adjust down. Even companies that are profitable like NVDA and PLTR (I own pltr shares and have for years) run the risk of getting halved. 

And if you think I'm crazy, Berkshire got halved 3 times over the decades and that company is managed by boomers who hate risk. 

Anyway, i would be paying attention to all large company filings from now on to see if their AI spending is meeting projections or tapering. 

Edit:
Someone mentioned BRK not having 50% drops. I remember watching a video where Buffett said BRK was cut in half at least three times, but I can't find the clip. If you look on the chart, BRK had two 50%+ drops. 1998-2000, 51% drop. 2007-2009, 53% drop. And a few other 30%+ drops mixed in. My point is that even the really safe companies can get hammered, so AI stocks (which are being propped up on spending that hasn't happened yet) are particularly at risk.",101,118,1760885209.0,2025-10-19T14:46:49+00:00,t3_1oarh39

Account was dormant for years. Come liberation day and that massive drop in April I bet the 800 or so left in my account on LEAPS assuming there’s no way this admin is going to let the market go to shit hyping up the “golden age”, plus devaluation of the dollar forcing money to continually go to equities. I chose GOOGL and NVDA mainly at first, NVDA was way less far out (expiry in July) because the premium was still expensive for my little account, the GOOGL contracts were Jun 2026 expiry. NVDA rebounded pretty quick and I used the proceeds from that to divest into a bunch of other random stuff (see screenshots) that I saw getting hyped in random threads, basically gambling and got lucky it worked out. GOOGL I held for a while but at one point it was such a massive gain that I sold and replaced with a smaller footprint, that is still the largest gain I’ve had to date from any trade ($555 to $4700). Lots of SPY trades for not a lot of gain mostly because I was hedging volatile times along the way with weekly calls/puts (especially over weekends and FOMC meetings where things felt dicey).

I’ve since converted more than half of my portfolio to shares but still have some random LEAPS where I found DD interesting and the risk/reward was appetizing, mainly for LAES as of late.

289,NVDA,AHOY! We set sail on the Digital Ocean - DOCN $20k YOLO,"Ahoy Mateys,

Last week I introduced you guys to the [P A T H](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o18pxg/30k_yolo_on_uipath_the_path_to_generational_wealth/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button), which was up 30% until the Trump Tariff Tape Bomb on Friday. I'm still holding a large January position there (see updates in post). Thesis intact!

But now, it be time to set sail on the DIGITAL OCEAN $DOCN as well!

I noticed a lot of you discussing “FuNdAmEnTaLs” and “PrIcE tO EaRnInGs RaTiOs.” Maybe some of you need to switch over to r/investing or r/dividends. Since when is this place full of a bunch of value investors? Anyways, here’s an AI play with fundamentals so strong that your mom, dad, grandma and grandpa can buy. Maybe they’ll love you if you can make them some money. I present: DOCN. 

Below, check out the chart. Notice anything? Almost the exact same set up as P A T H, which took off explosively last week after breaking mult-year accumulation range. Here we have a smaller market cap, and much lower P/E at 31.

End of September it JUST completed a Golden Cross.

https://preview.redd.it/4spb82g0n9vf1.png?width=1822&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51e8f47a51d85453a5a6da8deed7e2eafc04dd53

Trendline going back to August 2023 indicates a breakout here would be huge, and at a meager market cap of 3.6B, this can easily double from here through the end of the year. Once eyes are on this and it finally gets the attention it deserves, it’s going to absolutely fly in this frothy market that is salivating for any AI play it can sink its teeth into.

Now lets look at fUnDamENtalS

**What the fuck does DOCN do?** Digital Ocean is a cloud computing company that owns and operates the equipment to run data centers globally. That's right, THEY RUN DATA CENTERS. Oh, just the little old things that are required by **every single AI developer and crypto miner** to do… fucking everything. THINK MARK, THINK. 

**They’re selling SHOVELS IN A GOLD RUSH**

Now, as if just being a data center isn’t enough to send a stock flying in this market… \**cough cough\**… APLD, GLXY, CRWV, NBIS, INOD… \**cough cough*\* DOCN has something that few emerging AI/data/cloud companies bring to the table…**EARNINGS. This company actually makes money. They have a 31 p/e and reported an adjusted EPS of $.92 on September 4, 2025.** 

**DOCN IS ALSO A DIRECT VENDOR OF AMD CLOUD COMPUTING GPUS.** 

**The numbers:** Go ahead, take a look. Find me another data/AI company with a $3b market cap boasting numbers like this:

https://preview.redd.it/jlywjt63n9vf1.png?width=898&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bed35a8ce47fd7ee30ddb33f5c79e97f87ed2a45

These guys are printing money for their size. **They BIGLY beat earnings expectations eight times in a row. Last earnings they pumped 30%.** For comparison, APLD has a market cap 3x larger with only \~60m in quarterly revenue. (thats like one third of the quarterly revenue DOCN makes.) Jensen Huangs speech last week emphasized the importance of data centers. And that’s not where the NVDA connection stops…

**New Partnerships:** ever heard of NVDA? Ever heard of AMD? Ever heard of openAI? Well… DOCN has deals with **ALL THREE**. The openAI deal is brand new as of October 2025. AS IF this company isn’t a powerhouse on its own… they stand to be a DIRECT BENEFICIARY to the AMD/openAI deal… You know, the one that caused AMD to pump almost 50% last week???

 Why? I’ll repeat it again you dense motherfucker. **DOCN IS A DIRECT VENDOR FOR AMD GPUS.** **NAMELY, THE MI300X CHIP.** openAI is driving the implementation of AMD’s chips to supplement the heavy chip demand. 

As i was preparing this, an additional AMD deal was announced with Oracle for deployment of 50,000 AMD cloud GPUs… data/cloud/ai is the place to be in this market. 

***Now of course this is WSB and who cares about fundamentals when the market runs on crushing those “not long” and exploiting gamma ramps, and this is where things start to get really spicy…***

**IV / TA** 

Let me be clear. This is a 31x p/e company with excellent cash flow. The thesis of this play is NOT a S I play, but a realization of value… That said, bears have painted themselves into a corner. DOCN went public in 2021 and pumped to an ATH of $133 within months… then, stock suffered a large drawdown in the 2021/2022 bear market but stabilized around 30 to 40, where it’s been sideways for three years despite growing their revenue and EPS. 

Per fintel, the stock has 15.57% S I… That’s not all… check out the insane gamma ramp for the November option expiration. 

https://preview.redd.it/aa979si9n9vf1.png?width=941&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=35413ba0b91d84cc4994fb261e6c85214cef0e75

This can gamma ramp in a hurry with a breakout over $40-45, and IV is still very very low, sitting around 80% across most contracts. 

And because there’s no weekly options, market makers cannot easily hedge upwards momentum, so there’s absolutely nothing to stand in the way of this gamma ramp a month out if things pick up speed. Monthly options carry much greater gamma risk for market makers. You want in on this before it gets stacked with weeklies!

**Analysts upgrades:** turns out, I'm not the only idiot who has found this company… 

* Canaccord raised their price target from 49 to 55 10/10/2025
* UBS raised price target to 40 from 32
* Market Edge rates it as “Long” (their maximum rating)
* LSEG rates this stock as “out-perform” 

**Position:** Currently holding these calls post dating earnings.

TLDR; ***DOCN is*** ***SELLING SHOVELS IN A GOLD RUSH***, they’re a cloud/data center company that makes a lot of fucking money. They have a 30x p/e, a $3.6b market cap, established partnerships with AMD, NVDA, and a brand new October 2025 deal with OPENAI. They also stand to be a direct beneficiary of the AMD/openAI, and AMD/ORCL deal. Other data centers such as APLD, GLXY, CRWV, NBIS, INOD have pumped to the moon, while DOCN has been sleeping despite the fact that it has incredibly strong numbers. The stock is breaking out of a 3 year consolidation. Previous ATH was 133.

290,NVDA,"AI may be a bubble, but the sentiment in China is different - Why I am bullish on Chinese AI ($KWEB Overview)","***This is my personal research and opinion, not professional financial advice. I am not a licensed financial advisor. Please conduct your own research and consult qualified professionals before making investment decisions. Note: I hold options for $KWEB, and am likely to hold the underlying soon.*** 

As you know, the stock market trends heavily based on vibes. Sure, a companies fundies plays a part, but at the end of the day sentiment rules the market. 

In the United States, people are very fearful about AI. The investors, they say that its a [giant circlejerk of tech companies promising themselves different things, a bicycle wheel with $NVDA at the center. ](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5552965-ai-bubble-concerns-grow/) Despite this, AI stocks seem to be doing pretty damn well. 

Recently, Tencent Research Institute surveyed over 3,500 Chinese adults (the vast majority of which held a college degree or higher). Note that only [10% of the Chinese labor force](https://chinai.substack.com/p/chinai-331-chinese-public-perceptions) holds a bachelors, so this is a particularly educated set of individuals. 

To me, the most interesting bullet from the survey results is the following: 

&gt;The public's emotions regarding the role of AI in society are mixed, with both excitement and concern. While half of the public (50.2%) are ""very excited"" about the widespread application of AI, nearly as many respondents (46.3%) express both excitement and concern. A relatively small number (3.5%) only feel concerns.

96% of respondents, who are educated people, fit into the general excited category. There's NO way we're seeing that type of sentiment here in the USA. Here's what [Pew has found in surveys](https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2025/09/17/how-americans-view-ai-and-its-impact-on-people-and-society/): 

* 50% say they’re more concerned than excited about the increased use of AI in daily life, up from 37% in 2021.
* 10% are more excited than concerned.
* 38% say they’re equally excited and concerned.

That's a big difference. 

So what does that have to do with the market. 

I present to you $KWEB, KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF. 

In their words: 

&gt;KWEB is a China ETF that tracks the [CSI Overseas China Internet Index](https://www.investing.com/indices/csi-overseas-china-internet), which consists of China based companies whose primary business or businesses are focused on internet and internet-related technology. The Index is free float market capitalization weighted and includes publicly traded securities on either the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, NASDAQ Stock Market, or New York Stock Exchange.

KWEB's top holdings are positioned to benefit from China's optimism regarding AI: 

1. **Alibaba Group** \- Major AI cloud provider, with AI-related revenues achieving triple-digit growth​
2. **Tencent Holdings**  \- Third-largest AI public cloud services provider in China​
3. **PDD Holdings**  \- E-commerce platform leveraging AI for recommendations
4. **JD Dot Com** \- Advanced logistics and AI-driven operations​
5. **Baidu** \- China's leading search engine with significant AI investments

What about regulation? Regulators are approaching AI companies with more[ amicable intentions. ](https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/04/10/1091044/china-tech-regulation-angela-zhang/)There's a fear that approaching these companies with harsh intentions will result in significant economic pushback.

So what are the risks here? 

1. The ETF is volatile. It's not completely shielded from our own economics happenings. 
2. Trade tensions between the US and China has affected the strength of the ETF's holdings
3. Any currency fluctuations that may occur can have an affect on performance. 

Overall, the optimism behind AI in China, the soft approach to regulation, and [stimulus factors](https://www.home.saxo/content/articles/macro/chinas-bold-stimulus-measures-what-it-means-for-markets-25092024) make me feel pretty good about this industry.

291,NVDA,Finally green on a year!,"Been an options degenerate since 2019 thanks to this subreddit. Have blown multiple accounts, even lost  a hard earned 40k in a couple days in 2024, made most of it back, then lost it again on regarded options trading that next week. I had tried switching to shares multiple times the last couple years but as soon as i make a little side play on options that nets me enough to get my confidence back it would snowball into blowing half my account in a day, then hating myself for not having discipline. I started out this year strong holding my ASTS shares but my fear and greed chopped up my account into dust (options again ofc), having to restart from 0 early in the year. I told myself i would buy ABAT (around 10k shares at $1.5) due to it trading for dirt cheap and having some positive news catalysts coming out for their lithium recycling business, combined with a trump administration that would probably prioritize american companies especially rare earths. At many points i would relapse into options, catching myself selling some abat here and there to gamble with a thousand or two, watching my losses pile up again. I even broke the PDT rule on purpose to stop myself from being able to trade, while still holding my then 6350 abat shares. Couple months later and here we are, abat touched 10 dollars today and while i did sell too much at 3,4,5,6 etc, i can't complain about how much i've netted on this stock (about 22k so far). I have diversified much of my abat gains into other hot sectors but i do recognize that this rally will not last forever, and am always willing to take profit and reposition. I still do some option plays on the side but i make it a point to not put on a position that would bother me at all, maybe a couple % of my account max. I still have some ways to go before finally being in the green overall, but for me this milestone is huge and made me realize how quickly capital can build up when you're not actively trying to destroy it.

302,NVDA,Betting on big boats to get a big boat,"Hello there nerds, ladies, and gentlemen, 

I want to get yacht money, so I am buying up a boat business (CCL). They've already got big boy boats. Cutting out the middlemen sales people seems like it'll save some money in the long run.

Given I need a boat that I can take the whole family on, I had to do what any reasonable person would do and put some money towards a [177,800 ton](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/star-princess-sets-sail-on-maiden-voyage-from-barcelona-302575263.html) cabin cruiser. 

The boring stuff:  
Repeated quarterly earnings records  
Debt is being reduced and consolidated to lower borrowing costs  
New boats (i.e. large capital expenditures) now taking paying customers  
2026 already half booked and at higher prices than 2025  
Stable EPS increases and adjusted net income trending upward at double digit rates

Q&amp;A:  
Q: Why CCL stock?  
A: Only boats that have enough tonnage to support my mother. 

Q: Are you dumb?  
A: I can't read the question, can you ask it out loud? 

Q: Have you considered the fact it's hard to trade while at sea?  
A: Do you see how much [internet ](https://www.carnival.com/internet-plans)costs on these boats? That's called filthy profit margins. Truly disgusting.

Q: What else is in your portfolio?  
A: already long on PLTR, NVDA, MSFT, GOOGL, and QCOM.

Thoughts? If this goes well I should be able to get a nice kayak to trade up from into a bigger boat.

323,NVDA,Nobody watching APLD,"Nobody on here is really talking about Applied Digital (APLD) and I think it has serious potential. The stock is sitting around 19.50 right now and it has already run over 70 percent in the last three months. What makes it interesting is not just the chart but the actual business story.

APLD is building out high performance data centers specifically designed for AI workloads. They already signed hosting contracts worth over 11 billion dollars, mostly with CoreWeave, which is one of the fastest growing names in the AI compute space. These are not small speculative deals either. They are long term leases that give APLD revenue visibility for years.

The company has about 200 megawatts of capacity now and plans to reach 400 to 500 megawatts by 2026. Each 100 megawatts can generate around 300 to 400 million in annual revenue. Analysts are projecting revenue to grow from about 450 million in fiscal 2024 to over 1.2 billion by fiscal 2026. That type of growth would support a market cap in the 3 to 4 billion range compared to about 2 billion today.

If AI demand stays hot and they continue hitting build out milestones, I think a reasonable short term price target is 25 to 27 by the end of this year. If momentum really catches on and retail wakes up to this play, I could see it testing 30. The risk is execution and concentration with a few clients, but the math lines up.

Right now everyone is watching NVDA and the mega caps but APLD is a pure play AI infrastructure stock that is still under the radar. I am betting it is going to get a lot more attention soon.

MNDY is a software as a service platform, you can go google the ins and outs of what they do because that isn't the focus here. The point is this stock took an absolute prison beating after its Q2 earnings because of slightly lower than expected Q3 guidance. Despite the fact they raised full year guidance and had +27% year over year revenue growth, the stock still took a 30% haricut.

I don't believe in technical analysis or colorful lines but since the drop, the stock has been bouncing off resistance at $180 until it broke through on Thursday. On Friday it continued up while the rest of the market and tech sector sold off. Nothing about the core business has changed and I believe the selloff was bigly overdone, so over the course of the next month or two we'll see a move back to the $270 range. Two upcoming catalysts will likely help with that, MNDY speaks at the Goldman Sachs conference Sep 10th, and they're hosting the 2025 Elevate conference in NYC on Sep 17th-18th. Goldman Sachs maintains a BUY rating and $270 PT on the stock, and I expect we'll get more information about the AI hyped digital workers and product powerups the company has been teasing during Elevate.

Also Congressman Bresnahan, the guy who said he'd ban trading in congress, bought MNDY twice this year alongside his other tech purchases NVDA and SNOW.

334,NVDA,September,"Will we see the September Effect this year.  Historically it’s a bad month especially after a run up after summer.  I think it’ll be a volatile month for the following reasons:

Profit taking after traders return from vacation and starting with low volume trading leading to rebalancing portfolios.  

AI although high growth potential - it may be over extended and top heavy leaning towards a pull back.  Growth in this area has been concentrated towards big tech, and potentially over capacity with China jumping in.  NVDA has held up well, but sales aboard could slow due to international growth in this area.  

Clean up for fund portfolios selling off the losers to rebalance and realized tax lost.  

Lastly the everybody is aware of the effect and could lead to selling hoping to get back in mid November.

I loaded up on UVIX calls.  They are a bargain currently.  I think we’ll see a lot of volatility this season.

GLD looked like it was finally going to close for a possible b/o Friday and with the drawdown in crypto smelled right.

357,NVDA,"$600,000 $AMD call option trade + $1.2m hedge","TLDR: AMD finally caught up to NVDA, the market doesn’t realize, go giga long $AMD. 

Buy $TLT just incase market crashes so you don’t blow your account up in a black swan, or if thesis is wrong. 


Trade Setup:
	•	33% Portfolio: AMD calls 12/17/27, $360 strike (111% out of the money as of today)
	•	66% Portfolio: $TLT shares (U.S. Treasury bonds)

$AMD Thesis In A Nutshell:

$NVDA market cap: $4.4T
$AMD market cap: $270B

The world is in a massive race to get more chips, and NVDA looks on track for a $10T market cap.

For the first time starting this quarter, AMD’s MI355X is on par with NVDA, with cheaper chips. Sam Altman promoted the MI400 and MI450 at an AI event earlier this year. Hyperscaler consensus is that they are testing the MI350 this year to get familiar with integrating AMD into their data centers, so they will be ready to place big orders next year for the rack scale MI400 and MI450. This was noted on the most recent earnings call.

From here on, AMD’s chips will be on par, if not better, than NVDA for inference, which both Jensen Huang and Sam Altman agree will grow 1000x+ from current demand levels. Jensen said this on the GP2 podcast interview.

In 2024, AMD did $12B in data center revenue with inferior chips, while NVDA did $115B. If AMD can do $55B in 2027, which is half of NVDA’s 2024 data center revenue, it is easily a $1T company, or an $800 stock.

Everything suggests AMD will have a competitive product at a competitive price point, with demand setting up to be off the charts in 2026 and 2027, similar to NVDA’s neck breaking 2023 and 2024 growth rates of 100%+.

Second Leg Of Trade:

If there is a recession or a black swan event, the Fed will cut rates and send TLT soaring, making up for a $0 AMD option. This is a simple hedge against a Covid style scenario.

Best Case:
	•	TLT gains 50% to 100% from rate cuts on 66% of my portfolio
	•	AMD 4x in 2.5 years from AI chip demand, with calls returning 20x on 33% of my portfolio

Base Case:
	•	AMD calls go to $0 if NVDA outcompetes AMD like in past AI failures such as MI300
	•	TLT rises as rates come down, which recovers the call premiums and results in break even in about 2.5 years

Worst Case:
	•	AMD calls go to $0
	•	TLT drops because inflation spikes, resulting in a 30% loss there as well. This is unlikely in my opinion but possible.

MI350X and MI355X should already drive healthy growth for AMD. However, MI400 will be the real game changer because of its scalability. AMD already raised the price for MI350, which just went into production, to $25,000 per chip. MI400 will be a true rack scale solution, making it highly competitive for large cluster projects.

# Leaning into AI Criticism: 

On every post I make that is longer than 5 complete sentences, someone accuses the post of being written by AI. I only take offense to that notion because my analysis and writing is far more valuable than what any AI could produce. I am putting this to the test by asking the new and exciting GPT5 model for its own estimates which will be included in my comparisons to analysts.  


# Updates to My Estimates:

Overall, there are only minimal changes to the [initial post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1m5yp45/muted_results_but_booming_guidance_nvda_q2/) a few weeks ago. In the interest of Reddit attention spans, I will only highlight the changes and new totals.  
  
**Total Revenue: $46.4B**, Up $0.25 (Gaming Increase)  
**EPS: $1.03**, Up $0.01 (Increased Revenue)  


# A New Challenger in GPT5:

[Headline Estimates from GPT5](https://preview.redd.it/y7h3eiw0cuhf1.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9332c28885bdbec364be95f7efe16ecefe3d122)

I fed my previous posts to GPT5 (they're on Reddit anyway) and prompted it to come up with its own estimates. The above image shows the headline projections from GPT and its bullish estimates prompted me to ask for a segment breakdown. 

[Revenue by Segment and EPS](https://preview.redd.it/5ut7zj4ccuhf1.png?width=1562&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66f3898cf08e8c71f25064cd9611a61cb05ef3c3)

GPT5 is expecting strong numbers from NVDA's Data Center Segment, while its Gaming and Prof. Visualization estimates are lower than mine. GPT5 is slightly more bullish Robo &amp; Auto than I am.   


# The Estimates Stacked Up:

[GPT5 noted this as a fair way to represent their estimates](https://preview.redd.it/9u6xxt9wcuhf1.png?width=1756&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6270483896b29093ca5d80ac7db2f1f61adb0c3)

This is what the three estimates look like stacked against each other, and it now offers a wide range of perspectives. Analyst consensus is almost always conservative (going on 3 consecutive years of beats), so comparing my detailed analysis to a likely-sandbagged estimate is hardly fair. Since AI is supposed to take my job as an analyst, let's see how the actuals compare.  


# Positions:

Still in my 200 shares and ATM (Bit ITM now) Covered Calls, looking to manage in September or October.   


[$175 Calls at around 0.60 Delta Early August](https://preview.redd.it/4ioivgxjeuhf1.jpg?width=1179&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f834007b66898571302f5691d4b081a1c1ea39d)

382,NVDA,Muted Results but Booming Guidance: NVDA Q2 Earnings Analysis,"**TL;DR at the bottom--I broke my wrist touching grass last weekend so this** ***is*** **the short version**

This is my third consecutive quarter posting an independent analysis of NVDA’s quarterly earnings. My Q4 FY25 and Q1 FY26 estimates are available on my profile, and a comparison to analyst consensus and actual results in those quarters can be seen below.

[Note 2025Q1 Refers to Non-GAAP H20 Excluded](https://preview.redd.it/mmfycac78bef1.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f6bdebbe39904b4b4e944ef04c1020325685bdf)

[While Analysts Consistently Underestimate Revenue, My Bullish Bias has Decreased Significantly](https://preview.redd.it/zvdf6kug8bef1.png?width=848&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf6b37820b364715f26fbff6c646388c7c67959d)

On last quarter's earnings call, the Company guided for a considerable slowdown in revenue growth. They noted that the forecast included a negative impact of $8 billion from losing access to China. Jensen was particularly open on the call, saying,

“On export control... the platform that wins China is positioned to lead globally. Today, however, the $50 billion China market is effectively closed to U.S. industry.”

Jensen has been consistently meeting with Trump and his administration to get back into China. As recently as July 14th, NVDA provided a positive update on this disruption in a blog post, telling investors they are going to regain the ability to do so soon. Unfortunately, this will likely not affect revenue in Q2, but could lead to optimism from The Company when issuing guidance for Q3 and beyond.

Like in Q1, I will analyze each of the four main revenue segments and create a combined estimate. Since the Data Center segment is both the largest and in the spotlight, I will start there. 

# Data Center Estimate:

When issuing guidance, Colette Kress (CFO) stated the following: “Total revenue is expected to be $45 billion, plus or minus 2%. We expect modest sequential growth across all of our platforms. In Data Center, we anticipate the continued ramp of Blackwell to be partially offset by a decline in China revenue.”  
  
The Blackwell ramp is expected to be completely recognized this quarter, yet the segment is set to only experience “modest growth” due to being locked out of China. The H20 sales halt hit with about three weeks left in Q1, and revenue grew 9.83% QoQ. NVDA still does not have the license required to sell in China, with less than two weeks left in Q2. A re-acceleration of growth seems unlikely this quarter, and my initial estimate is closer to 5-7% growth (\~$41 to $42 billion). 

[The Graph Shows Revenue from Data Centers Since 2024Q1 and Highlights the Deceleration in 2025Q1.](https://preview.redd.it/7n0g32oz8bef1.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d31bb77ea496875aa86919a961199b793d099415)

The negative impact from the disruption in China will be the largest in Q2, which suggests a continued slowdown in QoQ growth. $41.5 billion would represent just over 6% growth, and with the current data and outlook, it will serve as the preliminary estimate.

# Gaming Estimate:

The rebound in gaming revenue in Q1 outpaced even the most bullish estimates. The record $3.8 billion in Q1 revenue represented a \~50% QoQ increase and was over 15% higher than the previous record. The report cites strength from the partnership with Nintendo (Switch 2) and the CFO noted, “Strong adoption by gamers, creatives, and AI enthusiasts.” The gaming beat helped NVDA’s headline revenue total in Q1, and The Company is optimistic strength will continue. However, given the cyclical nature of gaming and Q1 being such a positive surprise, it is difficult to project further QoQ growth to another record. $3.5 billion in Q2 would achieve 20% YoY growth in this segment and will serve as the preliminary estimate.

# Prof. Visualization / Robotics &amp; Auto Estimate:

In the interest of time, and given that these two segments combined for barely over $1 billion in Q1, these two segments are being bundled into one breakdown. Prof. Visualization was mentioned by the CFO on the conference call and is expected to return to QoQ growth after being flat in Q1. Robotics &amp; Auto was down sequentially in Q1 but still up over 70% YoY. There was no mention of expectations in Q2. I currently have \~$1.15 billion for the two segments combined, and will look to fine-tune this closer to the release date.

# Total Revenue Estimate: $46.15 Billion



# Earnings Estimate:

On the Q1 report, NVDA added a Non-GAAP EPS line that specifically excluded the H20 charge. It came in at $0.96 per share, surpassing the consensus of $0.93 but falling $0.01 short of my $0.97 estimate. 

There was some initial confusion surrounding the three metrics as “regular” Non-GAAP EPS came in at $0.81, much higher than the Factset analyst consensus of $0.73. 

In Q2, NVDA will likely return to reporting the standard two EPS metrics, and yahoo finance lists the average estimate from 40 analysts at $1.00 per share. The earnings whisper number is a bit lower at $0.94, while the highest estimate from a single analyst is $1.09. 

While it is relatively easy to find consensus estimates for headline figures like EPS and Total Revenue, most analysts do not break out revenue by segment nor show how they convert top-line revenue to bottom-line profitability. This analysis shows the full process of forecasting revenue by segment and how it translates to the bottom-line in a form of unique transparency. 

The last section established the revenue estimate, but to get to EPS, estimates need to be made for gross margin, operating expenses, non-operating expenses, and total shares outstanding. 

NVDA’s company-issued guidance for both gross margin and operating expenses has been largely reliable in recent quarters. In Q2, the company expects gross margin of 72% and operating costs of $4 billion, which are used in this estimate. 

The company does not issue guidance for non-operating expenses nor shares outstanding, but accurate estimates can be obtained. 

[Stabilization of Cost Increases in 2024 with uptick in 2025Q1](https://preview.redd.it/ulf2s2nz9bef1.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38ed7a3d33b88cfaf4134645ffd638b043f67ca7)

The above graph shows historical data for non-operating expenses and QoQ growth for the segment. The growth rate has largely stabilized compared to previous years, even with an uptick in Q1. $4.0 billion would represent a decrease back to about 5% growth, while my current estimate of $4.1 billion represents an increase of just under 8%. 

Estimating shares outstanding can be tricky, as the company’s share repurchase program is inconsistent. NVDA still has about $25 billion authorized under the current plan for share repurchases, but that is down after aggressive buybacks in Q1. 

This analysis estimates about $9 billion in buybacks in Q2, reducing the shares outstanding from 24.61 to 24.55 billion (60m shares @ 150 = $9 B). The estimate is similar to the amount repurchased in Q4 and is lower than repurchases in Q1.   


[EPS Calculation Visualized, While Highlighting Opaqueness of Consensus](https://preview.redd.it/kglfaixaabef1.png?width=1924&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d95f34e8f6bf00b14d87a7d6d645d9e400bb658)

The calculation comes out to $1.02 EPS, which is slightly above the average analyst’s expectations. $46.15 billion in revenue is also only slightly above the consensus. 

This is the closest my estimates have been to the consensus, which has been surpassed each of the last 10 quarters. Given that I expect relatively muted results this quarter, guidance for the rest of the year will be in focus during the call. 

# Guidance:

After the positive update on China sales, investors are looking for strong guidance. While it’s not as straightforward as adding the lost $8 billion back into the forecast, analysts are expecting the worst to be in the past. Investors are looking for signs that the “start of the new wave” Jensen mentioned last quarter will materialize this year. 

The current expectation for Q3 revenue is \~$51.5 billion, an increase of 13% from Q2 expectations ($45.55). In Q1, revenue grew 10% QoQ to $44.06 billion. This means analysts expect just over 3% growth in the current quarter with notable re-acceleration in Q3. 

Analysts are looking for at least a piece of the Chinese market in Q3 with the $51.5 billion forecast. Q2 guidance would have been closer to $53 billion with full access to China, suggesting the Q3 forecast still projects some disruption in China near term. 

If NVDA signals a faster-than-expected ramp in sales to China, guidance expectations that already look strong could still be too low. However, any delays in the licensing process or misaligned inventory could dampen Q3’s forecast. 

# Valuation:

Regardless of belief in the company, NVDA is expensive right now. “Expensive” in this case means that it is trading at higher multiples than multi-year averages. 

Even using the H20 excluded EPS number from Q1, NVDA has earned $3.34 per share over the last four quarters. Trailing earnings are expected to increase to $3.66 after Q2’s report, while full year EPS is currently expected to come in at around $4.30. 

Based on a current price of \~$173, NVDA is currently trading at over 51x TTM earnings, and 40x forward earnings.

While NVDA has previously traded for 40x forward earnings, it has also traded for closer to 20x forward earnings as recently as this year. 

NVDA is also currently experiencing an elevated Price to Sales ratio (higher than 75% of history) of over 28x sales, and its Price to Book ratio of 50x is more expensive than 91% of NVDA’s history. 

Buying NVDA at $170 makes sense only if the company continues to deliver bullish surprises on top of already sky-high expectations. I am not selling shares ahead of the report, even with the price outpacing my targets. 

# Positions:

When I began posting NVDA analysis and creating my price targets, NVDA traded for about $140 per share. At the time, I felt the price was fair, and it wasn’t until the liberation day tariff sell-off to sub $90 that I began buying more aggressively. 

I currently own 200 shares with a cost basis around $125. While I expected NVDA to recover rather quickly, the near 100% rally from April lows leads me to believe hype and FOMO are driving the price higher rather than fundamental growth. While NVDA’s growth has been explosive, the current price leaves no room for negative catalysts. 

Based on my expectations for NVDA in the rest of 2025, I sold an ATM covered call expiring in December. I am willing to sell at $175 between now and the end of the year, so I decided to collect $3000 ($1500 x2) selling that call option. I now have $15 of downside protection through December or will sell my shares for a massive profit.

385,NVDA,I Sold My Corvette for $78K and Went All-In on RMBS.,"Ticker: $RMBS
Position: Scaling into 1,000+ shares 
Conviction: Stronger than the LT4 torque curve
Catalyst: IP dominance in AI memory infrastructure nobody’s pricing in

🏎️ The Setup:

I sold my 2019 Sebring Orange Z06 — 2LZ, Kalahari interior, 5,955 miles of pure sauce — for $78K cash.

Why?

Because while everyone’s chasing gains in NVDA, AMD, and MU, I went full galaxy brain and bought the company that quietly gets paid every time those companies scale.

I didn’t just trade torque for tech.
I traded a car for compoundable alpha.



🧠 What is Rambus (RMBS)?
	•	NOT a RAM company, it’s the patent-powered IP tollbooth for AI memory.
	•	Their tech fuels DDR5, HBM3, PCIe, and CXL — aka every AI/data center ramp in progress.
	•	Licensing model = 80% gross margins, no debt, $500M cash, printing risk-free cash every quarter.
	•	No manufacturing risk, just collecting checks like a chip landlord.



🔥 Technical Breakout Confirmed
	•	Cleared a cup-with-handle base at $63.15, broke out hard and is now pushing toward ATHs near $69–70.
	•	Riding above 21- and 50-day moving averages like it’s on magnetic rails.
	•	Relative Strength: 87
	•	IBD Composite Rating: 96
	•	EPS Rating: 99

📉 Every technical signal says:
This thing wants to fly.

💼 Who’s Buying?

Institutions are already ahead of you:

Fund	Value Held	     Trend
BlackRock	$1.18B	      ↑ Increasing
Vanguard	$644M	↑ Increasing
T. Rowe Price	$453M	↑ Increasing
Invesco	$234M	       ↑ Increasing
Janus, Mariner, Signaturefd	+$113M in July	Just entered

Even IBD just lumped RMBS in with NVDA and AVGO on their elite “funds are loading” list. This ain’t some rando tech penny — this is the next chapter of AI infrastructure.



📆 What’s Next?
	1.	Q2 Earnings – July 28
	•	Expected: $0.58 EPS / $167M revenue
	•	Rambus always sandbags. Beat + raise incoming.
	2.	AI build-out tailwind
	•	DDR5, HBM3, CXL adoption means licensing revenue spikes.
	•	They’re in every next-gen memory and PCIe lane that matters.
	3.	Price Targets
	•	Analyst Median: $71
	•	Top End: $90+
	•	My PT: 3-digit club.
Because IP + AI = asymmetry.



🚀 Why I’m All-In:
	•	Most traders buy what CNBC tells them. I buy what CNBC will eventually discover.
	•	NVDA gets headlines. RMBS gets checks.
	•	I’m not swinging for a 10% gain. I’m leveraging intellectual property in a vertical that can’t function without it.

You can keep your car. I’ll take the cash flow.
The Corvette was fast… but RMBS moves in compound interest. 💵📈

398,NVDA,$1.4m --&gt; $5.4m in 18 Months - 85% in Cash Now,"I've lost a lot of sleep over the past 18 months trading my mom's IRA (she's more than ok with this!), and I've been able to substantially outperform the market.  I lost most of her portfolio 3 months ago in April (bottom tick was $800k) but have been able to grow it back to a much higher value than it was before the tariff BS.

Total gains in 18 months: $4,000,000

I have been trading options (obviously, this is WSB.) For the first 6 months, my big winner was HIMS, although I sold WAY too early. I bought calls around $10 and sold around $20-$24. My other big plays have been scalping NVDA and especially GOOGL. Despite being a lousy hold for the last year, I've consistently YOLO'd into GOOGL on big pull backs, including the Apple congressional testimony news (Google searches were down for the first time on Safari, although Google denied this.)

My strategy is to buy near or at-the-money calls 2-5 months out with at least one earnings in between. I don't usually hold through earnings. I try to scale out of the position over the course of 2-10 trading days. I'm happy with 20%-50% gains and am fine with leaving money on the table. Because the calls are many months out, there isn't too much theta decay if the stock goes sideways.

I generally keep cash on the side to YOLO into calls if there's a huge overreaction on a given ticker. If I'm fully invested, it's hard to take advantage of certain opportunities. I don't think I have that much patience, but I've definitely improved since my early trading days.

On Friday I sold most of the portfolio and am now 85%  in cash. The other 15% is in QQQ puts and UNH calls.

**SKIP THIS PART IF RETARDED:**

Thanks to NVDA and Co, computer chips are faster than ever. The problem? Electronic data transmission can't keep up. Because of thermodynamics, the fastest that data can effectively be electronically transmitted at the chip level is around 100Gbps-ish. In order to maximize the power of those NVDA chips companies pay millions for, they'll HAVE TO switch to photonics (data transmission using light). Okay, so who is making this technology? A lot of companies (Broadcom, Mitsubishi, Foxconn, Lumentum, etc). The tricky part is converting between electronic data from the chips and photonic data from the transmission modules. This is where POET Technologies comes in (here is their website, if you want to try to better understand what they do: [POET](https://www.poet-technologies.com/))

POET is incredibly well-positioned for the inevitable photonics boom. Their partners include Foxconn, Mitsubishi, Celestial AI, Luxshare, Adtran, Mentech, and Lessengers. POET will supply these companies with Optical Interposers that they will add to their Optical Modules. Those companies will sell those Optical Modules to AI data centers, cloud computing, telecom, etc. Diagram for the mentally impaired:

https://preview.redd.it/nxasurdroxbf1.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54fa88c56f66e8992752794c69041ccfc47ad597

Now, POET is a pre-revenue company. However, the switch from electronic to photonic chip-level data transmission is happening *as we speak*. And so, the single most important statement of this entire DD: **POET WILL START SHIPPING ORDERS TO THEIR CUSTOMERS AND MAKING SIGNIFICANT REVENUE WITHIN THE NEXT MONTHS, WEEKS, OR DAYS.** The reason why this hasn't already started is because the customers in the final step of the diagram need to wait 6-9 months to test-run the technology before finalizing their orders -- standard practice in the industry ([Source](https://agoracom.com/ir/POETTechnologies/forums/discussion/topics/809555-OFC-Summary/messages/2434913?entity=thread&amp;view=thread)). In other words, the orders have ALREADY BEEN PLACED, and everyone is simply waiting for the tests to conclude to actually start fulfilling them: ""In fact, \[Rep. from POET customer\] stated that they already have a large hyperscaler customer who has placed orders for the solution."" [(](https://agoracom.com/ir/POETTechnologies/forums/discussion/topics/809555-OFC-Summary/messages/2434913?entity=thread&amp;view=thread)[Source](https://agoracom.com/ir/POETTechnologies/forums/discussion/topics/809555-OFC-Summary/messages/2434913?entity=thread&amp;view=thread)).

With such a small market cap, a skeptic might wonder how POET would be able to defend their valuable position in the industry. First, they have a shit ton of patents for their technology ([Source](https://patents.justia.com/assignee/poet-technologies-inc)). Additionally, their various partners/customers have incorporated POET's technology into a wide variety of transmission speeds: 400Gbps, 800Gbps, 1.6Tbps, and even 3.2Tbps. Right now, 1.6T and 3.2T are not needed in the vast majority of cases. However, as companies require faster and faster data transmission in the coming years, they'll still be buying optical modules with POET's tech inside. Because of this, I cannot reiterate enough how well-positioned POET is to capitalize on the AI / data center boom.

**IF RETARDED, START READING HERE:**

Knowing that POET will start making money hand-over-fist in the near future, the next step is to calculate how much they could actually make. Taken from their Q4 2024 earnings report:

""Established a major wafer-level assembly and test facility for optical engines in Penang, Malaysia with the signing of several agreements with Globetronics Manufacturing Sdn. Bhd., a leading semiconductor manufacturer and contractor, equipping Globetronics with the capacity to manufacture an initial **1 million POET optical engines annually**."" ([Source](https://www.poet-technologies.com/news/poet-technologies-reports-fourth-quarter-2024-financial-results))

But that's not all. They recently made another manufacturing agreement for even more production, expected to be ready in 1 to 2 quarters:

""POET Technologies has signed a manufacturing agreement with NationGate Solutions in Malaysia to produce optical engine assemblies, enhancing its manufacturing capabilities and **addressing growing customer demand**."" ([Source](https://www.tipranks.com/news/company-announcements/poet-technologies-expands-manufacturing-with-nationgate-in-malaysia))

Because the Globetronics facility is already up and running ([Source](https://x.com/POETtech/status/1938241918712090821)), I'll be conservative and use the production numbers from that facility alone. Again, being conservative, I'll average the 400G and 800G optical units at $250 a pop. 1M units \* $250 / unit is $250M. Multiply that by a P/S ratio of 10, and you get a market cap of $2.5B -- representing a **5X** from the current market cap of $500M. And that revenue is going to start pouring in any day. But let's get crazy and estimate what this could be 3 years in the future. 3M units \* $500 / unit (accounting for 1.6T, 3.2T being more expensive) \* 10 P/S ratio = $15B market cap -- **30X upside** from current share price.

The best part about this situation? Wall Street doesn't care enough about pre-revenue microcaps to understand POET's potential. Once institutions take the time to understand POET's position in a rapidly burgeoning industry, this thing will practically double overnight (And yes, I know that it's already up over 50% from the recent lows. I posted this as soon as this got above the $500M mkt cap requirement).

https://preview.redd.it/gfcstni4cybf1.png?width=724&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a4e5793fb2e02108aa0b06dc6a1f7434d0c9df55

If this stock gets ANY sort of public attention, the market will quickly re-price its valuation. Coupled with the incoming slew of positive news (fulfilled purchase orders, revenue, new products, etc), this has the potential to go on a crazy run. The only caveat is that I can't tell you when exactly this could happen. POET's CEO has reiterated that H2 2025 will bring revenue -- I'd guess orders start getting announced before September. That doesn't mean you should go and buy calls expiring in a month, though.

https://preview.redd.it/n8yvi1vq6ybf1.png?width=1505&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7336f25c19e73565ad46e676de4dd2981ecbbc3

The easiest way to play this is to buy shares and chill -- I am almost certain that POET will at least double by the end of the year. If you happen to be a degenerate gambler and are morally against buying shares -- go for 1/16/26 or 1/15/27 10c. The options chain is stupidly bullish, and it could easily gamma squ\*eze if the share price continues to go up and degenerates continue buying OTM calls.

https://preview.redd.it/1c0jwnvt7ybf1.png?width=713&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a1f8fa4fe4b1f09fdb7837a6ccd1d25b5f4338c

My base case is $12/share by EOY, and $30/share by Q3 2026. My optimistic case is $30/share by EOY, and $45-60/share (3.75B to 5B mkt cap) by Q3 2026. We could easily see $60 or higher sooner than that if you get hype and news at the right time.

**TL;DR** \-- POET, a $500M mkt cap photonics company, is on the cusp of generating significant revenue. Think of the potential for an immediate 5X return, minimum. The market is largely unaware of this stock, and it will undergo a dramatic re-pricing in the coming weeks and months. Buy into the next multi-bagger BEFORE it happens.

413,NVDA,$3700 to $20000,"I made a decent amount of money during tariff season when the markets were going down, it was easy money with puts but I missed out on the recovery (kept shorting and lost those gains) and lost more than the money I gained. 

I had to give a comeback and I chose SMCI. I bought the dip on Monday, bought the fear cause I know they wont make it easy for us. Technicals were looking good and NVDA was ready to make ATH with AMD already pumping. Swung these calls the whole week. I sold 30% today and swinging the rest 70%  ",486,50,1750969892.0,2025-06-26T20:31:32+00:00,t3_1llatos
