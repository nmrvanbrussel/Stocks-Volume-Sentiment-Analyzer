1,TSM,Intel and Potential Apple Chip Manufacturing Partnership,"Intel shares jumped as much as 10% on Friday, marking the stock's fifth consecutive session of gains, after analyst Ming-Chi Kuo reported that Apple is on track to have Intel manufacture its lowest-end M-series chips using the 18A process as early as mid-2027. The potential deal would involve production of approximately 15-20 million units annually for MacBook Air and iPad Pro devices, representing a cautious diversification of Apple's supply chain away from sole reliance on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.

The rally came despite ongoing legal tensions with TSMC, including reports of a raid on an Intel executive's home in Taiwan related to allegations of stolen technology. Investors appeared to look past the litigation drama, focusing instead on the prospects of securing Apple as a foundry customer, which analysts described as having improved significantly.

Intel led chip stocks higher on Friday, helping drive the broader S&amp;P 500 to gains and turning the index positive for November. The stock outperformed competitors on heavy trading volume, with options activity notably elevated. The potential Apple partnership, while modest in scale compared to TSMC's high-end chip production for Apple, would mark a significant validation of Intel's foundry ambitions and its advanced 18A manufacturing process.",53,19,1764380434.0,2025-11-29T01:40:34+00:00,t3_1p9ca98,investing

1,TSM,"Explain the Google, TSMC, Nvidia dynamic to me","**Update: I’d like to think some people at Wallstreet read this post and concluded it made no sense for TSM to go down with NVDA. If you bought the TSM dip when I wrote this post, you'd be up 4%. Enjoy the small profit on me.**

TSM tends to trade with Nvidia. Nvidia goes up, TSM goes up. Makes sense. AI trade.

Google goes up because Meta wants to buy access to their TPUs. Google needs to make more TPUs to sell to Meta right? So Google needs to make more TPUs at TSM. Google only makes TPUs at TSMC. Not Samsung. Not Intel.

**So why is Google up today, TSM down? Where does the market think Google makes their AI chips?** Are Wallstreet/traders this brainless that they don't even know TSM wins regardless of whether they're making Google TPUs or Nvidia GPUs? TSM doesn't give a damn who is buying their wafers. It makes no difference to TSM if Google or Apple or Nvidia or AMD or Broadcom buys the wafer.

PS. Meta wanting to buy some Google TPUs isn't entirely bad for Nvidia. After all, Meta is also building internal AI chips with Broadcom. Everyone is trying to not go all in on Nvidia because it's a risk to rely on a single supplier. Since Nvidia chips are literally sold out for one whole year, if Meta needs more compute now, they have no where to go to. The only options for Meta are Broadcom custom chips (already doing that), AMD chips (already doing that), or Google TPUs (finally doing it now). This is a bull signal for entire AI market because Meta doesn't have enough chips.",295,213,1764081713.0,2025-11-25T14:41:53+00:00,t3_1p6e5nl,stocks

27,TSM,Future Tech Pure Plays to Invest in Now?,"I’m curious what future tech folks are investing in / watching today with a multi-decade view. I’m especially interested in pure plays, and ideally in areas that haven’t already gone on a 300% or so tear over the past year.

GPUs (NVDA, TSM, AMD)

VTOL air taxis (ACHR, JOBY)

Quantum computing (RGTI, IONQ, QTUM, QBTS)

Nuclear / fusion-related plays (no true pure plays yet, but CVE, OKLO, GOOG, CCJ on the uranium side)

10,TSM,Talk me out of rolling my covered calls 2 years out,"So i have some covered calls on shares I don't want to lose. I know. I know. No lecturing please. Psychology aside. I have some upside on them even on the strike i have so it would be a big tax event. When looking at the rolling options the 2 year ones seem to offer the biggest annual return. I am aware that that assumes the stock will at least maintain its current level. Which is ok for me. 

Anyway i have:

1 amd cc 150 expiring next week

9 amd cc 130 expiring February

3 tsm cc 190 expiring next week

  
I have found these rolls which I can do at no debit and seem to give a great annual return, when compared to an assumed annual market return of 10%.

1 amd cc 220 January28 

46% return in total for 26 months of time. Annually this comes out at a nearly 20% rate of return. Assuming AI doesn't completely collapse and not recover in 2 years still I am confident amd is not going to go -10% in 2 years time.

  
9 amd cc 175 January28

29% return for 23 months here. So over 13.8% annually. 14% I would say here. Still better then the assumed 10% annual market return.

  
3 tsm cc 240 January28

26% return for 26 months. 12% annually, only just better than the market. Although tsm is the better company as compared to amd so the price is even less likely to be under 240 in 2 years then for amd. Also there is a dividend of more than 1% annually. So that brings the rate of return to 13% annually.

  
I don't know, I obviously prefer shorter rolls but I am struggling to find in the 6 month range that give even 10% annual return, much less 12+%. Also I am aware these shares are going to get called away at some point unless I do massive debit rolls. But in that case why let them be assigned now instead of in 2 years when i get 12% growth on the cash annually?

  
I know it is a stupid thing to do, I don't want to do it. Please give me some logical reasons why I shouldn't do it aside from amd/tsm share price might not be at this level in 2 years. (At that point the calls would expire worthless and it would have been as if I was holding the shares normally over those 2 years which would make me have a better return than normal shareholders over those 2 years). Frankly I would be pretty happy if that happened, as I am fine holding the shares permanently, especially tsm, and I would be doing that anyway if they weren't burdened with covered calls. So this scenario would happen to me anyway, with much bigger impact. If anything the covered calls are a hedge against that, so this is not a risk for me.",15,25,1763119414.0,2025-11-14T11:23:34+00:00,t3_1owtx3l,options

1,TSM,"TSMC’s October sales rose 16.9%, the slowest since Feb 2024, fueling debate over whether the AI chip boom is losing momentum","No paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tsmc-slowing-monthly-sales-fuel-072623633.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tsmc-slowing-monthly-sales-fuel-072623633.html)

&gt;Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported slowing growth in monthly revenue, highlighting uncertainty over the sustainability of the AI boom even as industry behemoths including Nvidia Corp. chase more chip supplies.

&gt;The company posted a 16.9% rise in sales for October, the slowest pace since February 2024. Analysts on average are expecting sales to increase 16% in the current quarter. TSMC’s American depository receipts were up as much as 3% in pre-market trading.

&gt;Industry executives remain buoyant about AI-driven growth as major tech firms are accelerating investments in data centers. The TSMC revenue gain also just covers just a single month of business, offering investors less insight.

&gt;Investors were jolted last week by a sudden slump in Asia’s technology shares, which served as a stark reminder that the world-beating rally in artificial intelligence and semiconductor stocks may be nearing a short-term crest. Wall Street chief executives have warned of an overdue market correction, with Michael Burry’s Scion Asset Management also disclosing bearish wagers on Nvidia.

&gt;That’s despite massive ample spending plans from leading AI players.

&gt;Meta Platforms Inc., Alphabet Inc., [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com) Inc. and Microsoft Corp. will collectively spend more than $400 billion to fund an AI buildout next year, a 21% hike from 2025, to secure leadership in the race in emerging technologies.

&gt;Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang of Nvidia, which is the primary AI chip supplier to major companies, said on Saturday his business is “growing month by month, stronger and stronger.”

&gt;Huang met TSMC Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei and asked for more chip supplies during his two-day whirlwind trip to Taiwan this time when major chip designers are all chasing limited supplies from the Hsinchu-based company.

&gt;TSMC is also the go-to chipmaker for the Santa Clara, California-based firm’s competitors including Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Qualcomm Inc., and it makes Apple Inc.’s silicon for iPhones and other gadgets.

&gt;Huang’s optimism is shared by his rivals. Qualcomm Chief Executive Officer Cristiano Amon told Bloomberg TV last week that the world is underestimating how big AI will get.

&gt;In October, Wei told analysts that TSMC’s capacity was still very tight and the company is working hard to narrow the gap between demand and supplies.

30,TSM,Is my portfolio too risky? Planning to hold long term.,"Hey everyone,
I’d love to get some thoughts on my portfolio and whether it’s too risky for someone planning to just buy and hold long term (10+ years).

Here’s my current taxable portfolio (~$4,600 total):

	•	VOO (Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF) – 36.3%
	•	SCHD (Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF) – 9.2%
	•	VTI (Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF) – 6.7%
	•	QQQM (Invesco NASDAQ 100 ETF) – 6.7%
	•	SMH (VanEck Semiconductor ETF) – 6.0%
	•	TSLA (Tesla) – 5.4%
	•	AAPL (Apple) – 4.8%
	•	GOOGL (Alphabet) – 4.5%
	•	NVDA (NVIDIA) – 4.4%
	•	ARKK (ARK Innovation ETF) – 4.3%
	•	AMZN (Amazon) – 4.0%
	•	MSFT (Microsoft) – 3.5%
	•	U (Unity Software) – 2.0%
	•	TSM (Taiwan Semiconductor) – 1.4%

I started this portfolio in June 2024 and have been adding monthly. It’s up about 23% overall. I plan to just hold everything and not sell.

2) At the same time, I recently opened a Roth IRA, and I’m mainly investing in VOO and QQQM there.

Would you say my overall setup is too risky? Should I diversify more into bonds or other ETFs? I’m okay with short-term volatility, but I do want to be smart about long-term balance.

Thanks for any advice or perspective!

235,TSM,China and Taiwan,"I'm sure everyone knows that TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) produces most of the worlds semiconductors. This includes quite possibly the most important company in the US stock market right now, NVIDIA.

Basically the economy of the United States and many other countries depends on this one company. This especially applies to the stock market where for instance NVIDIA itself makes up 8% of the S&amp;P 500. And while NVIDIA and other companies have been trying to use other manufacturers in more recent times like Samsung. TSMC is still the most efficient and most used.

Many analysts suggest that China will invade Taiwan before 2030 (2027 likely) due to many factors like China's aging population. I think it goes without saying there is at least a lot of evidence for this. (ie : the special purpose barges they're building  + all their military drills)

Recently the Trump administration has been striking boats off the coast of Venezuela and there are talks of military strikes on the country. Additionally, Trump has just made a post talking about the possibility of sending troops to Nigeria. In the beginning of the year Trump had other aspirations like potentially annexing Greenland and taking back the Panama Canal. While this has all been happening internal division within the US has only gotten worse (shown by the current 2nd longest government shutdown in history) and the fate of 42 million Americans who receive SNAP benefits is still largely undecided, which will only worsen this issue. Due to all of this I feel the US is spreading itself thin especially militarily.

This is the exact enviroment China would want before they invade Taiwan because they know the US will respond. They might even preemptivley strike US military bases at the start of the invasion to slow our response. In my opinion this is why they've interfered with our elections in recent years; to keep the US angry and divided so our government is more distracted when they strike. You don't just go up against the world's #1 military with no plan. 

If everything goes according to plan and China is able to take Taiwan there are many different things that could happen to TSMC. At the very worst analysts suggest that China could just destroy their semiconductor factories. Another possibility is that TSMC activates their kill switch to prevent their facilities from falling into the hands of China. Obviously no one can tell the future exactly but this still paints a very grim picture for me. 

To me this seems like the thing that will pop the AI bubble. After all big tech companies can't function without semiconductors. Currently there is a US plant being built in Arizona but it's only producing 4 nm chips as of now. Additionally as seen with other companies just because they've built the necessary facilities does not mean they'll be able to produce chips at the necessary rate. There are many supply chains that will need to be set up and many specialized workers that will need to gather experience before the plant is as efficient as it needs to be. Over time the US and other countries will create their own manufacturing facilities and set up new supply chains with countries like Korea, who is the 2nd largest producer of semiconductors. However, the intial impact is predicted to be pretty devastating.

Honestly I'm confused why people don't bring this up more often at least as a possibility seeing how our entire economy/stock market basically relies on this one company to function.

1,TSM,These were my short term predictions for the last 9-10 days. This is why you can’t predict the markets.,"I made predictions for all the stocks in my portfolio. In just 10 days, a lot of them aged badly. To myself, and to you investors, don’t try to predict the market. 

My thesis: **Stock Positions 10/20/2025**

 

**GOOG:** **Hold** after earnings when I will likely buy the stock

**NEM:** While **tariffs devalue the U.S. dollar**, Gold is likely to **see record highs**. Interest rates are declining, which creates more inflation which will likely help NEM, which is a Gold miner, and gold miners are cyclical with the price of Gold. As worse data approaches the stock market (which is likely to come) Gold will keep making record highs.

The USD devaluing + Interest rates likely being cut + an overvalued stock market + most other markets being overvalued is likely to allow NEM and Gold to continue to go up.

Even though NEM has a large connection to Gold, NEM still must abide **by regulations** which could drag down the price, even if Gold is going up. Also, my MSR ratio shows NEM at 82/16 odds, which shows that NEM is highly overvalued on the (D) chart on TradingView.

However, NEM has good leadership, and their **debt has reduced by 8.69B to 7.13B** (as of June 2025). Their debt-to-equity ratio is sound at 0.24.

This is why I will **hold** NEM and wait for more earnings which are on Oct 23 2025

**NFLX:** Likely to continue with strong growth through Q3. Many analysts rate NFLX a buy before earnings and are increasing their price targets, especially after the release of some big hits (Squid Game 3, Kpop Demon Hunters). 

However, NFLX has fallen below its 50-day moving average of tomorrow’s earnings report. This should initiate caution to investors.

Q3 has been a very good season for companies in the S&amp;P 500. Out of the index, **12% of companies have had their earnings, with 86% surpassing expectations**. So far, this has been a fantastic quarter. NFLX is a big company and it’s likely to have a beat as well.

Even though Q3 has been a good performance, **NFLX is exposed to the American consumer**, which if they feel the effects of inflation too harshly, might start to cancel their Netflix subscriptions. Also, Donald Trump, the president of the U.S said that he will **put 100% tariffs** on movies outside of the U.S, which would drastically affect NFLX’s profit margins, because **59% of all Netflix revenue comes from international markets.**

Despite this, I believe that NFLX will continue to thrive and will likely beat earnings. This is why I will **buy** some NFLX before earnings tomorrow.

**MU:** Earnings were fantastic. **Revenue surged up to 37.8B, nearly a 49% increase year-over-year.** Analyst targets range from $240 to $270, which is approximately a 20 – 30% upside.

Although a fantastic earnings report, MU plans to **sever its chip business in China** after its ban in 2023 on its products in infrastructure. While it will still supply some things to China, this will likely, over **the long term hurt, revenue and revenue diversification**. MU has also been facing tariff headwinds **after the U.S added 10% universal tariffs** on all imports, which MU has suffered from.

This is why I will **hold** until geopolitical tensions decrease. **If they increase, I will sell a chunk of my position**. I have already made 33% profit at the time of writing.

**UNH:** One of the biggest healthcare / insurance service companies in the U.S, with exposure across insurance (UnitedHealthcare), health services, data and pharmacy benefits. This means it has multiple levers for revenue and margin improvement. It is an established network, relationships with other companies have been built over many decades (since 1977)

**Investors like Warren Buffett and Michael Burry** have invested billions into UNH, seeing it as undervalued from recent highs. However, there is a reason for UNH being valued as ‘undervalued’.

UNH have been facing rising medical costs, utilization and squeezed margins. The company has faced **a lot of uncertainty**, even at one point **suspending its 1-year outlook**. The company has faced **ongoing scrutiny into the investigation of Medicare billing practices and over adjustments**.

This could bring **potential fines, reputational damages or operational constraints**. **The UNH CEO, who was shot in December 2024** caused turmoil in the company. Even though it’s been nine months since the shooting, it has scarred many investors, and customers about why the CEO was shot, and if UNH is doing bad practices at the company.

For these reasons, I will likely **hold** the stock for the foreseeable future.

**JNJ:** The stock has seen a good Q3 report, **sales up 6.8% year over year**. The growth came from its **“Innovative Medicine” and “MedTech”** segments, so its not overly reliant on one division. JNJ is also pushing new therapies into the markets, so its business is diverse.

JNJ also revised down its **tariff expectations from $400M to $200M**, reflecting improved global trade conditions. The reason why I bought JNJ in the first place was because it was reliable and solid. It helped me hedge against market geopolitical volatility.

Even though I like JNJ stock very much, key drugs **like Stelara (which is a big revenue driver) is losing its exclusivity or facing biosimilar competition** which could erode further revenue. After a strong run for JNJ, positive news might be priced in. Some valuation models say that **JNJ might be 4-5% overvalued** relative to its fundamentals.

**In the worst-case scenario**, if a court hands down a massive talc verdict, or series of judgements JNJ could suffer an **earnings shock, cash flow and reputation**. This should keep investors cautioned of the future of JNJ.

I will **hold** JNJ for these reasons until **further** **notice**.

**BABA:** This stock has a lot of exposure to the AI market, **building the ‘compute’ layer**, which is for LLMs. It is e-commerce, but it could expand into technology through this. The stock has rallied in 2025, and some models **suggest that BABA is still undervalued**. BABA has **substantial cash reserves** for extra projects that could fuel revenue growth.

Geopolitical tensions between the U.S and China has made created trouble for BABA. U.S scrutiny **because of U.S national security** concerns has impacted the valuation of the stock. While AI growth is exciting, Alibaba’s traditional services are under margin pressure. China is **dealing with a slowdown in economic growth, property stress and consumer spending being soft in many areas. Trade tensions may disrupt Alibaba**.

Alibaba is also **viewed as a “comeback” and “transformation story”**, so there are high expectations, like any AI stock. Some analysts suggest most of the good news is already priced in.

This is why I am going to **hold Alibaba until 11/21/2025**, when it has its earnings, and then I will do another analysis on the company then.

**TSM:** This stock **manufactures** a large share of all **the most advanced chips in the world**, for big players **like NVDA and AMD**. Because it has such a large share, it has greater area **for growth and revenue expansion**. TSM has a moat in advanced technology which is extremely hard to replicate.

**The accelerating demand for GPUs, AI accelerators, data centre chips, and related semiconductors benefits TSM**. TSM has had strong recent earnings.

The leading edge that TSM has is **extraordinarily** **expensive to maintain**, for a company like TSM. If demand slows, then as the whole operation is so expensive, it could hurt TSM profitability.

Geopolitical situation in Taiwan is delicate, because **if China declares war on Taiwan, the stock will likely drop a lot**. Cybersecurity and hacking is also meaningful in the semi conductor industry.

Competition to remain the company with the most advanced chips is fierce, with Intel saying it will invest 33B euros and Samsung investing 11 – 16B dollars annually.

I believe that TSM will continue to grow (no signs of growth slowing down) but if the AI bubble pops, and as China – US tensions grow (especially over Taiwan and tariffs) an invasion into Taiwan is not off the table. This is why I am cautious of TSMC’s future prospects. I am planning **to hold and buy small chunks** because of this earnings report and because of Post-Earnings-Announcement-Drift which will likely last a few more weeks.

**MS:** The stock recently had a good Q3 performance, with their investment banking **revenue jumping 44% year over year. MS has also been given more flexibility to deploy capital, increase dividends or make investments, because the Federal Reserve has agreed to lower MS’ “stress capital buffer” from 5.1%, to 4.3% for the upcoming year.**

Morgan Stanley is a big company, which has many diversified operations, like asset management, institutional securities, investment banking, trading and other operations which allows for multiple angles to expand revenue.

However, much of their revenue comes from investment banking, so if just a handful of operations underperform, it could **affect MS and drag on profit margins**. MS is also exposed to the health **of credit markets** and the health of corporates, so if credit defaults rise, MS could face losses.

Morgan Stanely would also be hurt, in the worst-case scenario, by a recession. In a recession, deal making, a large revenue driver would be hurt hart, causing a drag on MS. Given the moderate chance by most institutions of a recession coming in 2025/2026, trimming the position of MS might be a good idea. This is why I will **hold** until **recession fears are larger**.

**JPM:** Similar to Morgan Stanley. I will **hold** until recession fears are larger.

**UBER:** Uber has a **diversified business model**, (uber eats, normal driving, and AI services). This helps mitigate the risks associated with any single revenue stream.

UBER faces regulatory scrutiny because of some drivers not being licensed. In Hong Kong, lawmakers have passed a bill to regulate this. **The FTC has taken action against UBER for deceptive billing and cancellation practices related to its subscription, Uber One**. The legal challenge could result in fines and damage to Uber’s reputation. **Uber faces competition from Deliveroo and Just Eat, especially in the U.K.**

This is why I will likely **hold, and if earnings are bad, sell some of my position.**

**SPGI:** Standard and Poor’s. Had a good Q2 performance of 3.755B, a **6% increase year over year. The company also announced a 1.8B acquisition of With Intelligence, a private markets data provider. This will enhance SPGIs offerings, in the rapidly growing private financial market sector. Analysts maintain a “strong buy” rating for SPGI, with a 12-month price target averaging 609$ indicating a potential upside of \~28%.**

SPGI’s valuations are concerning. **The P/E ratio is at 36.3x,** which is above the industry average of 25.7x. DCF model suggest that a fair, closer value is 288$, indicating the stock may be overvalued. Like MS and JPM, market downturns could reduce demand for SPGI services and seeing as a recession has a moderate chance for 2025/2026, this is a possibility.

Even though SPGI has concerning valuations, I think that I will allocate a large amount of money to SPGI before earnings. Right now, it is down -11% in my portfolio, but to me it, it suggests a buying opportunity, and as the stock has gone down a lot, the expectations for Q3 might be lower**. I will buy moderate chunks more SPGI**. Earnings on the 30^(th) of October 2025

**BKNG:** Earnings on the 28^(th) of October 2025. Booking Holdings has demonstrated **good financial results, with revenue growth being in the travel sector. BKNG is diversified, having many brands such as** [**Booking.com**](http://Booking.com)**, Agoda, KAYAK and OpenTable, providing a broad range of services. The company has operations in 220 countries, meaning that it has a strong global presence.**

Booking Holdings is exposed to currency exchange rate volatility, which may impact revenue. BKNG is also very economically sensitive, so in a recession, it is likely to be impacted very hard. An economic downturn is likely not good for BKNG. **The industry is highly competitive, with players like Expedia, Airbnb and other regional platforms wanting market share. BKNG has a beta of 1.35, so it’s more volatile than other stocks.**

For these reasons, I will buy **a small amount of BKNG before earnings.**

**BRK.B:** 70% increase in profits in operating earnings, driven by a substantial rise in insurance.

Berkshire Hathaway has underperformed the S&amp;P 500. I am not holding it to outperform the S&amp;P 500, I am more holding it as a counterweight to more volatile stocks in my portfolio. Warren Buffet stepped down in 2025 which has been an issue for some investors, but I am confident in the leadership of Greg Abel.

BRK.B is a very small position in my portfolio (because of Warren Buffet stepping down, and that turbulence) but the dust has likely settled, so I will **buy large chunks before earnings** (which is on the 3^(rd) of November, 2025).

**DOW:** This stock has a strong history of dividends, which is why I bought it in the first place. It has a diverse revenue stream from multiple angles.

The company is facing many lawsuits over misleading investors that it could withstand tariffs and sustain dividends. Analysts project that DOW **will  have a loss of 0.31$** a share, a significant decline from the same quarter last year, that yielded positive profit per share.

This is why I will likely **hold DOW through earnings, and see where things stand after earnings.**

**OPEN:** Meme stock / speculative. **Hold / Sell before earnings report with the way things are going.**

**AVGO: Strong Q3 performance, revenue of 15.95B, a 22% increase year over year. AI semiconductor revenue has surged to 63% year over year to 5.2B dollars, marking 10 consecutive quarters of growth.**

AVGO has **a high P/E ratio of 89.3**, amidst this AI bubble, which is **worrying investors**. The company has also **had layoffs affecting sales, customer success, and account management roles, including VMware, which it acquired in late 2023. Even though AVGO had strong revenue, the stock still declined 4% following because it was not a good enough earnings report to please investors.**

This is why I am **likely to hold till the next earnings report**.

**NVDA:** Like AVGO, but they work in slightly different areas. **P/E ratio is 52, and the stock will be a hold until earnings.**

31,TSM,I made a spreadsheet to quickly find good buys,"I created a spreadsheet that uses analyst EPS estimates 2025-2027 to rank stocks on my watchlist. It uses a weighted PEG-ratio of 20% 2025, 50% 2026 and 30% 2027 estimate

I also added SPY and QQQ (green and blue lines) to quickly see which stocks are cheaper when sorting by my weighted metric.

I tried to be conservative on the 2-3 year CAGR on each stock and optimistic on SPY and QQQ to add some margin of safety.

This is work in progress that probably has taken me around 200-300 hours with research, spreadsheet functions, stock analysis etc. I share it with you all for free and would appreciate feedback. Is there something i can add, features or data?

I am working on creating a Price to Free Cash Flow metric that is transformed to a comparable number that can be added to my weighted PEG number

Here is a link to the sheet: https://imgur.com/a/0wwqbdm

To be transparent, i have positions in GOOG, NFLX, AMZN, TSM, UBER. These buys are recent and i used the sheet to find them",151,24,1761483738.0,2025-10-26T13:02:18+00:00,t3_1ogk26b,investing
11,TSM,I’m hanging up the cleats,"I’m hanging up the cleats for now. I entered the market with $700 (every penny in my bank account) in early April and turned that into $2500 from sharkninja calls. I’ve since turned that into over $40k with ups and downs that probably should have given me a heart attack multiple times over. My biggest winners were BABA calls, BYND, and SPY weeklies. My biggest losers were AMD, TSM, and RDDT. If I didn’t revenge trade after losses or panic sell some positions I would probably be sitting on over $100k now. I’m not complaining though. Im thankful to g-d for giving me this opportunity. Im getting out while I’m up. The stress and amount of time I spent on Robinhood is simply too much for me. Maybe I’ll get back in if there’s a clear opportunity down the line. Maybe not. It’s been a wild ride. Thank you WSB, SSB and the broader retail community🫡",151,49,1761439963.0,2025-10-26T00:52:43+00:00,t3_1og7j0i,SmallStreetBets

66,TSM,$50k into T1 Energy - Faker DD - $7+ Breakout,"So I've been watching League of Legends 2025 worlds currently.

T1 did really well in the past, maybe let's ignore 2022 because of the E-girl Faker was rumored to date. But if we jump to 2023, T1 Won Worlds then so their stock price did well reaching $15 a share because of increased skin sales.

In 2024, T1 won worlds again and their stock performance was questionable. Even though Faker had 2 new skins he was able to sell, leading to increased revenue growth, it doesn't look like people were a fan of Yone or Sylas. Mainly because there's two guys, an E-girl skin would sell very well.

It's 2025 now, T1 is in the bring of elimination. But because Faker is known to be clutch I believe T1 will win, causing the T1 energy stock-rice to breakout to $7.00 because of new skin sales.

Even if they dont win, I've also done an analysis on similar companies like TSM. TSM has reached an all time high stock price of $300 a share. But the important thing to note is THEY ONLY did that after they got delisted from the North American League and after their AD carry doubellift retired.

So even if Faker doesn't perform or retires, T1 energy will likely do well anyway. You can see this by the plots above the graph.

Which is why I bought $50k worth of calls. I normally do shares, but everyone told me I'm a loser, so I did calls this time.",788,107,1760996013.0,2025-10-20T21:33:33+00:00,t3_1obuj2z,wallstreetbets
67,TSM,TSMC Earnings loss,"I saw a dip leading up into earnings and bought 5 of these 300c weeklies, rode the runup before earnings and sold the contacts for a profit right before market close on the day of TSMC earnings. When I sold them I figured earnings were priced in, and was happy to take a profit and minimize risk.

Then Thursday morning after earnings, I did the most impulsive retard thing and I re entered the position at market open after seeing the incredible earnings, and seeing that the contracts I had just sold were trading for less than I had sold them for. The price then dropped and I did something even more retarded, I doubled and tripled down on the position throughout the day Thursday.

68,TSM,Last Chance NVTS Lottery Tickets,"TLDR: Navitas is a US-based semiconductor company that uses better power conversion than competitors while demand grows. New designs, major contracts, and upcoming earnings make it a great buy right now unless you’re scared of the casino.

The AI bull run is still showing no signs of stopping. Major names like NVDA and ORCL have largely fulfilled their opportunities to moon at this time, leaving smaller, more speculative companies on the betting table. AI has raised several accompanying sectors in its rally, including companies that feed into its need for power, data centers, and semiconductors.

This is where Navitas Semiconductor (NVTS) comes in. Robinhood leads its description as, “engag[ing] in the development of ultra-efficient gallium nitride (GaN) semiconductors.” GaN semiconductors are the technological successor to silicon power conversion which is quickly becoming antiquated among systems that demand cool, compact, power-efficient semiconductors. 

They are not the first to use GaN technology; however, they do produce the only GaN, fully integrated circuits under their trademark GaNFast™ monolithic integrated chips. This differs from competitors (e.g. IFNNY) because NVTS produces a fully GaN product as opposed to GaN components bottlenecked by silicon parts in the final product.

Another pro is that they work directly with companies to integrate themselves into final products as opposed to being limited by distributors or as components. Essentially, their existing partnerships with big names like Lenovo, Dell, and SolarEdge are designed to work around them—a system design that secures a long-term destiny for the company considering no one can switch away from them on a whim as it would mean completely redesigning their products.

Obviously, their most important deal with Nvidia is the recent milestone that may have put them on some of your radars with them commissioned to provide the semiconductors for their new data centers set to be built in late 2026 or early 2027. The first samples are expected to be shipped sometime this quarter.

With semiconductors being used in just about everything technologically relevant nowadays—computers, phones, EVs—it’s not far-fetched to believe they will be securing additional deals from other big names. They have the most power-efficient system available to date at a time whn every major growth sector is looking for power solutions. 

As for other catalysts, earnings are fast approaching (AH, 11/3) when their revenue has trended up each quarter. Growing geopolitical tensions and administration’s desire to limit offshore dependence may see the power shift from dominant foreign entities like TSM to domestic. The climate is poised to return NVTS to their ATH of $20.16 or well past.

In terms of risk, they are still currently unprofitable entailing some dilution risk. Competition among larger names like Infineon and Texas Instruments is still possible, although my thesis regarding the growing reliance on and demand for GaN suggests the odds are on Navitas’ side.

My recommended position: Jan 16 calls ATM. NVTS more than has the potential to exceed ATH before the end of this year.

June 2024: Bought my first ASTS shares around $9, that’s been my largest holding and biggest mover ever since. Still adding. Also bought 1300 ACHR shares at $3.

October 2024: Hit big on TSM earnings, had a bunch of calls I averaged down on over the summer. Went from -$5k to about +$7k basically overnight.

April 2025: Low point after the election run up and later decline. Biggest mistake I’ve made so far was letting a successful AMZN calls trade basically go to zero. Lesson learned, will always scale in/out moving forward.

May 2025: Entered my GOOG position. Ended up being my most successful options trade, added more calls on dips, always 6+ months out from expiration. This stock was the perfect storm for a quick run up and ultimately went +$30k on the trade. Still holding some.

Today: Currently my largest trades are JD Jan 26 calls and the rest of my GOOG. Sitting on all my ASTS shares and I won’t be selling any time soon. The calls however are +$8k so those I’ll begin to trim.",923,64,1759775833.0,2025-10-06T18:37:13+00:00,t3_1nzrcx6,wallstreetbets

72,TSM,$1.7M INTC bet for NANA,"TLDR: 

Trump will rig $INTC to go up, forcing companies to partner with them and build their foundry business, for national security and his pride.  


INTC has a trump put, if he sees the stock starting to struggle, he will manipulate it back up.  It’s embarrassing for him to buy a stock with the governments money and watch it go down, especially since he’s known as a business man.  A lot of bad press will occur.

WSJ Reports that the Trump Admin has committed to help intel “find new customers to bolster the foundry business”$TSM is at $1T vs $INTC $150b, a lot of room to runA single meaningfully 14a foundry contract by Apple, xAI, open ai, etc will send INTC up 30%+ overnight.  Why would these companies not at least baby commit to this, to appease trump and get favorable treatment in the future?The US is the most powerful country in the world, and to have that in your back pocket of a company is a scary cheat code.  US takes their national security seriously, and they will insure Intel wins.

Reasons for it to go down

Trump announces he doesn’t care about onshoring US semi manufacturing anymore and shifts policy to globalist mentality and allows free trade of semis

US sells 10% stake in INTC

Reasons for it to go up

Announcement of new investor

Announcement of big company supporting intel 
with orders to appease trump

US policy announced about onshoring more US semi manufacturing

Really big call option flow on INTC, a lot
of bets placed in last 2 weeks on calls. ",744,190,1759168633.0,2025-09-29T17:57:13+00:00,t3_1ntp1z6,wallstreetbets

- **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (standard deviation of daily log returns) of the underlying asset and compare that to the current implied volatility (IV) of the option price. We use the same DTE as a look back period. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium associated with the pricing of options (implied volatility).
    
- **Directional Bias:** Ranges from negative (bearish) to positive (bullish) and accounts for RSI, price trend, moving averages, and put/call skew over the past 6 weeks.

- **Priced Move:** given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move.

- **Expiration:** 2025-10-03.

- **Call/Put Premium:** How much extra you are paying for the implied move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean options are ""cheaper."" High numbers mean options are ""expensive.""

- **Efficiency:** This factor represents the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price of the option. It represents how much traders will pay in slippage with a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.

20,TSM,"The market is facing ‘elevated risk into early October,’ according to BTIG","While the market may be poised for even more upside through the end of 2025, there might be some near-term pressure in store, said Jonathan Krinsky, chief market technician at BTIG.

“SPX essentially up 10x since the March ’09 Global Financial Crisis bottom at 666. It’s likely too cute for it to top at exactly 6,666, and we suspect the year finishes higher than that,” he wrote in a note dated Sunday. “Tactically, however, a consolidation makes sense into what is still an extremely weak seasonal stretch.”

Krinsky pointed to an adage on Wall Street known as “sell Rosh Hashanah, buy Yom Kippur,” a strategy that says investors should sell into the Jewish new year and buy after the day of atonement. This year’s period runs from Sept. 22 through Oct. 2.

25,TSM,"The reaction across markets to Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts is often volatility. But on Wednesday, it really seemed like investors didn’t know what to make of the messaging from the central bank.","This lack of clarity regarding how many more rate cuts are in store over the next year raises the likelihood that investors could see more volatility, according to Jack McIntyre, portfolio manager at Brandywine Global.

“There was a significant dispersion in policy views by this Fed for 2026, which probably means more volatility in financial markets next year,” McIntyre said in commentary shared with MarketWatch via email on Wednesday. “Now, we are all back to data dependency, starting with tomorrow’s initial jobless claims.”

34,TSM,Anyone got advice on one of my holdings?,"So I’ve got equity in a stock that’s currently sitting at a lifetime return of 199% for me. It’s up 38%, 71%, 138%, and 87% over the last 1m/3m/1yr/5yr respectively. Absolutely NOT a well known stock. At what point should I cash out on this thing before it crashes or should I keep holding? Should I dump everything I have into this? 

I’ve done rather well for myself with minimal understanding of the intricacies of investing, up a total of 822% according to SoFi, but I dont know how much of that is me dumping a few paychecks into the app. That being said, I’m not well versed in standard practice and this is the first time I’ve ridden a single stock so long for so much positive return so I dont know hat I’m supposed to do at this point. It’s BY FAR my single best investment, easily beating out the NVIDIA and tsm spikes I’ve been able to catch. ",1,24,1758187056.0,2025-09-18T09:17:36+00:00,t3_1nk3gyh,investing
26,TSM,"“There are no risk-free paths now. It’s not incredibly obvious what to do,” Powell said.","What’s more, the central bank gave a hawkish outlook for rates in 2026, where officials are predicting only one more rate cut in the new year, slower than the current market pricing of two-to-three. To be sure, the Fed’s so-called dot plot shows a large variance of opinion for the next year.

“Net, net, Fed officials did not hit the panic button as they chose to cut rates by the smallest possible magnitude at the September meeting,” said Christopher S. Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS. “The one rate cut per meeting pace shows they no longer feel tariff-based inflation is a serious threat and that the economic growth slowdown with companies onboarding fewer new employees is increasingly the bigger risk. Stagflation is out and labor market concerns are moved to the front-burner.”

This follows Shkreli’s successful short on aTyr Pharma, which dropped 80% after failed trial results. Opendoor had surged over 1,500% in the past three months from historic lows, driven by activist Eric Jackson and retail investors in a “meme stock” rally.

Last week, Opendoor named Shopify COO Kaz Nejatian as CEO, reinstated cofounder Keith Rabois as chairman, and brought back cofounder Eric Wu to the board, with Rabois’ Khosla Ventures and Wu investing $ 40M to accelerate growth.

4,TSM,My covered call fiasco,"I know, I know, my fault, not the tool's. I blame myself. Shouldn't have done it; did it for the wrong reasons. Anyway, here is my veritable slew of mostly itm covered calls:

AMD Nov 21 150$ call		-1

AMD Feb 20'26 130$ call	-9

ASML Apr 17'26 880$ call	-1

GOOGL Jan 16'26 235$ call	-3

INTC Dec 19 24$ call		-1

MSFT Dec 19 410$ call		-1

MU Jan 16'26 80$ call		-1

RKLB Dec 19 35$ call		-1

TSM Nov 21 190$ call		-3

So yeah, around 75 000$ itm, to say nothing of the extrinsic value of some of these positions still. And considering the increasing devaluation of the dollar compared to the euro it feels like my principal is on fire while all the upwards movement from said devaluing and inflation is lost for me and just digs me in deeper.

Now, I don't want to lose my shares, as is often the case. The only ones on this list I am fine with selling and infact intend to sell are MU and INTC. I just want to extract the maximum value out of them before doing so. Funilly enough, they are the two posisions where I extra messed up and they are below cost basis which is 130$ and 43$ respectively.

I know, there is no rolling for credit here, is not my intention either. I am fine with rolling for a debit to recover as much as possible. At the same time I want the rate of return from the principal + debit I use to roll to be at least 8% annually to match an all world ETF lets say, ideally 10% minimum cosidering infaltion and devaluation.

If anyone has a strategy/idea to attack these positions I would be happy do discuss. I currently have 3,3k usd i intend to use to roll with. Am not sure which ones to target here. MSFT has currently nearly no extrinsic left so that one is a consideration. At the same time, it has low IV so if I get it to atm i don't really get much cash. I though about doing AMD or TSM, even just one call to nearly atm and then when the extrinsic decays (and it doesn't shoot past that strike as well), I would roll it for the same or higher strike like 3 months out and use the credit from that to save another position. Is what I did with the one odd amd call. 1,9k debit to bring it there and hopefully can roll it for around 1k credit to bring a second one out form underwater. Then in the next cycle use those two and their credit to save another two etc.

MU is obiously completly dead (like 100$ extrinsic on a 8k short call), but I don't care for the position luckily. I could let this one expire and use those 8k to roll the others for a debit. Would be a bit of a last resort as I really don't want to use principal instead of dividends/option premimus from better positions for the rolling.

I don't know, another thing is TSM, which of the ones I care for is the one most underwater; with the strike being 27,71% lower than the current price. Also has high IV, so maybe I have to keep the 3,3k to roll this one out to something a bit more reasonable. Also not sure if I should try rolling GOOGL and ASML out to end of 2026 to as high a strike as possible so they don't get killed as well; they are curerntly close to atm. This would unfortunatly massively decrease the decay of the options though.",13,67,1758051157.0,2025-09-16T19:32:37+00:00,t3_1nirbet,thetagang

237,TSM,Alibaba unveils homegrown AI chip to replace Nvidia’s H20 in China,"No paywall: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chinas-alibaba-develops-ai-chip-090846681.html

(Reuters) -China's Alibaba has developed a new chip that is more versatile than its older chips and is meant to serve a broader range of AI inference tasks, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The chip, now in testing, is manufactured by a Chinese company, in contrast to an earlier Alibaba AI processor that was fabricated by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, the report said.

Alibaba did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Chinese tech and AI companies have been focusing heavily on homegrown technology at a time when leading AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) has faced regulatory issues in selling its products in the country.

Nvidia's H20 chip, the most powerful AI processor it is allowed to sell in China, was effectively blocked from sale in the market earlier this year by the Trump administration.

While the U.S. last month allowed Nvidia to resume sales of H20 to China, Chinese firms have been working on processors that could substitute H20. Beijing has also put pressure on tech giants, including Alibaba and ByteDance, over purchases of the H20 chip.

Nvidia developed the H20 specifically for China following U.S. export restrictions on its other AI processors in 2023. The H20 does not have as much computing power as Nvidia's H100 or its Blackwell series.

Alibaba is China's biggest cloud-computing company and is among the top customers of Nvidia.

Separately, on Friday, the company reported a 26% jump in revenue in its cloud computing segment for the April-June quarter, beating market estimates, on the back of solid demand.",370,147,1756488924.0,2025-08-29T17:35:24+00:00,t3_1n3dv7e,stocks

39,TSM,Rate my 8 week DCA investment plan,"
Hey I’m working on an 8 week DCA plan. I sold some losers (PayPal) and am consolidating my portfolio for MAX CAGR. Thought I’d share my ideas and see if anyone has suggestions. I’ll be deploying weekly. I would include AMD but im overweight already on it.


GOOG 18%
AMZN 18%
META 17%
MSFT 11%
NVDA 8%
ADBE 9%
Healthcare (NVO/LLY/VRTX) 10%
Luxury (RACE/LVMUY) 7%
Semis Adjunct (ASML/TSM) 7%


My thesis is to deploy majority into
PEG-friendly compounders, balance with NVDA/MSFT/ADBE and diversify into semis, healthcare, and luxury. 

Curious how this looks from outside view. Am I too concentrated in big tech or is this a good play for long term growth (I am comfortable with volatility and have a 20+ year investment horizon.

3,TSM,"Applied Materials drops 14%, worst drop since 2020, after weak forecast and China trade concerns","No paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/applied-materials-tumbles-china-woes-103649551.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/applied-materials-tumbles-china-woes-103649551.html)

(Bloomberg) -- Applied Materials Inc. suffered the worst single-day stock decline in five years after giving a disappointing sales and profit forecast, renewing concerns that the US trade dispute with China is weighing on demand.

Revenue will be approximately $6.7 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter, the company said in a statement Thursday. Analysts had estimated $7.32 billion on average. Profit will be about $2.11 a share, excluding some items, compared with a projection of $2.38.

Applied Materials, the largest American producer of chipmaking gear, is seeing less demand from customers in China, Chief Executive Officer Gary Dickerson said in an interview. It also faces delays in approval for exporting technology to that country, he said. Moreover, large customers are putting off some purchases in the face of prolonged negotiations around tariffs and other economic issues.

“It just creates a level of uncertainty,” Dickerson said.

The outlook sent shares of Applied Materials down 14% on Friday, the most since the early days of the pandemic in March 2020. They had been up 16% this year heading into the report.

In the third quarter, which ended July 27, revenue rose 7.7% to $7.3 billion. Analysts had anticipated $7.21 billion on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Profit was $2.48 a share, compared with an estimate of $2.36.

Applied Materials’ customer ranks include some of the biggest names in the chip industry, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Samsung Electronics Co. and Intel Corp. Those manufacturers order gear well ahead of starting production, making Applied Materials’ forecasts a barometer for future demand.

The company said last week that it would participate in an Apple Inc. plan to boost manufacturing in the US by spending more than $200 million on a facility in Arizona. Applied Materials will also sell equipment to Texas Instruments Inc.’s US factories to support Apple products.

“Applied Materials’ decision to be a core member of Apple’s ‘American Manufacturing Program,’ a drive to increase factory production within the US, could strengthen its position as a key supplier of chipmaking tools for advanced semiconductors used in iPhones,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Masahiro Wakasugi said in a note.

“The new administration is very focused on increasing semiconductor supply in the United States,” Dickerson said on Thursday. “We’re very positive.”

In July, rival Lam Research Corp. said revenue for the quarter ending in December would ease from the current-quarter levels, with Chinese customers potentially scaling back after a spending spree.

In a further sign of US-China tensions, Applied Materials was recently sued by Beijing E-Town Semiconductor Technology Co. over what that company characterized as trade secret theft.

Still, Dickerson said the long-term demand outlook for computing power remains strong. Customers in China had significantly ramped up buying in recent years, and are now just digesting those purchases, he said.",166,30,1755309938.0,2025-08-16T02:05:38+00:00,t3_1mrhn9m,wallstreetbets
238,TSM,Trump Administration Eyeing Chips Act Funds for Intel Stake,"&gt;The Trump administration is considering using funds from the US Chips Act to take a stake in the beleaguered American chipmaker Intel Corp., according to people familiar with the discussions.

&gt;The government’s talks focus on using Chips Act funding to at least partially finance an equity stake in Intel, the people said, while emphasizing that discussions are in early stages and other options could be under consideration. It’s unclear if the approach would involve converting some or all of Intel’s existing Chips Act grants into equity, allocating new funding from a broader pool or combining chips act money with other financing streams.

&gt;Intel was already poised to be the biggest beneficiary of money from the Chips Act, having been earmarked for billions of dollars in grants. Under the program, the company was awarded $7.9 billion in grants for commercial semiconductor manufacturing and as much as an additional $3 billion for the Pentagon’s Secure Enclave program. It also has the option to draw on an additional $11 billion in loans under the 2022 law.

&gt;The source of funding, which has not been previously reported, remain in discussion and talks are fluid, the people said, speaking on condition of anonymity to describe private negotiations.Intel Chief Executive Officer Lip-Bu Tan, who met with Donald Trump Monday, is also said to be secure in his position despite the president’s previous criticisms, the people said.The Trump administration is looking to quickly deploy dormant Chips funding to sectors it deems central to US national security, another said.The White House did not respond to a request for comment. The Commerce Department and Intel did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

&gt;Bloomberg reported on Thursday that the Trump administration was weighing a stake in the Santa Clara, California-based company. At the time, a White House spokesperson said any hypothetical deals are speculation until there’s an official announcement.The talks are the latest in a winding saga over the company and its major Ohio chips manufacturing facility, which has been beset by delays. It’s also the latest case of Trump directly inserting himself in industrial policy and looking for a stake or cut in major deals.The talks come just a week after Trump called for the ouster of Tan, accusing him of being “highly conflicted” because of concerns about his earlier ties to China.

&gt;The plans stem from the meeting this week between Trump and Tan, the people said. While the details are still being sorted, the idea is for the US government to pay for the stake, one of the people said. Another cautioned that the plans remain fluid. The talks could still end without an agreement.

&gt;Shares of Intel rose as much as 5.3% after markets opened on Friday.Intel on Thursday declined to comment on the discussions. In a statement, a representative said the company is “deeply committed to supporting President Trump’s efforts to strengthen US technology and manufacturing leadership.”

&gt;**Direct Intervention**

&gt;Any agreement would bolster Intel’s finances at a time when the company has been slashing spending and cutting jobs.

&gt;It’s the latest direct intervention floated by Trump’s administration into a key industry. The administration reached an agreement to receive a 15% cut of certain semiconductor sales to China and took a so-called golden share in United States Steel Corp. as part of a deal to clear its sale to a Japanese rival.

&gt;The Intel idea also echoes the Defense Department’s unprecedented announcement last month that it will take a $400 million preferred equity stake in the little-known US rare-earth producer  - a deal that would make the Pentagon the company’s largest shareholder, with a roughly 15% stake of the firm’s shares. That move turned conventional wisdom on its head among investors, analysts, industry executives and even longtime government officials in terms of how private industry has dealt with the government.

&gt;These unconventional efforts by the federal government also aren’t expected to be one-time deals, Bloomberg News has previously reported, with Trump and his administration adamant about boosting domestic champions in sectors it deems critical to combating China on national security grounds.“In the past few months, we’ve seen the government take a much more active role in engaging the economy, a much more sort of hands-on industrial policy,” said Geoffrey Gertz, senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security. “That appears to be the current direction for US industrial policy in these critical sectors,” he told Bloomberg Television.

&gt;Some deals by the administration are being potentially fashioned on the MP Materials blueprint, one of the people said. That means an equity investment, guaranteed purchases, loans and private financing, alongside government partnership. The view by many within the administration is that such levers give full confidence to investors that a project has the backing of the most creditworthy institution in the world, while also providing cover to taxpayers’ money.

&gt;**Financial Woes**

&gt;A chip industry pioneer, Intel has struggled in recent years, hurt by the loss of market share and its technological edge. Tan’s predecessor, Pat Gelsinger, touted the Ohio factory expansion as part of a comeback plan.But Intel’s financial woes have imperiled the project. Earlier this year, the build-out was delayed until the 2030s, and the company said in July that it would further slow the Ohio plan. Since taking over in March, Tan has focused more on getting Intel’s financial house in order.The Chips Act program has been in flux under Trump.

&gt;Earlier this year, administration officials floated the idea of having chip-production powerhouse Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. operate Intel’s factories as part of a joint venture. But TSMC CEO C. C. Wei has said that his company plans to remain focused on its own business.Trump has won Ohio in all three of his presidential elections, and Republicans flipped a Senate seat there in 2024. Vice President JD Vance served as a senator from the state. Former Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown is seeking election there again next year, making the state something of a battleground once again, though it has trended steadily toward Republicans.

6,TSM,"Trump: “China Deal Is Close” Ahead of EU and Stockholm Trade Talks  Tariffs, Semis, and Rare Earths on the Table","

US President Donald Trump said on Sunday that an agreement with China was “basically” reached, although details remain unclear. His remarks came ahead of high-level talks between China and the US scheduled for Monday in Stockholm, with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng and US Treasury Secretary Scott Pritzker set to lead the discussions.

Extension of the US-China tariff truce agreement (set to expire in mid-August)

U.S. pressure on China over fentanyl and oil imports from sanctioned countries

Rare earths: China's key bargaining chip; critical for electric vehicles, wind energy, and defense technology

Washington's ongoing restrictions on semiconductors related to artificial intelligence

Meanwhile, the EU has accepted a 15% tariff agreement and committed to investing $600 billion, indicating that Trump's hardline trade policy is escalating once again.

If negotiations fail, new tariffs on China's semiconductor, biotechnology, and pharmaceutical industries could take effect by the end of the third quarter.

Markets may not react strongly in the short term, but if tariffs are reimposed, this could severely impact chip manufacturers, multinational corporations, and industrial firms with business ties to China.

43,TSM,TSMC just crushed Q2. Here’s why I’m still holding (and glad I bought the dip at $145),"I’ve had TSM in the portfolio for a while now (wrote a deep dive on it ages ago which still holds up). Earlier this year, when everyone freaked out over tariffs and the stock dipped to \~$145, I flagged it as a chance to load up. I bumped it to over 5% of the portfolio.

Fast forward to Q2 2025 earnings …yeah. No regrets.

The numbers slapped:

* Revenue: $31.67B, up 54% YoY 🤯
* Net income: $9.2B, up 60%
* EPS: $2.47 (beat by $0.16)
* Gross margin: 58.6% (up big from 54.1%)
* Full-year revenue growth now expected to hit 30% (up from 20% earlier)

The stock popped. And it should’ve.

What’s driving it? AI. Lots of it.

TSMC’s HPC segment now makes up 60% of total revenue. That’s up from 52% last year. Meanwhile, smartphones are just 27% of the pie now.

The 3nm node is 24% of wafer revenue already. That’s up from 15% last quarter. Nvidia, AMD, Apple, etc. are all over it. The 5nm node is still king (36%), but 3nm is catching up fast.

Revenue from the U.S. now makes up 75% of total sales. China? Just 9%. So much for “dependence on China.”

Earnings call had some juicy bits too:

Biggest Q&amp;A themes were:

1. Can TSM actually keep up with all this AI demand?
2. When are AI customers moving to bleeding-edge nodes like 2nm and A16?

Management basically said: yes, fabs are ramping, we’re good. And yes, AI clients are *absolutely* moving to the newest stuff sooner due to power efficiency. These data centers eat electricity like crazy. CEO said the biggest constraint for AI players is power. A16 (coming 2026) is supposed to be 20% more efficient than 2nm, which already beats 3nm.

Also, about 30% of their future advanced node capacity will be in Arizona, not Taiwan. That’s a pretty clear signal they’re hedging geo risks.

Couple other things:

* Q3 rev guide: $31.8B to $33B.
* FX headwinds (strong NT$) hit margins a bit, but they still see 53%+ long-term gross margins.
* Capex for 2025: \~$40B.
* They called out tariffs and weak consumer markets as risks, but AI growth more than offsets that

239,TSM,Wall Street steady again after Trump downplays threat to Fed Chair Jerome Powell's job,"Wall Street appears calm after President Donald Trump walked back his earlier threats to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.

Futures for the S&amp;P 500 were unchanged before the opening bell Thursday, while futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.2%. Nasdaq futures rose less than 0.1%, essentially flat.

Trump has harshly criticized Powell and his Fed colleagues for the decision to stand pat on interest rates at a time when the economy is broadly healthy and unemployment is low. Trump's new complaint about Powell  which he says could be grounds for firing the central bank chief  is about cost overruns on the $2.5 billion renovation project at the Fed's Washington headquarters.

Wall Street loves lower rates because they goose prices higher for stocks and other investments, and Trump himself has been clamoring for the Fed to cut more quickly. But Powell has insisted he wants to wait for more data about how Trump’s stiff tariffs will affect the economy and inflation.

Markets, as well as the dollar, took a quick dive Wednesday on reports that Trump was talking about terminating Powell, but largely recovered after he appeared to walk back those sentiments.

A number of companies early in the earnings season have been reporting strong performances, even as they cite uncertainty about the near future due to the potential impacts of Trump's tariffs.

PepsiCo shares rose 2% before the bell Thursday after the beverage and snack giant's second-quarter sales and profit topped Wall Street projections. PepsiCo reaffirmed its April guidance, which projected lower full-year profit than previous forecasts due to increased costs from tariffs and a pullback in consumer spending.

The world’s largest chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), reported huge increases in sales and profit from a year ago, sending its stock up 3.4% in early trading. However, TSMC, a major supplier for Nvidia (NVDA), warned that “uncertainties and risks from the potential impact from tariff policies exist.”

Shares of United Airlines (UAL), which reported after the bell Wednesday, dipped 1.6% overnight after the carrier's second-quarter revenue came in a touch lower than expected. United also cut its full-year profit guidance.

Also falling early Thursday are shares of Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM) and Ingredion, makers of high fructose corn syrup. President Donald Trump said Wednesday that Coca-Cola has agreed to use real cane sugar in its flagship soft drink in the U.S. at his suggestion  though the company has yet to confirm that.

Ingredion tumbled almost 6% early Thursday, and Archer-Daniels-Midland fell 3%.

TAIPEI (Reuters) -TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, posted a 60.7% jump in second-quarter net profit on Thursday, beating market forecasts and hitting a historic high as it benefited from surging demand for semiconductors used in artificial intelligence applications.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, whose customers include Apple and Nvidia, saw April-June net profit rise to T$398.3 billion ($13.53 billion).

The profit handily beat a T$377.9 billion LSEG SmartEstimate, which is weighted toward forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate.

Is the market really this bullish on it right now?

I’m pretty much locked in on adding it to my top 10  maybe even top 5 stocks to buy right now.

Curious to hear what the Reddit crew thinks. Appreciate any takes!

35,TSM,Hybrid earnings play on TSM,"So, I combined a few things to create a minimal loss combo pre-earnings on TSM. 

TL;DR: Skip to the end

Now, I still have a good chance to lose if it moves down sharply, but not much. I have about $100 in call credit spreads $10 above the money, $50 in put credit  $10 below the money, and a call debit  spread that cost $173. If it doesn’t move much, I get $150 from the credit spreads to nearly fully hedge the debit spread. If it goes sky high, the debit spread pays $327 and I lose a maximum of $400 on the call credit spreads (very unlikely though) and gain $50 on the put credit spread making yet another roughly neutral outcome ($400-$377). 

Now, if it plummets, that’s the weak point (but also the least likely scenario). I can lose $200 on the put credit spread and lose the $173 call, but it’s slightly buffered by the $100 call credit spread, making a maximum loss of $273…

That said, had I bought the cheapest call available, that would have cost me over $450, so the very worst outcome is still better than just buying a call and seeing it get crushed.

Meanwhile, the ideal outcome is a modest gain of $2 after market or up to $7 bringing the price to $240 per share for a maximum gain of $477 ($327 from the debit spread + $150 from the credit spreads).

So all in all…
Max gain: $477
Max loss: $273
Likelihood of profit: anything except plummeting
Purpose: circumvent the IV crush after earnings, increasing probability of success with minimal capital and minimum risk.

Essentially - a modified condor with a debit spread for bullish bias.",1,1,1752706292.0,2025-07-16T22:51:32+00:00,t3_1m1r5u3,SmallStreetBets

- **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (standard deviation of daily log returns) of the underlying asset and compare that to the current implied volatility (IV) of the option price. We use the same DTE as a look back period. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium associated with the pricing of options (implied volatility).
    
- **Directional Bias:** Ranges from negative (bearish) to positive (bullish) and accounts for RSI, price trend, moving averages, and put/call skew over the past 6 weeks.

- **Priced Move:** given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move.

- **Expiration:** 2025-07-03.

- **Call/Put Premium:** How much extra you are paying for the implied move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean options are ""cheaper."" High numbers mean options are ""expensive.""

- **Efficiency:** This factor represents the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price of the option. It represents how much traders will pay in slippage with a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.

241,TSM,US Prepares Action Targeting Allies’ Chip Plants in China (WSJ),"By Liza Lin, Amrith Ramkumar and Raffaele Huang

(Wall Street Journal) -- A U.S. official told top global semiconductor makers he wanted to revoke waivers they have used to access American technology in China, people familiar with the matter said, a move that could inflame trade tensions.

Currently, South Korea's Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix as well as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing enjoy blanket waivers that allow them to ship American chip-making equipment to their factories in China without applying for a separate license each time.

Jeffrey Kessler, head of the unit in charge of export controls at the Commerce Department, told the three companies this week he wanted to cancel those waivers, according to people familiar with the meetings. They said Kessler described the action as part of the Trump administration's crackdown on critical U.S. technology going to China.

If carried out, the move could be disruptive both diplomatically and economically. Earlier this month, the U.S. and China agreed to a fragile trade truce in London. Part of the deal involved each country agreeing to hold off from introducing new export controls and other measures designed to hurt the other.

The action isn't a new trade escalation but would be designed to make the licensing system for chip equipment similar to what China has in place for rare-earth materials, White House officials said. The U.S. and China continue to make progress on completing the agreement they reached in London and negotiating on trade, they said.

""Chip makers will still be able to operate in China. The new enforcement mechanisms on chips mirror licensing requirements that apply to other semiconductor companies that export to China and ensure the United States has an equal and reciprocal process,"" a Commerce Department spokesman said.

A new step making it harder for global chip makers to operate in China might still strike Beijing as a betrayal of the London deal. It could also strain the relationship between Washington and friendly governments in South Korea and Taiwan, whose companies would be most affected and have promised large investments in the U.S. in recent years.

The Chinese factories in question -- including a Samsung memory-chip factory in the Chinese city of Xi'an -- are part of the global supply chain for memory, logic and other chips. While they generally don't have the most advanced technology, the factories' output is widely used in cars, consumer electronics and the like.

Industry officials said tighter curbs by Washington wouldn't immediately force the factories to shut down, but over time, they could find it harder to operate effectively. That would disrupt global industry as companies are dealing with other issues triggered by the U.S.-China trade war, such as China's limits on exports of rare-earth magnets.

The chip makers would likely seek case-by-case licenses from the U.S. government to supply their Chinese factories, while looking to replace U.S. equipment with alternatives from Japan and Europe.

People involved in the discussions said revoking the waivers isn't a done deal.

They said Kessler's unit -- the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security -- hasn't secured buy-in from other parts of the U.S. government, such as the Defense Department. Opponents in the administration worry eliminating the waivers would ultimately end up boosting Chinese companies and give China control of the plants.

Kessler and other national-security hawks have taken a hard line on cutting off China from American technologies, arguing that aggressive measures are needed to limit the country's advances in critical sectors and spur development of supply chains outside China. Those efforts have put them in conflict with pro-business officials.

In recent weeks, the administration has halted sales to China of more high-end chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices. That has dented the U.S. companies' revenue by billions of dollars. Commerce also weighed broad restrictions on sales of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China, although a White House official said that move was no longer under consideration.

The South Korean and Taiwanese companies have notified authorities in their home regions about the waiver issue, hoping for help lobbying against the move, people familiar with the discussions said.

Both South Korea and Taiwan are negotiating broader trade deals with Washington, part of a wave of agreements the Trump administration hopes to wrap up in the coming weeks.

The companies see their Chinese factories as important for competing against Chinese rivals, which are looking to win more global business as chip suppliers. Samsung's current U.S. waiver has allowed its Xi'an plant to make some advanced products that compete against China's Yangtze Memory Technologies, among others.

South Korea, a U.S. military ally, and Taiwan have worked with the U.S. in its technology race with China, including by limiting transfer of advanced technology to China. TSMC, Samsung and SK Hynix have all made multibillion-dollar investments in U.S. factories with backing from Washington.",124,27,1750431289.0,2025-06-20T14:54:49+00:00,t3_1lg60qm,stocks

242,TSM,Taiwan Semiconductor’s May sales jump 39.6% as AI demand stays strong,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC), the primary chip supplier to Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL), reported a 39.6% year-over-year rise in May revenue as clients rushed to stockpile chips amid growing trade tensions.

The company generated NT$320.5 billion ($10.7 billion) in revenue last month. While this marks a strong annual increase, it's an 8.3% decline from April, when TSMC saw a sharper 48.1% year-over-year gain.

Revenue for January through May 2025 totaled NT$1,509.34 billion, an increase of 42.6% compared to the same period in 2024.

Looking ahead, analysts project a 50.3% Y/Y increase in TSMC's second-quarter sales, signaling continued robust demand despite month-over-month volatility.

TSMC chief executive and Chairman C.C. Wei said last week that the demand for the company's AI chips continues to outweigh supply.

The chipmaker reported strong Q1 results in April and issued a positive outlook for the coming years. ""We continue to observe robust AI related demand from our customers throughout 2025.

243,TSM,Broadcom Introduces Latest Networking Chip to Accelerate Artificial Intelligence,"Broadcom Corp. said on Tuesday that it has begun shipping its latest networking chip designed to accelerate artificial intelligence.

The chip, called Tomahawk 6, doubles the performance of its predecessor and has other traffic control features that make the networking chip significantly more efficient, Ram Velaga, Broadcom's senior vice president, said in an interview with Reuters on Monday.

The increase in speed means fewer network switches are needed to perform the same tasks, Viraga said.

Broadcom's networking chips are becoming increasingly important because of artificial intelligence. In building the data centers needed for AI applications, infrastructure builders must string together hundreds or even thousands of chips.

Building large-scale clusters of networking chips requires specialized networking devices and chips, of which the Tomahawk family of processors is one.

With the Tomahawk 6, Broadcom's engineers have increased its speed and functionality to the point where it can be used to build the larger data centers needed for AI, which can daisy-chain more than 100,000 graphics processors (GPUs), Viraga said.

In a few years, he said, “you'll see a million GPUs housed in one physical building.”

Broadcom's networking chips use the Ethernet networking protocol, which has been a networking standard for decades. NVIDIA makes hardware that uses technology from its competitor InfiniBand, as well as several Ethernet-based products.

“All of these networks can be implemented very simply over Ethernet without the need for esoteric technology,” Velaga said.

The Tomahawk 6 is the first product in the series to combine multiple chipsets into a single package, a technology known as “chiplets” that has been widely adopted by other chip design companies such as AMD. Velaga said the addition of chiplets roughly doubles the amount of silicon area used in a design. Velaga said the addition of the chiplet roughly doubled the area of silicon used in the design.

Broadcom is using Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's three-nanometer process to produce Tomahawk switches.",14,2,1748957211.0,2025-06-03T13:26:51+00:00,t3_1l2bvc2,stocks

BEIJING/TAIPEI (Reuters) -Nvidia will launch a new artificial intelligence chipset for China at a significantly lower price than its recently restricted H20 model and plans to start mass production as early as June, sources familiar with the matter said.

The GPU or graphics processing unit will be part of Nvidia's latest generation Blackwell-architecture AI processors and is expected to be priced between $6,500 and $8,000, well below the $10,000-$12,000 the H20 sold for, according to two of the sources.

The lower price reflects its weaker specifications and simpler manufacturing requirements.

It will be based on Nvidia's RTX Pro 6000D, a server-class graphics processor and will use conventional GDDR7 memory instead of more advanced high bandwidth memory, the two sources said.

They added it would not use Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co's advanced Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate (CoWoS) packaging technology.

The new chip's price, specifications and production timing have not previously been reported.

The three sources Reuters spoke to for this article declined to be identified as they were not authorized to speak to media.

An Nvidia spokesperson said the company was still evaluating its ""limited"" options. ""Until we settle on a new product design and receive approval from the U.S. government, we are effectively foreclosed from China's $50 billion data center market.""

TSMC declined to comment.

China remains a huge market for Nvidia, accounting for 13% of its sales in the past financial year. It's the third time that Nvidia has had to tailor a GPU for the world's second-largest economy after restrictions from U.S. authorities who are keen to stymie Chinese technological development.

After the U.S. effectively banned the H20 in April, Nvidia initially considered developing a downgraded version of the H20 for China, sources have said, but that plan didn't work out.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said last week the company's older Hopper architecture - which the H20 uses - can no longer accommodate further modifications under current U.S. export restrictions.

Reuters was unable to determine the product's final name.

Chinese brokerage GF Securities said in a note published on Tuesday that the new GPU would likely be called the 6000D or the B40, though it did not disclose pricing or cite sources for the information.

According to two of the sources, Nvidia is also developing another Blackwell-architecture chip for China that is set to begin production as early as September. Reuters was not immediately able to confirm specifications of that variant.

Nvidia's market share in China has plummeted from 95% before 2022, when U.S. export curbs that impacted its products began, to 50% currently, Huang told reporters in Taipei this week. Its main competitor is Huawei which produces the Ascend 910B chip.

Huang also warned that if U.S. export curbs continue, more Chinese customers will buy Huawei's chips.

The H20 ban forced Nvidia to write off $5.5 billion in inventory and Huang told the Stratechery podcast on Monday that the company also had to walk away from $15 billion in sales.

The latest export restrictions introduced new limits on GPU memory bandwidth - a crucial metric measuring data transmission speeds between the main processor and memory chips. This capability is particularly important for AI workloads that require extensive data processing.

Investment bank Jefferies estimates that the new regulations cap memory bandwidth at 1.7-1.8 terabytes per second. That compares with the 4 terabytes per second that the H20 is capable of.

GF Securities forecast the new GPU will achieve approximately 1.7 terabytes per second using GDDR7 memory technology, just within the export control limits.

245,TSM,Megacap tech adds more than $800 billion in market cap after U.S.-China tariff pause,"Members of the so-called Magnificent 7 group added an aggregate $837.5 billion in market value on Monday after the U.S. and China agreed to pause most tariffs on each other’s goods.

It marked the largest collective move for the group since April 9.

Technology stocks — such as semiconductor firms and smartphone makers — have been hit hard as trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies threatened to disrupt supply chains and hurt some of the biggest U.S. businesses.

But investors breathed a sigh of relief after talks between the U.S. and China over the weekend yielded a temporary pause in “reciprocal” tariffs.

In the U.S., Nvidia, which still faces a number of restrictions on the chips it is allowed to ship to China, was around 5% higher on Monday, while AMD was also up about 5%. Broadcom rose around 6% higher, while Qualcomm added about 5%.

Other companies in the semiconductor supply chain also jumped. Marvell, which last week postponed a previously scheduled investor day due to macroeconomic uncertainty, surged 8%.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s largest chipmaker, saw its U.S.-listed shares jump around 6%. TSMC’s Taiwan-listed stock closed before the tariff announcement.

In Europe, ASML, a supplier of critical machinery required to manufacture the most advanced chips, rallied 6%. Infineon was also sharply higher.

Semiconductors and some electronics received an exemption from President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs last month, but the U.S. signaled the reprieve was temporary and that these products could still be in line for special duties.

Investors have been concerned about the impact on major tech stocks, especially those with exposure to China such as Apple and Amazon, whose shares have been under pressure this year.

Apple, which still makes 90% of its iPhones in China, said during its earnings report this month that it expects tariffs will add $900 million to its costs for the current quarter. Apple shares rose about 6%.

Amazon jumped 8% on Monday. Many sellers on Amazon rely on Chinese products.

U.S.-listed Chinese tech stocks also surged. Chinese e-commerce giants Alibaba and JD.com were higher, alongside internet firm Baidu.

“With US/China clearly on an accelerated path for a broader deal we believe new highs for the market and tech stocks are now on the table in 2025 as investors will likely focus on the next steps in these trade discussions which will happen over the coming months,” Daniel Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, said in a note on Monday.

“This morning is a huge win for the bulls and a best case scenario post this weekend in our view.”

14,TSM,Why I am extremely bullish,"I know this may contradict prevailing sentiment but I hope you can at least hear me out. I’ve been buying the tariff dip on margin, with $1.4 million invested in blue chip stocks. I’m up 46% in the past month. My largest buys have been in TSM, NVDA, ORCL, CAVA, AMZN, MSFT, META &amp; SMH.

1. Largest tax cut in history is coming. Republicans own the house and senate, and Trump is deadset on cutting taxes by $5 trillion. Obviously not good for the national debt but that will juice the economy big time. 

2. Midterms are coming in 2026, and Trump will not want to have a recession on his hands which would risk him loosing the house and senate. I am fully convinced he launched this tariff war so early on, so he could get it over with before midterms. Trump has pivoted extremely quickly on all reciprocal tariffs aside from china. And he is desperate to start negotiations with china. China and the U.S have both entered a de escalatatory tone, with both sides  making exemptions to tariffs, china expressing willingness to deal with fentanyl, and acknowledging the desire to negotiate- along side acknowledging that the U.S has reached out to them. They are BOTH eager to water down these tariffs and deep down, when both parties want the same thing (reduced tariffs) they will find a way to get it despite all the public bluster. Even if a deal could take months, they will likely have a pause either during or before negotiations. 


3. Rate cuts are coming later this year. It’s likely there will be at least 2 rate cuts before year’s end assuming tariff inflation does not cause extreme inflation. Rate cuts will boost the ability to borrow capital, increase liquidity and stimulating the economy. 

4. We are at the dawn of the largest productivity revolution in history. Everyone has seemed to forget about AI despite big tech earnings and guidance blowing it out of the park. MSFT, GOOG, and META are printing money, and AI is showing incredible returns in the semiconductor and data center space. We are still in the early stages of AI, the smarter it gets the more productivity will increase. 

5. The economy is currently strong. Jobs numbers in April (not a lagging indicator) were impressive. At the end of the day, so long as people are not losing their jobs the U.S consumer will stay resilient. Tariff effects could disrupt that if they stay in effect long term. However I think it’s pretty obvious the worst of the tariffs are temporary. 

6. U.S exceptionalism is nowhere close to ending. We are miles ahead of every other economy in terms of innovation and technology. We lead in services, and nobody is boycotting GOOG, META, MSFT etc in a significant way. These innovative tech companies exist nowhere else in scale and success. Our consumer is 30% of the global economy and nowhere do they have such a wealthy large pool of consumers. We are still the world reserve currency with 59% of currency held abroad is dollars. And nobody, even Trump will let us lose that reserve currency status.",0,159,1746364933.0,2025-05-04T13:22:13+00:00,t3_1kejoo0,stocks

42,TSM,Rivian Potential,"I'm brand new to the stock market. Invested 1K in the dip with AI (NVDA, BABA, TSM). Having lived through a few economic catastrophes (dot com, 2008, etc) I decided to jump in this time. I've actually found this to be a fun hobby with the potential to ensure I have a nice nest egg for retirement in 15 years.

In my exploration and desire to diversify I've come to like Rivian and have also bought a few shares. Curious about others thoughts on this before I invest more.

248,TSM,Breaking News: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing unveils ambitious expansion plans for Phoenix complex,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. outlined ambitious expansion plans for its $165 billion chip-making complex in north Phoenix, with the company’s CEO praising production quality at the plant as comparable to that in Taiwan.

Chairman and CEO C.C. Wei also said TSMC isn’t engaged in discussions with any other companies regarding a joint venture or technology licensing, transfer or sharing agreements, quashing unsubstantiated rumors that TSMC was mulling a possible deal with Intel, which operates a large chipmaking complex in Chandler.

Wei’s comments came in a call during which the company reported net income of roughly $11 billion on revenue of $25.5 billion for the first quarter of 2025. Those figures were up 60.3% and 41.6%, respectively, compared to the first quarter of 2024.

Wei alluded to his recent visit with President Donald Trump at the White House, when TSMC announced its intention to invest an additional $100 billion in the Phoenix complex north of Loop 303, raising its total commitment here to $165 billion. The investment aligns with Trump's goal of bringing more manufacturing, especially in advanced industries, back to American soil.

The expansion calls for three additional factories or “fabs,” which will increase the total in Phoenix to six, plus two advanced packaging fabs and a major research and development center. Packaging refers to the process of protecting and interconnecting semiconductors with one another and with other components. The additional investment supports “strong multiyear demand from our customers,” Wei said.

15,TSM,First time wipeout,"Welp, by the 4/17 date I think my account will be wiped out or i guess the official term is blown up.

Now to be fair, i didn't go into stupid and put my life savings, still 10% still is enough to hurt. I was planning on doing paper trading for 4 months but after my first week when i saw paper trading (last week of august aka pump before the dreaded september), when i hit about 60% i said fuck it and used some money instead (i know i got ahead of myself but still)

Anyways, some things i learned the hard way like don't buy so OTM and have a strategy even something as simple as trendline or price action. For a while it worked and when it didn't work it was because of my own stupid greed

That being said, maybe it is cope and someone stop me and reprimand me if you must but i could NOT have seen this deepseek in januray (wiped my nvda and tsm calls) and then the tariff shenanigans had so many ups and downs that whether you did a put or call you were likely fooked. All in all, while i do share the blame of my failures for the veterans here, would you say that the ridiculous times we are in would have wiped out even the most seasoned and disciplined trader or i was too much of a newb whether the market was stable or not? 

Edit: constructive feedback would be appreciated (i am fine with criticism if there is a feedback showing what i could have done right)

Also i didn't mention it but i have done stocks for somet yome and been relatively decent with it (roughly 10% or so annual ROI). So that's a bit of additonal context ",7,25,1744727086.0,2025-04-15T14:24:46+00:00,t3_1jzt6n8,options

15,TSM,TSMC stock price across exchanges,"TSMC is trading in NY under the TSM ticker priced as of now at USD 157.

In Taipei it is traded under the 2330 ticker priced today at TWD 865 (USD 26.7)

Now, TSMC's ADR (TSM) is backed by 5 shares of its primary listing on the Taipei Stock Exchange (2330.TWSE). So, the price in NY should be 26.7 x 5 = 133.5 USD.

My questions are:

1. The difference between 133.5 and 157 is just the risk premium of having the stock in an unfavorable location with a more difficult access?
2. Considering that we are talking about the same company, why there is no arbitrage? Especially from the ADR provider.
3. If something very bad would happen to Taiwan, TSMC (stock) would be affected in the same manner no matter where it is traded, right? (I am thinking about extreme scenario: total destruction. Or I could think about a very positive scenario where substantial dividends are being paid).
4. Am i missing something that makes my calculation above wrong?

2,TSM,TSM: My Highest Conviction Buy — Despite the Tariff and China Risk,"Hi all, 

I have been following TSMC for years, and it is my highest conviction buy...even in the tariff situation. TSMC has a technical monopoly on the most advanced chips in the world. TSMC has pricing power, and the demand for those chips will explode, driven by the increased demand for AI, cloud services and EV adoption. 

I value the shares at $338, more than double the current price. The opportunity exists because the market is discounting the stock price to account for the China and tariffs risks. The market thinks China taking over Taiwan is a real risk. I believe that the risk is overblown as the US won’t allow China to conquer Taiwan.

Any thoughts?

246,TSM,"Trump Exempts Phones, Computers, Chips From Tariffs","https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-12/trump-exempts-phones-computers-chips-from-reciprocal-tariffs

President Donald Trump’s administration exempted smartphones, computers and other electronics from its so-called reciprocal tariffs, potentially cushioning consumers from sticker shock while benefiting electronics giants including Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co.

The exclusions, published late Friday by US Customs and Border Protection, narrow the scope of the levies by excluding the products from Trump’s 125% China tariff and his baseline 10% global tariff on nearly all other countries.

The exclusions would apply to smartphones, laptop computers, hard drives and computer processors and memory chips. Those popular consumer electronics items generally aren’t made in the US. Setting up domestic manufacturing would take years.

The products that won’t be subject to Trump’s new tariffs also include machines used to make semiconductors. That would be important for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which has announced a major new investment in the US as well as other chipmakers.

The tariff reprieve may prove fleeting. The exclusions stem from the initial order, which prevented extra tariffs on certain sectors from stacking cumulatively on top of the country-wide rates. The exclusion is a sign that the products may soon be subject to a different tariff, albeit almost surely a lower one for China.

One such exclusion was for semiconductors, to which Trump has regularly pledged to apply a specific tariff. He hasn’t yet done so but the latest exclusions appear to correspond with that exemption. Trump’s sectoral tariffs have so far been set at 25%, though it’s not clear what his rate on semiconductors and related products would be.

*Out of 1,034 stocks traded on the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE), a total of 945, including contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), fell by the maximum 10 percent amid concerns that the tariffs could undermine global trade, dealers added.*

*The Taiex, the TWSE's benchmark weighted index, ended down 2,065.87 points, or 9.7 percent, at 19,232.35 after moving between 19,212.02 and 20,153.57.*

*It was the first time the index had closed below the 20,000-point mark since Aug. 5, 2024, when it ended at 19,830.88.*

*Monday's losses were the steepest ever in the Taiex's history, smashing the previous record of 1,807.21 also seen on Aug. 5, 2024, when disappointing U.S. data prompted investors to worry about the economy.*

**Despite the sell-off, turnover on the local market totaled only NT$147.295 billion (US$4.44 billion), the lowest single day total in more than two years.**

**""The low turnover showed many investors were reluctant to buy the dip as they expect more losses to follow due to the tariff shocks,"" Mega International Investment Services analyst Alex Huang said.**

*On April 2, Trump announced a 10 percent baseline tax on imports from most countries, with the exception of Russia, North Korea, Cuba and Belarus, starting April 5.*

*Countries with larger trade surpluses with the U.S. will face higher tariffs starting April 9, including Taiwan (32 percent), China (34 percent), Japan (24 percent), South Korea (26 percent), Vietnam (46 percent) and Thailand (37 percent).*

*China took retaliatory action soon after Trump's newest move.*

*""The 32 percent tariff Taiwan faces went beyond what the market had expected, in particular after TSMC pledged (in March) to pour an additional US$100 billion into Arizona in support of Trump's advocacy for investment in the U.S. market,"" Huang said.*

*TSMC, the most heavily weighted stock here, plunged 10 percent to close at NT$848.00, contributing more than 750 points to the Taiex's decline and contributing to a 9.71 percent decline in the electronics index.*

**""Orders to sell an additional 68 million TSMC shares failed to find buyers today. More selling will follow after the market opens tomorrow as investors fear Trump's tariffs will boost inflation and lead to a recession,"" Huang said.**

…

*Huang said non-tech heavyweights also came under heavy pressure, pushing the Taiex down further.*

*""There are few signs of any immediate rebound as the Taiex, which resumed trading today after the last session on April 2, needs to incur more losses to match global volatility,"" Huang said. ""So a similar trading pattern is likely for tomorrow.""*

*Measures to curb short selling were put in place before trading Monday and will remain in effect through Friday in a bid to calm the market, though it made little impact Monday.*

News: [Trump's Tariff Announcement](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2025-04-02/trump-s-tariff-announcement)

[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&amp;p=d)\- 34% tariff on Chinese imports, adding to existing duties, brings the total to 54% effective April 9. AAPL relies heavily on Chinese manufacturing, and these tariffs are expected to lead to increased production costs, which will be passed on to consumers through higher prices. Watching $200, but likely the stock I'm going to play if there's any chance of a bounce (in addition to NVDA). These tariffs will result in retaliatory measures from China, further impacting Apple's supply chain and profitability. Additionally, prolonged tariffs could lower consumer demand due to higher prices. Related Tickers: AVGO, SWKS, TSM, QCOM.

This potential partnership is huge because it means that CRWV has a little more diversification in their revenue stream (alleviating a huge risk to the company). It's hard, this has risen so much from the IPO but we're back at pre-tariff and pre-announcement prices- have a small long position but likely will exit due to all the craziness today and need to focus on the bigger fish. Despite Taiwanese chips not being tariffed, CRWV will likely benefit due to the rising costs of chips- it pushes companies to be more incentivized to rent for the short term.

# A Crash Course on Genetic Optimization

The answer to how I created the best trading strategy in the world is just three words.

Multiobjective genetic optimization.

To understand *how* genetic optimization created this strategy, you first need to understand what genetic optimization (or a genetic algorithm) actually means.

Genetic algorithms (GAs) are biologically inspired, artificial intelligence algorithms. Unlike large language models, GAs specialize in finding non-conventional solutions to hard problems thanks to its ability to find solutions to non-differentiable objective functions.

What does this jargon mean? We’ll talk about it later, but first, let’s create our strategy.

# Creating the world’s best mean-reverting strategy

[Pic: The optimization config. We can change the start date, end date, population size, number of generations, and the fitness functions](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*ylK9g9zbF0UaB-IEDYqKuQ.png)

To create this strategy, we’re going to run a genetic optimization using the “Optimize” button.

Before clicking it, we’ll update the config to be as follows:

* The **start date** will be 01/01/2022. This is the same date where we fetched the original list of stocks
* The **end date** will be 04/01/2024. Again, this is the same end date we described in the previous article
* The **population size** is 25
* The **number of generations** is 25
* The **objective functions** are percent change and sortino ratio, which means we will create a strategy that is strictly better in these two metrics over the training data
* We’ll update the **simulated stock trading fee to 0.5%**. This is an approximation of slippage and will discourage the strategy from making tons of buys and sells unless it truly makes sense

We’ll then click the giant submit button, running our complex optimization algorithm. What this will do is:

* Take historical price and fundamental data from the start date to the end date
* Create 24 more random individuals
* Run the genetic optimization algorithm on these individuals to create the world’s best trading strategy (based on sortino ratio and percent change)

[Pic: Launching a genetic algorithm](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*d_D90PGPdVqea_ZcASiGxg.png)

How does this work? To properly use these improved strategies, we should first understand how they work under the hood.

# A Deeper Dive on Genetic Algorithms

In order to fully understand how multi objective-genetic algorithms can create the best trading strategy in the world, you have to be able to wrap your mind around how genetic algorithms work, and how training them differs from training other types of AI models like ChatGPT.

**A Crash Course on Deep Learning**

AI models like ChatGPT are called “large language models”. I studied other type of language models extensively when taking a class called *Intro to Deep Learning* at Carnegie Mellon.

Don’t let the name of this class fool you — it was extremely hard. In this class, I learned all about the attention mechanism, and how it is used to allow these models to understand the relationship between words.

To train these models, we essentially start with a random dogpile of words. Note that this is an oversimplification; in reality, we start with tokens, and and each token represents a fragment of the word.

For example, to start, the token representation might mean something like:

&gt;asj3 2=% iwu7\^ 1h4p%3 =0sid$ su7//’” uyifa78fo 2i24$19\`

Then we basically take a bunch of regular English sentences taken from the internet on places like Reddit, or from extracting the words from videos on YouTube. We create a (very very complicated) mapping called a neural network that maps the words to the words later in the sentence. Then, we tell the model to learn language.

Specifically, given the sentence:

&gt;NexusTrade is the

The model will learn what the next word *probably is* based on its occurrence in the training set. Words like ‘best’, ‘greatest’, and ‘easiest’ will have a higher probability, and words like ‘worse’ and ‘useless’ will have a lower probability.

Afterwards, we give it a score depending on how well it guessed the right word.

Then, from this score, we compute how off the model is from the training set distribution, and work to minimize how wrong it is. This works by using an algorithm called **gradient descent**, which comes with many assumptions about how language — or finance — can be modeled.

[Pic: A robot walking down a hill; this is similar to how gradient descent works. We find the minimum by adjusting the weights of the map little by little based on how much closer we get to the bottom of the valley, which is essentially the lowest “error” or deviation from the training set](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*efJoamc7lMfpFVWtjh4m1g.png)

For example, one of these assumptions for trading might be that you can get closer to predicting tomorrow’s price based on how well you predicted today’s price.

Returning to our language example, after 5 generations, the model might output:

&gt;NxxxTr8de izzzzz the best pl&amp;fo#m 344 ret\*ail invewsotrs…

And after 50 generations, it might output:

&gt;NexusTrade is the best platform for retail investors…

This description is extremely simplified. In reality, the process of training an AI model is extremely complicated, requiring tokenization, generative pre-training (which I described here), and reinforcement learning via human feedback. They also require terabytes to petabytes of data.

In contrast, genetic algorithms work a lot differently. They don’t rely on calculus or make assumptions that the best answer is close to the current answer. And they also don’t require nearly as much data. Here’s how they work.

# How do genetic algorithms work?

Genetic algorithms work by mimicking the biological process of natural selection. Starting with a random strategy, we will create an entire population of strategies which are essentially extremely highly mutated versions of the strategy. We’ll then test every strategy in the population’s performance.

When we test for performance, we can test for whatever metric we want. This includes metrics that aren’t easily improved by algorithms like gradient descent, such as the number of trades or risk-adjusted returns. It can literally be anything… as long as it is quantifiable.

And then the way we improve the strategy couldn’t be any different.

Instead of incrementally moving closer and closer to a better prediction, we evaluate every strategy on our multiple dimensions. In this example, we’ll choose percent change and sortino ratio.

Then, we’ll create a new population of strategies, coming from combining other decent strategies together, and making (sometimes random) changes to their resulting offspring.

**What this looks like in practice**

In the case of our rebalancing strategy, we have:

* **The filter**: which removes stocks that don’t fit our criteria
* **The asset, indicator combo**: which tells us the weight of the asset in the portfolio
* **The sort and limit:** which tells us which metric we’re sorting our assets by, and how many of those assets will we actually use when rebalancing

During the optimization process, we’ll combine the indicators of two decent individuals together. The individuals are picked depending on their relative performance during a process called selection.

For example, we’ll take the filter for two decent individuals, and combine the parameters to create new offspring.

[Pic: Creating a strategy via the crossover mechanism. A parent with a 50 day SMA and a 200 day SMA can crossover to create an offspring with a 50 day SMA](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*o1smMGSPeGWb1a5LIv2WPg.png)

Then, we take the offspring, and we’ll randomly mutate it at some probability.

[Pic: We don’t always mutate our strategy, but when we do, we introduce random changes that may help or hurt its performance](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*aQ96xhh9V92JHyHGRi_uMQ.png)

We’ll then evaluate the offspring, line everybody up, and exterminate the strategies that didn’t meet the performance bar.

Sounds brutal? It’s just what happens in nature.

Over time, the population naturally evolves. The individuals will become closer and closer to the optimized version (objectively) based on their objective functions. And, thanks to the occasional random mutations, we’ll often find random changes to the strategies that ended up working extremely well.

Finally, because we’re not making crazy assumptions about how these strategies should evolve, the end result is a population of strategies that are strictly better than the original population.

And now, using the genetic algorithm, we’ve created a population of improved trading strategies. Let’s see what this looks like in the UI.

# Exploring the genetic optimization UI

As you can probably imagine, the genetic optimization algorithm isn’t something that will complete in a couple minutes.

Try a few hours.

[Pic: The optimization algorithm after an hour and 15 minutes. It ran 9 out of the 25 generations](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*NIAMK7-B0qYMDws_F9BXew.png)

On the UI, there is a lot going on. Some important elements include:

* The **optimization summary**, which tells us the initial starting parameters of the config.
* The **training performance history**, which is the performance of the training set across each generation. This is the set that is used to train the parameters.
* The **validation performance history**, which is the performance of the validation set across each generation. This set is not used in training, and tells us about how well our strategy generalized.
* The **optimization vectors**, which more accurately should just be called “Individuals” in the population. It includes the performance in the training set, the performance of the validation set, and the strategy itself.

When optimizing the portfolio, I noticed some things including:

* The **validation set** performance increased gradually before sharply decreasing. This might indicate that in the later generations, the strategy is starting to **overfit**. In the future, one way we could prevent this is by implementing **early-stopping**.

[Pic: The validation set performance across time includes a sharp decline after the 5th generation. When training AI models, this is often seen as an indicator of overfitting, and we often implement methods like “early stopping” to prevent this](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*hBApbz7NhejT9o3y5NL3fQ.png)

* Many individuals in the population seem to have the *exact same performance* as other individuals. This might indicate that our population size is too small, and that we are prematurely converging to a solution. Or perhaps there’s a bug preventing the strategy from exploring the full solution space.

[Pic: A common individual that I saw when exploring the population](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1264/1*vQwuhVeqXIq2JEffgyr8KQ.png)

Nevertheless, despite these issues, I decided to see the optimization through to the end. While doing so, I noticed some more things.

[Pic: The optimization after 2 hours and 15 minutes; we’re on generation 19](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*f_yWHntFJnAVHzx-vtw4SQ.png)

* The **training set** performance increases gradually thoughout the generations. The sortino ratio is approaching nearly 2, starting from a sortino ratio of -0.37. Similarly, the percent gain is almost 30%, starting from a gain of 1.27%.
* Additionally, the increase in the training set over time doesn’t seem to be slowing down.
* The **validation set** gradually improves again, but nowhere near where it was before its drastic drop. Two hours in, and the percent gain is currently 16%, while it was previously as high as 27%.

[Pic: The validation set fitness after the 2 hours and 15 minutes](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*OyGyw5F_OJ2BNUL3qK9Amg.png)

Finally, nearly 3 hours pass, and we’re left with this.

[Pic: The strategy finishes optimization after nearly 3 hours](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*e8NpNalTr_TU_g-3Is315g.png)

Some final observations include:

* The training set performance steadily increases until the very end
* The validation set performance DOES continue increasing until the end surprisingly
* The individuals in the population are extremely healthy, both in terms of the training fitness and the validation fitness

Now it’s time for the fun part – picking an individual from the population to be our successor.

# Going through all of our individuals

The genetic optimization process will generate an entire population of an individuals each with their own strengths and weaknesses.

In theory, each individual should be near optimal in terms of Sortino ratio and percent change. Some of these individuals will have some of the highest percent change possible during the backtest period, while the other individuals will have some of the highest Sortino ratios.

To describe this mathematically, we would say the individuals are “Pareto optimal” or form a “non-dominated set.” This means that for each individual, there is no other solution that improves on both objectives simultaneously — improving one objective (like percent change) would require sacrificing performance on the other objective (Sortino ratio). This creates a frontier of optimal trade-offs rather than a single best solution.

[Pic: This individual had an excellent performance both in the training set and the validation set](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*Vq8kvTWwYPCRqilJ4eIHaA.png)

I’m going to click “Open Optimization Vector” on one of the common solutions. This will run a quicktest of this individual’s strategies for the last year – from 04/01/2024 to 04/01/2025. This is the final test for our trading strategy – we can see if the rules generalize to unseen data or if it suffered from overfitting. This is a common issue when working with genetic algorithms

In this case, the training procedure seemed to be *very* highly effective, creating an out of sample backtest that significantly outperforms the market.

[Pic: The final backtest for this portfolio. We see that it outpeforms the market significantly](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*l8H__q4tVOtmCttriSUXvg.png)

Looking at our results more carefully, we can see just how effective this strategy is compared to the original backtest.

[Pic: The backtest results of the non-optimized portfolio](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*uLQuHeR_c0Uu2G3BsV1ilA.png)

In particular:

* The optimized portfolio has a **higher overall percent return** (21.1% vs 16.2%). This is the ultimate goal of trading for someone like me – to make more money at the end of the day
* **It** ***also*** **has a higher risk-adjusted returns**. The sharpe ratio is 1.01 vs 0.53 and the sortino ratio is 1.44 vs 0.54. This suggests that the trading rules that we generated worked exactly as planned, and generalized well
* At the same time, **the drawdown of the strategy is much less for the optimized portfolio**, being at 8.65% vs 23.6%. In fact, the final drawdown of the optimized portfolio is even lower than the broader market (standing at 10.04%)
* The portfolio made fewer total transactions, meaning less money was lost due to things like slippage.

Overall, this is quite literally the best case scenario that could’ve happened during the optimization process. Hooray!

Finally, we’re going to scroll down and click “Edit” applying our changes to our portfolio.

# The end result: our new and improved trading strategy

[Pic: The rules for our new optimized trading strategy](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*L7ZcQYCytALLrOrr6Vmscg.png)

Our final optimized result has the following rules:

&gt;Rebalance \[(AAPL Stock, 1), (MSFT Stock, 1), (GOOG Stock, 1), (AMZN Stock, 1), (TSLA Stock, 1), (META Stock, 1), (NVDA Stock, 1), (TSM Stock, 1), (TM Stock, 1), (UNH Stock, 1), (JPM Stock, 1), (V Stock, 1), (JNJ Stock, 1), (HD Stock, 1), (WMT Stock, 1), (PG Stock, 1), (BAC Stock, 1), (MA Stock, 1), (PFE Stock, 1), (DIS Stock, 1), (AVGO Stock, 1), (ACN Stock, 1), (ADBE Stock, 1), (CSCO Stock, 1), (NFLX Stock, 1)\] Filter by ( Price &lt; 50 Day SMA) and (14 Day RSI &gt; 30) and (14 Day RSI &lt; 50) and ( Price &gt; 20 Day Bollinger Band) Sort by 3.4672601817929944 Descending **when (# of Days Since the Last Accepted Buy Order &gt; 91.93088409528382) or (# of Days Since the Last Canceled Sell Order = -91.36896325977536)**

The bolded part is the part that changed the most from the original. Instead of rebalancing every 30 days, we instead choose to rebalance every 3 months. That change alone significantly improved the final output of our portfolio.

Surprisingly, we notice that the relative weights of the portfolio did not change during the optimization process at all. In my view, This is likely both a bug and a feature and we may want to consider how we might make sure we test out different weights too. However, this isn’t the worse, as the fewer changes like this we make, the less the chance we’ll have our optimization algorithm cherry-pick weights based on what happened in the past.

Finally, we’ll deploy our portfolio so we can see how the newly optimized portfolio does for real-time paper-trading.

# Concluding Thoughts

This article shows us how powerful these biologically-inspired algorithms can be for trading strategies. Starting with Claude’s already impressive mean-reverting strategy, we’ve managed to significantly enhance performance through multi-objective optimization — achieving higher returns, better risk-adjusted metrics, and lower drawdowns. The optimized strategy outperformed both the original strategy and the broader market on nearly every meaningful metric.

What’s particularly impressive is how genetic algorithms work differently from traditional AI approaches. Instead of incremental improvements through gradient descent, they explore a diverse population of potential solutions through crossover and mutation — just like natural selection. This approach lets us optimize for multiple objectives simultaneously without making oversimplified assumptions about financial markets. The result is a robust strategy that better handles market volatility and delivers superior risk-adjusted returns.

The most surprising insight was that our optimization process primarily improved the timing of trades rather than asset weights. By extending the rebalancing period from monthly to quarterly, the algorithm reduced transaction costs while better capturing longer-term mean-reverting patterns. This demonstrates that sometimes the most effective improvements come from unexpected places.

NYSE-listed shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) (TSM) dipped nearly 1% in Wednesday’s pre-market trading after a Financial Times report suggested the company’s recently announced $100 billion U.S. investment plan reflects an “intention” rather than a “promise.”

The report highlighted that while the pledge has temporarily eased political pressure, TSMC has yet to outline specifics on how and when the investment will be deployed, leaving investors uneasy.

It noted that TSMC’s latest pledge is significantly different from past commitments. When TSMC first pledged to build semiconductor fabrication plants (fabs) in Arizona during Trump’s first term, it provided detailed construction schedules.

The same applied when it expanded its U.S. investment to $40 billion in 2022 and then $65 billion in April 2024.

This time, the company has merely stated that it will add three new fabs to the three already announced, along with two facilities for advanced packaging. No precise timeline or breakdown of the $100 billion expenditure has been given.

The report also pointed out that despite the scale of the investment, TSMC’s U.S. operations will remain a fraction of its global business.

Analysts estimate that by the early 2030s, the Arizona fabs will generate no more than one-third of the company’s total revenue.",37,9,1743595635.0,2025-04-02T12:07:15+00:00,t3_1jpmxxb,stocks

I'm a new grad 24F just trying to invest in (mostly) index funds based on my own research, with very poor financial literacy to begin with.

1. What percent in the negatives is considered good to buy at when ""buying low"" (1 understand buying low comes with the risk of them not coming back up but l'm more comfortable with this option because I only have 600$ to put into stocks right now)
2. I'm looking to buy low and probably never sell and just let them grow and add smaller amounts weekly/monthly as my budget allows.
I don't necessarily want to watch to see when stocks are high to sell, If eel like l'd rather just keep buying when lower??? Idk man
3. If a fund is 153$ is one share = 153$. l'm so

In March of 2021 they came out with “*The 630× Decade: 10 Stocks for the Next Tech Revolution”.* In short, the report recommended stocks that they reasoned were uniquely positioned to take advantage of the self-driving car revolution. It was timed to coincide with a then-upcoming announcement from Tesla, in which they believed Tesla would finally unveil their full self-driving update. The potential gains, they said, reached as high as 630 times over the next decade. Of course, there was the requisite warning that there were no guarantees, and that probably not every stock would be a winner. Now, four years later, we’re not exactly at the midway point, but my personal opinion is that anywhere between four and six years is fair for a midterm review. So, here are the stocks, starting with the winners and moving downward to the losers. TLDNR version - any investor who bought and held is looking at a return of **83 cents on the dollar** today.

249,TSM,WSJ—Trump’s Economic Messaging is Spooking Some of His Own Advisers👀,"WSJ—President Trump’s stop-and-start trade policy and uneven economic messaging have rattled some of his own allies, triggering a flood of calls from business executives, concerns from Republican lawmakers and tension in the White House.

Senior officials, including White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, have received panicked calls from chief executives and lobbyists, who have urged the administration to calm jittery markets by outlining a more predictable tariff agenda, according to people familiar with the discussions. Many in the business community have abandoned efforts to get the president to reverse course on trade, instead pleading with the White House for clarity on his approach, the people said. 

In a meeting Monday in the White House’s Roosevelt Room, the president and his top advisers huddled with the chief executive officers of International Business Machines, Qualcomm, HP and other tech companies. Some of the CEOs voiced their concerns about Trump’s tariffs, warning that they could hurt their industry, according to a person who attended the meeting. Trump told reporters that attendees at the meeting talked about investing in the U.S.

The mixed messages from the president and his advisers have raised concerns among some Republicans that Trump lacks a cohesive economic plan. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week the economy needed a “detox.” Trump has acknowledged that the tariffs could result in economic pain for consumers and, in an interview Sunday, declined to rule out a recession, accelerating a selloff on Wall Street on Monday that wiped out all gains in major stock indexes since Election Day in November. On Tuesday, the president played down the possibility of a recession, but underscored his commitment to far-reaching tariffs. 

All the while, Trump and his team have made frequent adjustments to his trade policies, announcing last-minute exemptions and reversals.

“It has been a horrific start for the economic policy team,” said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former Congressional Budget Office director who now runs the conservative American Action Forum.

Trump’s aggressive approach to tariffs has unnerved some Trump administration economic officials, including staff on the National Economic Council, who are concerned that tariffs and uncertainty over trade policy are tanking the stock market and fueling price increases on everything from energy to construction materials, people familiar with the matter said. The president’s economic advisers have warned him that tariffs could hurt the market and economic growth, but he has largely been undeterred, the people said. 

The White House said Trump’s economic advisers aren’t divided. “Every member of the Trump administration is playing from the same playbook—President Trump’s playbook—to enact an America First agenda of tariffs, tax cuts, deregulation, and the unleashing of American energy,” White House spokesperson Kush Desai said. 

Desai confirmed that senior officials have taken calls from corporate leaders, adding that National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett has talked to nearly a dozen CEOs in the past two days.

The spate of tariff proclamations and the resulting economic convulsions have brought to the surface long-simmering tensions among members of Trump’s economic team.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, the hard-charging former chief executive at the financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald, is overseeing Trump’s expansive trade agenda and has regularly appeared on cable television to discuss the matter. He has at times not fully looped in some of the president’s other economic advisers, according to people familiar with the matter, including Hassett, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and officials at the Council of Economic Advisers.

In one instance last week, Lutnick went on Fox News and announced that Canada and Mexico could soon strike a deal with the U.S. to avoid some of the 25% tariffs Trump had imposed over fentanyl trafficking. That surprised Greer and CEA staff, leaving them rushing to come up with a solution, eventually persuading Trump to grant a one-month pause on tariffs for goods that comply with a U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, according to people familiar with the matter.

Bessent has made clear to members of Trump’s team that he wants to be a principal voice on economic policy across the administration, according to people familiar with the matter.

“Secretary Lutnick’s long and immensely successful private sector career makes him an integral addition to the Trump administration’s trade and economic team,” Desai said, pointing to manufacturing job gains and investment commitments from companies such as Apple   and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.  

On CBS News on Tuesday night, Lutnick defended the administration’s rollout of its trade policy, saying: “It is not chaotic, and the only one who thinks it’s chaotic is someone who’s being silly.”

Nearly two months into Trump’s presidency, his advisers say he is more determined than ever to carry out his far-reaching tariff agenda, despite increasing pressure to change course. 

In Trump’s first term, he watched the markets almost hourly, and even a temporary dip could lead to a change in policy, former senior administration officials said. This time, he is still interested in the markets, but is less inclined to abandon his tariff plans, though he has delayed the implementation of some duties, an administration official said. 

Trump’s first-term National Economic Council director, Gary Cohn, and others at times opposed the president’s tariff proposals. This time, most of Trump’s current advisers aren’t trying to dissuade him from invoking tariffs, officials said. Instead, they are advocating for more targeted tariffs with exemptions for key sectors. 

For example, Hassett and others successfully lobbied Trump to abandon his campaign pledge for an across-the-board tariff on all U.S. trading partners, and to opt instead for a reciprocal trade action that would allow room for other nations to negotiate lower tariffs with the U.S., according to people familiar with the discussions.

Trump’s reciprocal tariff move, which seeks to equalize U.S. tariffs with the duties and nontariff barriers charged by other nations, is set to be announced in April. But that initiative could take six months or more to implement fully, people familiar with the policy previously told The Wall Street Journal. 

The uncertainty over tariff policy is also frustrating some Trump allies on Capitol Hill, a growing number of whom are worried about the economic ramifications of tariffs.

“We don’t know what this is gonna look like tomorrow,” said Sen. Mike Rounds (R., S.D.), adding that he is “very frustrated” by the uncertainty that the tariff agenda is foisting on farmers and businesses in his state. 

Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina said the stop-and-start nature of the tariffs is contributing to stock market losses and difficulties in corporate planning. “Business hates uncertainty,” he said.

Sen. Bill Hagerty (R., Tenn.), a Trump confidant and a first-term ambassador to Japan, acknowledged that the markets are “trying to digest” the messages emanating from the White House on tariffs, but held out hope that certainty could be on the horizon.

“I think once we get these [tariff] announcements done and the market can actually sort out exactly what they mean, that will hopefully calm things,” he said.

Trump spoke Tuesday to the Business Roundtable, an influential group of corporate executives. A person familiar with the event’s planning said several executives changed their plans to attend.

“Swinging from one extreme to another is not the right policy approach,” Chevron CEO Mike Wirth told an energy conference in Houston on Monday. “We have allocated capital that’s out there for decades, and so we really need consistent and durable policy.”

TSM has proposed a joint venture to Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom to operate Intel's foundry division, with TSM managing the operations but holding less than a 50% stake. We saw INTC make a decent bounce in the overnight yesterday on that news, but it looks like we're giving back most of those gains. This move comes as Intel faces significant losses in its manufacturing division, the CHIPS Act is targeted by Trump, so frankly a very good positive catalyst but I don't expect much to come of this. The possibility of a joint venture between these 4 companies actually happening seems fantastical, especially with Trump stating that he wants to scrap the CHIPS Act and instead work on tariffs on semis.

Loop Capital has maintained a buy rating on Reddit Inc. (RDDT), citing strong core fundamentals and a 71% year-over-year sales growth. I don't normally pay attention to these buy/sell ratings but I did notice this was during one of the worst selloffs for RDDT and the market downturn, so it was *a little* more significant than normal.  The company's stock has experienced a nearly 50% decline from recent highs within the past month. I thought this was interesting yesterday near the open so I bought some stock, overall still holding but interested to see where it goes after the open. Also worth noting, Reddit's plans to monetize its subscriber base are expected to boost revenue (I see them competing with Patreon/Substack/Onlyfans). This is overall a pretty positive catalyst, not much risk to it beyond additional negative news coming in for the broader tech sector.

Google has unveiled Gemma 3, a new AI model designed for developers to create applications capable of running efficiently on various devices, including those powered by Nvidia GPUs. I'm also long NVDA a little more- GOOG hasn't pulled back as much as I expected compared to NVDA, but this is pointedly good news. We're also seeing a minor market bounce but whether that can hold is up in the air. Going to sell out if we break new lows in the market. Another model in the arms race that can be run on a SINGLE device is massive news, especially considering the model's competitiveness with Deepseek R1. This is overall positive news but there's always the chance that Deepseek releases an even better model in the future even though the $13M training costs have been debunked.

TSM has proposed a joint venture to Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom to operate Intel's foundry division, with TSM managing the operations but holding less than a 50% stake. We saw INTC make a decent bounce in the overnight yesterday on that news, but it looks like we're giving back most of those gains. This move comes as Intel faces significant losses in its manufacturing division, the CHIPS Act is targeted by Trump, so frankly a very good positive catalyst but I don't expect much to come of this. The possibility of a joint venture between these 4 companies actually happening seems fantastical, especially with Trump stating that he wants to scrap the CHIPS Act and instead work on tariffs on semis. 

[**RDDT (Reddit Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RDDT&amp;p=d)

Loop Capital has maintained a buy rating on Reddit Inc. (RDDT), citing strong core fundamentals and a 71% year-over-year sales growth. I don't normally pay attention to these buy/sell ratings but I did notice this was during one of the worst selloffs for RDDT and the market downturn, so it was *a little* more significant than normal.  The company's stock has experienced a nearly 50% decline from recent highs within the past month. I thought this was interesting yesterday near the open so I bought some stock, overall still holding but interested to see where it goes after the open. Also worth noting, Reddit's plans to monetize its subscriber base are expected to boost revenue (I see them competing with Patreon/Substack/Onlyfans). This is overall a pretty positive catalyst, not much risk to it beyond additional negative news coming in for the broader tech sector.

Google has unveiled Gemma 3, a new AI model designed for developers to create applications capable of running efficiently on various devices, including those powered by Nvidia GPUs. I'm also long NVDA a little more- GOOG hasn't pulled back as much as I expected compared to NVDA, but this is pointedly good news. We're also seeing a minor market bounce but whether that can hold is up in the air. Going to sell out if we break new lows in the market. Another model in the arms race that can be run on a SINGLE device is massive news, especially considering the model's competitiveness with Deepseek R1. This is overall positive news but there's always the chance that Deepseek releases an even better model in the future even though the $13M training costs have been debunked. 

**Sidenote:** Initiated a small short position in VXX after it broke above 60 (as mentioned yesterday); however, the primary focus remains on RDDT today.

49,TSM,"Thoughts on my portfolio focused on semiconductors, gold, and cloud retail?","
Hey everyone, I've been building a portfolio with a $500 daily investment strategy (except for SHOP at $1000 daily) and wanted to get some feedback on my thinking and potential blind spots.

My current investments:

**Semiconductor focus:**
- TSM (Taiwan Semiconductor)
- AMD (Advanced Micro Devices)

**Gold/Mining exposure:**
- GLD (SPDR Gold Shares ETF)
- RGLD (Royal Gold)
- NEM (Newmont Corporation)
- FNV (Franco Nevada)

**E-commerce:**
- SHOP (Shopify) - double investment at $1000 daily

**My reasoning:**

1. **Semiconductors (TSM, AMD)**: With AI development accelerating and computing demands increasing globally, semiconductor companies seem positioned for long-term growth. TSM provides manufacturing exposure as the world's largest foundry, while AMD gives me exposure to both CPU and GPU markets.

2. **Gold/Mining (GLD, RGLD, NEM, FNV)**: I'm allocating to gold as a hedge against economic uncertainty and inflation concerns. I've diversified within this sector with both direct gold exposure (GLD) and mining companies with different business models (traditional mining with NEM, royalty companies with RGLD and FNV).

3. **E-commerce (SHOP)**: I'm bullish on continued e-commerce growth, and Shopify seems to be winning the platform battle for small/medium businesses. I'm investing double here because I see strong growth potential.

What I'm considering:
- Is my portfolio too concentrated in semiconductors and gold?
- Should I add more geographic diversity?
- Am I missing any key sectors that would balance this approach?

Would appreciate any constructive feedback or thoughts on potential blind spots in my strategy. Thanks!",0,14,1741774492.0,2025-03-12T10:14:52+00:00,t3_1j9gro8,investing
16,TSM,"Those who panic sold yesterday or today are about to face the pain rally back up, at least in the short term, if not long term.","At minimum, a sharp short term rally upward will likely take place tomorrow and through the next few trading days.

The worst scenario for those who panic sold will be if they miss out on an entire market recovery. 

If the US does NOT fall into a recession, they will be forced to buy back into SP500 at ATH later this year, and have incurred permanent losses.

Here’s the extensive data:

EARNINGS ESTIMATES IMPLY BACK TO ATH IF RECESSION IS AVOIDED

The S&amp;P 500 is 10% off it's all-time high, yet price targets haven't budged and now imply index upside of 18% (93rd percentile rank). If fundamentals remain strong and keep price targets steady, this type of move has historically been good for forward returns.

MARKET PLUMBING IS CLEARED OUT

CTA flush is now over and according to Goldman CTA strategist Cullen Morgan, CTAs are now SHORT -$10bn of US equities after selling -$39bn in the last 5 sessions, and fully burning through their entire ~$200BN long as of mid-February. 

Morgan points out something everyone who has been trading in recent days know all too well: ""There have only been 15 other instances of similar/greater magnitude in our dataset. Outside of three bouts in 2023, they all occurred in 2018 and 2020."" Those who say today feels like the covid liquidations, you are not wrong.

CTAs are now done selling US stocks in pretty much any scenario.

THE MARKET BEAR NARRATIVE IS NOW INCONSISTENT WITH DXY, RATES, INFLATION DATA AND AI TRADE FUNDAMENTALS

Oil down.
Rates down.
Truflation at lowest level in 4 years.
Dollar down.
Credit spreads stable.
All in reference to the last few weeks btw.

Note that every company that guided in late January/early February incorporated a strong dollar into their guidance.  Weak dollar really good for large, global American companies.

GPU spot retail availability is down post Deepseek.
GPU spot rental pricing up post Deepseek.  
Google raising contract GPU rental pricing.
DRAM spot prices go up every day.  
China buying every GPU they can post Deepseek.  
TSM February growth accelerated YoY vs. January.
GTC next week.

Massive degrossing in the long leg of the momentum factor; by some measures the sharpest down move ever in this period of time.

Nasdaq down roughly the same magnitude/velocity as the Covid crash.

FII institute speech was less than 20 days ago.  Trump opened his speech focusing on how much the equity markets were up since his election.  I think he still cares despite all the rhetoric to the contrary.  “No crying in the casino,” etc.

I think there is a little too much confidence that the administration *wants* a recession.  They are most focused on the deficit and a recession would obviously be negative for the deficit.

SENTIMENT FAVORS SNAPBACK

251,TSM,Tech megacaps lose over $750 billion in market cap in worst day for Nasdaq since 2022,"It’s gone from bad to worse for tech investors.

With the Nasdaq suffering its steepest drop since 2022 on Monday, the seven most valuable tech companies lost more than $750 billion in market value. Recession fears and concerns about a trade war drove the selloff.

Apple led the megacap losses, with its value plummeting by about $174 billion. Nvidia shaved off almost $140 billion in market value and shares closed down 5%. The leading AI chipmaker has lost nearly a third of its value just two months after notching a fresh high in January.

Tesla had the biggest percentage loss, with shares of the electric vehicle maker tumbling 15%, their worst day since 2020. The company has lost more than half its value since its stock price peaked in mid-December**.** The stock is also coming off its longest weekly losing streak in history as a public company.

Tesla lost $130 billion in value on Monday, while Microsoft and Alphabet lost $98 billion and $95 billion, respectively. Amazon lost $50 billion and Meta lost $70 billion.

Alphabet and Meta dropped more than 4% on Monday, while Microsoft and Amazon dropped at least 2% each. The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund fell more than 4%, entering correction territory. Shares are more than 14% off their high.

Heavy selling intensified across the tech, with the Nasdaq falling to a six-month low. Many tech companies rely on parts and manufacturing overseas and new levies could push up prices. That’s also sparked worries of a U.S. recession, which Trump didn’t rule out over the weekend.

Semiconductor makers have also felt the pain, with the sector a primary target of new tariffs. Last week, the president announced an additional $100 billion investment from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and called the company the “most powerful” in the world as he looks to boost domestic production.

The VanEck Semiconductor ETF has plunged 3% over the past week and is down more than 16% since the inauguration. Heavy selling rattled the sector again Monday, with the ETF last down roughly 5%. Marvell Technology shed 8%, while ASML Holding and Micron Technology slumped more than 6% each. Broadcom fell 5%.

25,TSM,Trump Calls for End to $52 Billion Chips Act Subsidy Program,"&gt;President Donald Trump called for ending a bipartisan $52 billion semiconductor subsidy program that’s spurred more than $400 billion in investments from companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Intel Corp.

&gt;“Your Chips Act is a horrible, horrible thing,” the president said in a prime-time address to Congress on Tuesday. Trump implored US House Speaker Mike Johnson to get rid of the legislation and use “whatever is left over” to “reduce debt or any other reason.”

&gt;His remarks were met with applause in a chamber that passed the Chips and Science Act less than three years ago. Vice President JD Vance, whose home state of Ohio won a massive Intel project thanks to the law, stood up to show his support for its revocation.

&gt;The Chips Act is among the most significant US forays into industrial policy in more than a generation. It set aside $39 billion in grants — plus loans and 25% tax breaks — to revitalize American semiconductor manufacturing, as well as $11 billion for chip research and development. The aim was to reduce reliance on Asia for electronic components that power everything from smartphones to massive data centers.

&gt;Trump, however, has consistently derided a program he regards as a waste of government funds, arguing tariffs would achieve the same outcome while filling coffers. Republicans have also indicated that they want to repeal what they see as “social” provisions of the Chips Act. That could involve eliminating labor-friendly regulations or environmental requirements.

&gt;Officials on both sides of the aisle have touted the Chips Act as crucial to US national and economic security, and Trump could have a hard time getting congressional support to repeal it. Dozens of GOP lawmakers voted for the measure, and many red districts have won factories or other projects supported by the law.

&gt;That includes South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co. and SK Hynix Inc., which have committed to multibillion-dollar projects in Texas and Indiana that were contingent on funding and support from the US government. Company representatives declined to comment on the president’s remarks.

&gt;Trump, favoring tariffs over incentives, has signaled that import levies on chips could come as soon as next month. Companies can avoid those duties, he has said, by building factories on American soil. He has not offered additional details.

&gt;On Monday, Trump credited the tariff threats for TSMC’s decision to invest $100 billion in the US, on top of a previous $65 billion commitment. He touted that project in his address Tuesday, referencing the full $165 billion figure. “We’re giving them no money,” Trump said. “All that was important to them was they didn’t want to pay the tariffs.”

&gt;A TSMC spokesperson declined to comment.

&gt;The company originally announced plans for a $12 billion US site during Trump’s first term and expanded that project to three factories under Biden. To support those facilities, TSMC struck an agreement with Biden officials for $6.6 billion in Chips Act grants and $5 billion in loans.

&gt;As is the case for other Chips Act awards, the funding is supposed to be disbursed over time, as TSMC hits negotiated project milestones. The company received $1.5 billion before Biden left office.

&gt;Trump did not specify whether he would attempt to claw back money that’s already been disbursed, renege on remaining incentives to which the government has already committed, or simply not provide additional support for the chipmaker’s latest investment. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Monday that the newly announced projects — three additional chip plants, plus R&amp;D and advanced packaging sites — won’t win federal funds.

&gt;“The main uncertainty is the future of TSMC,” said Xin-Yao Ng, an investment director at abrdn plc. “One long-time competitive advantage was their clustering in Taiwan, where labor costs are still reasonable, construction costs are cheaper, government is supportive, and they can find more workers with vocational training. It’s completely different in the US if they are to shift more manufacturing. Subsidies from US were to be crucial to help mitigate some of the higher costs and challenges.”

&gt;TSMC is among 20 companies that reached binding Chips Act agreements with Biden officials. The deals, which represent more than 85% of the manufacturing incentives available under the program, are designed to support leading-edge facilities by companies like TSMC, Intel, Samsung and Micron Technology Inc. — as well as older-generation factories by the likes of GlobalFoundries Inc. and Texas Instruments Inc.

&gt;Companies have generally viewed those agreements as ironclad — regardless of who’s in office. But some of them have worried that the Trump administration could seek to modify the terms, Bloomberg has reported. Lutnick has said he cannot commit to honoring existing contracts without reviewing them first.

&gt;That review is ongoing, and Lutnick’s intentions for the initiative remain unclear. So far, his questions to program staff have focused on the rationale behind award decisions and the government’s legal authority to claw money back, Bloomberg has reported. The current Chips Act team, meanwhile, has been preparing a list of potential adjustments to the funding application process and final contracts that would be minimally disruptive.

&gt;A spokesperson for GlobalWafers Co., which won $406 million from the Chips Act for factories in Texas and Missouri, said the Taiwanese company is committed to its expansion strategy and views any changes to the Chips Act as “unlikely.”

&gt;But if the law were to be modified in some way, the spokesperson said, “we would reassess future investments, including evaluating US market demand, pricing, and potential tariffs if production were moved outside the US.”

**My take:** Brutally bad for semiconductor sector if CHIPS is actually repealed, INTC is especially targeted. There'd be less semiconductor manufacturing in the US (INTC/TSM/Samsung) primarily because we subsidize and have tax incentives for current US chip manfacturing projects, and companies that haven't received their funding will likely scale back projects [(remember INTC delayed their Ohio plant to 2028?)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j0cq51/intel_delays_28_billion_ohio_chip_factory_in_new/). The US would also be far more dependent on semiconductor production overseas. 

This also has spillover into the quantum computing stocks (IONQ/RGTI) and AI sector due to the sectors being so reliant on technological development and supply from the semis sectors.

Overall don't think new tariffs are going to be an adequate replacement for what the US has committed so far (but we don't know much about  the tariffs yet), and the markets hate uncertainty.

252,TSM,"Trump, Chip Maker TSMC Expected to Announce $100 Billion Investment in U.S.","WASHINGTON—Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. 2330 -1.92%decrease; red down pointing triangle intends to invest $100 billion in chip-manufacturing plants in the U.S. over the next four years under a plan expected to be announced later Monday by President Trump, according to people familiar with the matter.

The investment would be used to build out cutting-edge chip-making facilities. Such an expansion would advance a long-pursued U.S. goal to regrow the domestic semiconductor industry after manufacturing fled largely to Asian countries in recent decades.

TSMC, the world’s largest contract chip-maker, set down roots in Arizona in 2020, when it said it would build a chip factory there for $12 billion. Its ambitions for the site have expanded rapidly since, with two more factories on the same site and a total investment of $65 billion. The company’s first factory began mass production late last year.

TSMC’s announcement comes after years of deliberation regarding the future of semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S. and the global tech sector. The company currently builds its most advanced chip-making facilities only on its home soil Taiwan. The chips it produces are critical for powering everything from the latest artificial-intelligence systems to smartphones.

Since the Biden administration, the U.S. has expressed concerns about TSMC’s near-monopoly on advanced chip manufacturing and has been urging the company to relocate more of its cutting-edge production, including advanced chip-packaging facilities, to the U.S. Advanced chip packaging is particularly critical for AI-related chips, as it enhances performance by integrating multiple semiconductor components, reducing size, improving power efficiency, and ensuring faster data transfer—key factors for AI applications.

[awarded up to $6.6 billion of grants](https://www.wsj.com/tech/taiwanese-chip-making-giant-tsmc-gets-6-6-billion-for-arizona-project-f75e9de4?mod=article_inline), and has recently begun to receive federal money from the program. Generous tax credits have also boosted chip-making projects in the U.S.

“We’re pleased to have an opportunity to meet with the President and look forward to discussing our shared vision for innovation and growth in the semiconductor industry, as well as exploring ways to bolster the technology sector along with our customers,” TSMC said in a statement.

U.S. officials see chip-making as a national-security imperative because economies, technological advancement and military might all are increasingly dependent on who has the best chips. Covid-era supply-chain issues also highlighted the critical nature of the industry when shortages of chips led to slowdowns in auto sales, among other disruptions.

Trump has repeatedly called for more chip manufacturing in the U. S.—although he criticized the Chips Act on the campaign trail and argued the better way to attract manufacturing was through tariffs. Last month, he said he was considering a 25% or more tariff on semiconductor imports.

“We have to have chips made in this country. Right now, everything is made in Taiwan, practically, almost all of it, a little bit in South Korea, but everything—almost all of it is made in Taiwan. And we want it to be made—we want those companies to come to our country, in all due respect,” Trump said in February.

Since taking office, Trump has appeared at the White House with the chief executives of several companies to announce pledges to invest in the U.S. The details of the projects are often vague and it is often unclear whether the pledges represent [new investments by the companies](https://www.wsj.com/tech/apple-corporate-new-job-investment-what-to-expect-ad19993c?mod=article_inline).

26,TSM,Will US-Ukraine Split will trigger Chinese invasion of Taiwan (TSM/NVDA related),"There's at least two possibilities: 

* Our divestment from Ukraine will give us more resources to deal with China militarily; or
* We're actually signaling to China that we are not interested in defending other countries.

Chinese invasion of Taiwan is always on the table, but some people think what happened on Friday at the White House has just raised that possibility dramatically.

For example, Cramer wrote an article over the weekend for his paid community where he said: 

* ""If I was Chinese President Xi Jinping, I would immediately move militarily on Taiwan, betting that President Trump may switch sides and back China.""

* ""If you disagree with that after Friday’s White House exchange with Zelenskyy, you need to soul search your position. To me, this could be a tremendous opportunity for the PRC to stop this whole game of export restrictions from the U.S. and just turn everything on its head by taking over the island and, along with it, the most important strategic asset in the world right now, Taiwan Semi.""

* ""In a world where Zelenskyy gets thrown under the bus for lack of gratitude and starting a war that he didn’t start, how can we defend an allegedly ungrateful Taiwan? Perhaps because, unlike Ukraine, there is something at stake economically?""

* ""Will President Trump’s advisers discuss the notion that if we care about keeping the Chinese from getting the latest and greatest Nvidia chips, we should care about Taiwan’s sovereignty? Will Trump be persuaded by even cowed generals and naïve national security advisers that Nvidia and Taiwan Semi are of strategic importance? Do they even know that?""

Of course Cramer is an entertainer and not a military strategist. But I'm curious what does the community think.

84,TSM,A closer look at Microsoft news – buy the AI dip?,"As is usual before NVDA earnings, FUD is being spread about the ‘AI trade.’ I find this situation again reminiscent of the DeepSeek panic which NVDA and other AI plays quickly rebounded from in about a week (see my previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1icdu1d/deepseek_training_cost_the_95_mil_difference/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) highlighting the blatant misunderstanding of renting GPUs for $5.6m vs. total cost of ownership for AI infrastructure in $100s of billions).

**The FUD: ‘data center oversupply’**

Headlines have been coming out that Microsoft walking away from a “couple hundred MWs” of datacenter leases (note, this would likely represent &lt;5% of their overall estimated 5 GW installed capacity). Analysts are also insinuating this means there is a larger ‘oversupply’ and therefore AI capital expenditures will be slowing down.

[The Register - Microsoft's drawback on datacenter investment may signal AI demand concerns](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=newssearch&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj8jtzHg9-LAxXol-4BHfCRJ4cQxfQBKAB6BAgPEAE&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theregister.com%2F2025%2F02%2F24%2Fdoes_microsoft_pull_back_on%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw3nXfbntonLATxN5KnPWAzG&amp;opi=89978449)

*“TD Investment bank claims software giant ditched 'at least' 5 land parcels due to potential 'oversupply'”*

 

**The Critique: Dip Buying Opp?**

First off, it is not clear if these MSFT leases are for high-performance compute (GPUs for AI workloads) or traditional non-AI cloud (for things like storage, where demand has been waning). For the sake of argument, let’s assume this was for AI compute.

**Point 1** \- Overall, Microsoft is not slowing down. After the TD report on Friday, Microsoft [reiterated they are not cutting their $80bil capital spending plan for this year](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/24/microsoft-reiterates-plan-to-invest-80-billion-in-ai-.html). So, as they are walking away from a couple hundred MWs of leased capacity, meanwhile they will be building several GWs.

**Point 2** \- In Q4, Microsoft missed cloud revenue targets. On the earnings call, CFO Amy hood noted shortfalls in Q4 performance was due to supply constraints, and the larger capex spend is expected to drive stronger Azure growth. In other words, the revenue miss was a *capacity problem*, not a *demand problem*. So why slow down now? Doesn’t add up.

**Point 3** – Open AI is adding more compute capacity with other partners (Oracle and Softbank). This would represent a ***shift*** in capital spending from Microsoft to others, i.e. this does not indicate an oversupply.

[Microsoft and OpenAI evolve partnership to drive the next phase of AI - The Official Microsoft Blog](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/01/21/microsoft-and-openai-evolve-partnership-to-drive-the-next-phase-of-ai/)

“Microsoft has **approved OpenAI’s ability to build additional capacity**, primarily for research and training of models.”

[OpenAI Stargate Joint Venture Demystified | Microsoft Sore Loser, Does Softbank Have The Capital?, Texas GigaCampus, Winners &amp; Losers – SemiAnalysis](https://semianalysis.com/2025/01/23/openai-stargate-joint-venture-demystified/#microsoft-is-the-biggest-loser)

“**Microsoft is largely left on the sidelines as OpenAI utilizes another infrastructure partner.** As Satya Nadella [stated](https://x.com/ns123abc/status/1882085592135237737?s=19), “all I know is, I’m good for my $80B.” Microsoft’s recent [blog post](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/01/21/microsoft-and-openai-evolve-partnership-to-drive-the-next-phase-of-ai/) stated the facts of the partnership and how Microsoft has a ROFR, but the reality is this is incrementally negative for Microsoft long-term since they were **afraid to take on the risk of this investment.** “

“**Microsoft is shifting some of the capital intensity of its AI initiatives on to Oracle**, but we don’t think this short-term benefit outweighs the long-run potential harm of losing the revenue and control over OpenAI.”

**AI continues advancements:**

Anthropic’s [Claude 3.7](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/anthropics-claude-3-7-sonnet-the-first-hybrid-reasoning-model-is-now-available-in-amazon-bedrock/) was released Monday and is quickly approaching professional human-level coding abilities (70% on SWE bench, which measures agentic coding ability vs. 80% avg. score for a human professional). Open AI’s ChatGPT 4.5 is rumored to be released in the coming weeks as well. These are/will be tangible results in the advancement of these models towards agentic use with addressable markets in the trillions (think remote ‘drop-in’ AI coworker). Further, continued investment in U.S. AI infrastructure will be of paramount importance to national security (maintaining AI supremacy over China).  

**TLDR:** I see this as a dip buying opportunity on AI names &amp; energy. Overreaction from MSFT news. (NVDA, TSM, VRT\*\*, AVGO, MRVL, ANET, CIEN, NBIS, APLD, VST, OKLO, ET, KMI)

The Wall Street Journal reported that Broadcom may consider a play for the company’s chip design and marketing segment, citing people familiar with the matter, while TSMC is interested in a stake or complete control of Intel’s factories. The companies have not filed bids and talks are largely informal, the Journal reported.

The iconic American chipmaker’s stock has continued to sink lower in recent years, shedding billions in market value. Intel fell behind on the artificial intelligence tailwinds that have swept up the broader semiconductor sector.

5,TSM,Can Broadcom save Intel? What to know about the latest deal rumors,"Intel Corp.’s future has been a hot topic on Wall Street lately, and it’s poised to stay that way into another week following a new report about possible deal activity.  
  
This time, it’s from The Wall Street Journal, which said that Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (TSM) are looking separately at deals for different parts of Intel’s empire.

Intel and TSMC declined to comment. Broadcom didn’t immediately return MarketWatch’s request for comment.

Shares of Intel are up 5% in Tuesday’s premarket trading.

While there had already been speculation that TSMC was considering a move that would see it get more involved in Intel’s fabrication business, the new component in the reporting is the idea that Broadcom may be interested in Intel’s chip-design and marketing businesses.

Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon is intrigued. “We want Broadcom to stay away from the fabs, but would love to see what they could do with the products,” he wrote in a Monday note to clients. Broadcom would likely be able to execute Intel’s x86 central-processing-unit business better than what Intel has been showing recently, he noted.

Broadcom has a history of cutting costs and boosting prices after making acquisitions, Raymond James analyst Srini Pajjuri said in a report.

253,TSM,"Trump's Move for Moving Manufacturing into US, is Strategically good for Automation Revolution.","Start by saying, I'm not a Trumper.

Looking ahead 5–10 years, a strategic shift toward advanced, automated manufacturing in the U.S. could yield significant economic benefits. In this scenario, factories would increasingly rely on AI and robotics for design, management, and optimization—enabling tremendous output while reducing dependence on traditional, labor-intensive processes. As a result, the most valuable roles will likely focus on overseeing these sophisticated systems rather than on manual labor.

This evolution in manufacturing is expected to boost demand for companies that supply the necessary infrastructure and equipment—often dubbed “shovel makers.” Firms such as Johnson Controls International (JCI), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), ASML Holding, and Micron Technology (MU) are well positioned to benefit. Additionally, as automated production scales up, there could be a secondary surge in demand for embedded systems, potentially benefiting companies like AMD and Intel.

While this outlook remains speculative, current trends in automation, robotics, and AI suggest that a U.S.-focused, high-tech manufacturing base could provide a strong competitive advantage in the global economy by 2025 and beyond.

This is my Thesis why I think Nationalism is a great priority to have now, because the countries with this infrastructure will win, just like the US won after World War II.

250,TSM,Broadcom and TSMC in Talks to Carve Up Intel’s Declining Realm,"According to a recent report from The Wall Street Journal, industry giants Broadcom $AVGO and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) are reportedly in talks to carve up Intel’s declining realm.

Intel, once the indomitable titan of the chip-making world, has been struggling to maintain its dominance and is now considering a major division. Broadcom is eyeing Intel’s chip design and marketing division, while TSMC is poised to take over Intel’s manufacturing arm. This potential dismantling could align Intel with the growing industry trend where companies focus on either designing or manufacturing chips, but not both.

It’s incredible to think that a company as big and important as Intel, a name synonymous with innovation and technological advancement, is now facing such a drastic fate. One day, it was the undisputed leader in the semiconductor industry, and the next day, it looks like it might be divided and taken over. The market tilt is indeed ruthless.

The discussions are still in the early stages, and no formal offers have been made yet. However, Intel’s recent tribulations, including falling behind TSMC in advanced chip production and the abrupt departure of CEO Pat Gelsinger, have left it in a vulnerable position.

It's fascinating to witness how the landscape of the semiconductor industry might shift if this deal goes through. What do you all think about this potential carve-up? Do you believe it will spell the end of an era for Intel, or could this be the rebirth it desperately needs?",68,40,1739779615.0,2025-02-17T08:06:55+00:00,t3_1irey65,StockMarket
29,TSM,"TSMC, Broadcom consider possible Intel deals to split chipmaker","Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) rivals Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) are considering deals that could split the troubled U.S. chipmaker into two, the Wall Street Journal reported Saturday, citing people familiar with the matter.

Broadcom (AVGO) has been closely examining Intel's (INTC) chip design and marketing business, the report said, but will only make a bid if it can find a partner for Intel's (INTC) manufacturing business.

TSMC (TSM), the world's biggest contract chipmaker, has studied running all of Intel's (INTC) chip plants, either as part of an investor consortium or other structure, the report said.

The discussions with possible suitors and Trump administration officials, who are concerned about the company seen as crucial to national security, are being led by Intel's (INTC) executive chairman Frank Yeary, the report said.

According to the report, Yeary has been telling people close to him that he is focused on maximizing value for Intel (INTC) shareholders.

President Donald Trump's administration may not support Intel's (INTC) chip plants being run by a foreign player, Reuters reported Friday. While the White House supports foreign companies investing in the U.S., it is ""unlikely"" to support a foreign entity controlling Intel's (INTC) plants.

Bloomberg had earlier reported that TSMC (TSM) was evaluating acquiring a controlling stake in Intel's (INTC) factories at Trump's request.

Any deal for Intel (INTC) would require a signoff from the U.S. government, which has poured billions of dollars into Intel (INTC) under the Chips Act of 2022. The ailing chipmaker has been the largest beneficiary of the $53 billion program, receiving up to $7.9 billion to build new factories in Ohio, Arizona and other locations in the U.S.

Intel (INTC) set up its foundry business under the leadership of former CEO Pat Gelsinger, who embarked on an ambitious turnaround plan. But Gelsinger was forced out of the company last year after the board reportedly lost confidence in him.

Intel (INTC), currently valued at $102.19 billion, has tumbled nearly 65% in the last five years. In comparison, TSMC's (TSM) current market capitalization stands at $840.25 billion and Broadcom's (AVGO) at $1.09 trillion.",81,35,1739724337.0,2025-02-16T16:45:37+00:00,t3_1iqwcg5,stocks
51,TSM,Looking for Feedback on My 20–25 Year Leveraged &amp; Low-Volatility ETF Strategy (Europe),"Hello everyone! I’m a European investor with a total lumpsum of 200k, aiming at a 20–25+ year horizon.

My current plan:

1. Lumpsum: Invest all 200k right away.
2. Initial Split:
   * 120k (60%) in 2× Leveraged ETFs (Nasdaq + MSCI USA) (\~80k CL2 + \~40k LQQ)
   * 80k (40%) in Min Volatility ETFs (iShares Edge S&amp;P 500 Minimum Volatility UCITS ETF (\~40k SMPV) + iShares Edge MSCI World Minimum Volatility UCITS ETF (\~40k MVOL))
3. Satellite Stocks (10k total): 5k TSM + 5k ASML (included within the 200k).
4. Monthly Transition (\~8 Years): Add 1,800/month to the leveraged portion—of which 1,000 comes from selling the Min Vol ETFs, and 800 is fresh capital from outside.
5. Goal: After \~80 months (6–7 years), the original 80k in Min Vol should be fully transferred into leveraged. At that point, I’ll have (nearly) 100% in leveraged (plus the satellite stocks).

After this 8-year phase, I plan to continue contributing about 1,000/month (or revisit allocations if the strategy evolves). Eventually—maybe around year 15—I might scale down the leverage (e.g., shifting back to Min Vol or standard equity ETFs) to reduce volatility and preserve gains.

I’d love your insights on whether this approach is sensible or too risky, as well as any tips on execution and risk management.

Step-by-Step Overview

1. Immediate Lumpsum (200k) Leveraged ETFs (120k) Amundi Nasdaq-100 Daily (2x) Leveraged UCITS ETF Amundi Leveraged MSCI USA Daily (2x) UCITS ETF (Exact split: 40% Nasdaq-100 2x / 60% MSCI USA 2x = 48k / 72k)Min Volatility ETFs (80k) iShares Edge S&amp;P 500 Minimum Volatility UCITS ETF (SMPV) iShares Edge MSCI World Minimum Volatility UCITS ETF (MVOL) (Likely 50/50 split, 40k each, but open to adjusting.)Satellite Stocks (10k) 5k TSM + 5k ASML A small tilt to semiconductors/AI. This also slightly reduces how much goes into the ETFs.
2. Monthly Shift (Over \~80 Months) 1,800/month goes into the Leveraged ETFs 1,000: Sold from the Min Vol funds every month. 800: Fresh capital from outside the portfolio.Why 80 Months? 1,000 × 80 = 80k, which depletes the original Min Vol portion by about year 7 (plus or minus market fluctuations). At that point, I’ll be almost fully in leveraged ETFs (plus TSM &amp; ASML).
3. After 8 Years No more Min Vol left (in theory), so the portfolio is mostly leveraged. I plan to keep contributing around 1,000/month in fresh capital, or revisit the plan. If markets have big drawdowns along the way, I might see it as an opportunity to buy more leveraged at lower prices—though that’s speculative.
4. Reducing Leverage Closer to Horizon Around year 15 (or if I feel I’ve reached significant gains), I might sell part of the leveraged ETFs to buy new Min Vol (or standard broad-market) funds, slowly phasing out 2x exposure to lower volatility/“sequence risk” as I near retirement or other financial goals.

Rationale &amp; Considerations

1. Lumpsum vs. DCA I’m going all-in with 200k upfront for immediate market exposure. Historically, lumpsum tends to outperform purely waiting or DCA, though it’s more nerve-racking if a crash happens soon after investing.
2. Gradual Leverage Increase By selling 1k/month from Min Vol, I “average into” the leveraged ETFs. If a downturn hits early, I’ll be moving more capital into leveraged funds at (potentially) lower prices.
3. Volatility Drag Daily-reset 2x ETFs can suffer from sideways/choppy markets. Over \~15–20 years, I’m banking on sustained U.S. equity growth (especially tech), but I accept deeper drawdowns along the way.
4. Satellite Stocks TSM &amp; ASML give a direct play on semiconductors. They’re about 5% of the portfolio, so I’m mindful of overlap (ASML is also in the Nasdaq 100).
5. Long-Term Goal (\~20–25+ Years) Eventually, I don’t want to stay 100% leveraged right up to the end. I’m open to stepping down leverage gradually once I’m within 5–10 years of the final target date.

Questions for the Community

1. Is it too risky to aim for nearly 100% leveraged exposure by year 8, then keep it for another 12–17+ years before scaling down?
2. Min Vol Strategy: Is it worthwhile only for the first 7–8 years, or should I maintain some permanent min-vol exposure instead of fully transitioning?
3. Execution &amp; Costs: Selling 1k of min-vol monthly—any tips for managing transaction fees/taxes? Threshold-based or quarterly trades might reduce costs, but I'd lose the strict monthly approach.
4. Rebalancing: If the leveraged portion grows faster than planned, I might exceed 60/40 well before I finish transferring the min-vol. Should I rebalance more actively, or stick to the monthly shift?
5. Future Leverage Reduction: Advice on timing or criteria for reducing from 2x to standard ETFs? Should I do it in increments or all at once once the time arrives?

Final Thoughts  
My overall goal is to get invested immediately with a 60/40 lumpsum, then gradually shift that 40% min-vol into (1.7-2×) leveraged U.S. equity over about 8 years—funded partly by selling 1k/month of min-vol, plus 800/month fresh capital. By year 8, I’d be nearly fully leveraged, and I’ll ride that out until \~year 15 or so, at which point I might gradually de-risk.

I’m aware it’s a fairly aggressive (maybe too aggressive) plan. I’d love any feedback on potential pitfalls, alternative approaches, or personal experiences—especially if you’ve used daily-reset leveraged ETFs over a long timeframe.

6,TSM,Intel has become a political pawn — but it may not need Trump or a deal with TSMC,"&gt;A rumored joint venture between Intel Corp. and its biggest rival, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. could pose more potential problems than it’s worth, and the U.S. chip giant could actually fare fine without it, Bernstein Research concluded.

&gt;Intel’s stock has risen almost 30% this week alone but was falling Friday morning after those big gains. An hour after trading began, shares were down nearly 5% on the day.

&gt;Bernstein’s Stacy Rasgon attributed most of the stock’s rise this week to a report in Asia of some sort of joint venture with TSMC “to help prop \[Intel\] up” and to the Trump administration’s efforts to bolster a “Made in America” semiconductor agenda, after Vice President J.D. Vance’s comments in Paris this week.

&gt;But a joint venture with TSMC, now the worldwide chip-manufacturing leader, is not necessarily a great idea — and Rasgon pointed to some qualms.

&gt;Digitimes in Asia reported on ways a joint venture between the two chip giants could be formed, and Rasgon summed them up: (1.) having TSMC build a U.S. packaging plant, (2.) a JV in which TSMC would invest in Intel’s manufacturing operations and (3.) TSMC allowing Intel to handle its packaging orders from TSMC’s U.S. customers. Packaging technology refers to the protective casing of chips.

&gt;Rasgon voiced problems with all the options reportedly under discussion, stating in a note that Intel’s forming a joint venture with TSMC, which would also include a technology transfer from TSMC to Intel, does not make sense.

&gt;“We don’t know why TSMC would want to license their process tech and IP (voluntarily at least) to a potential leading edge competitor, unless the terms are very favorable,” Rasgon said in the client note, going on to wonder how much would Intel have to pay. “And frankly, if 18A and the overall process roadmap are as healthy as Intel claims, why do they even need to think about standardizing on TSMC’s process offerings?”

254,TSM,TSMC Considers Running Intel’s US Factories After Trump Team Request,"&gt;Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is considering taking a controlling stake in Intel Corp.’s factories at the request of Trump administration officials, a person familiar with the matter said, as the president looks to boost American manufacturing and maintain US leadership in critical technologies.

&gt;

&gt;Trump’s team raised the idea of a deal between the two companies in recent meetings with officials from the Taiwanese chipmaker, the person said, and TSMC was receptive. It’s unclear whether Intel is open to a transaction.

&gt;

&gt;The talks are in very early stages, and the exact structure of a potential partnership hasn’t been established. But the intended result would have the world’s largest made-to-order chipmaker fully operating Intel’s US semiconductor factories, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the conversations are private. It also would address concerns about Intel’s deteriorating financial state, which has forced the company to slash jobs and curb its global expansion plans.

&gt;

&gt;The arrangement may involve having major American chip designers take equity stakes, according to the person, along with support from the US government. That means the venture wouldn’t solely be owned by a foreign company. TSMC is the go-to chipmaker for Apple Inc., Nvidia Corp. and other companies developing semiconductors that power AI algorithms.

&gt;

&gt;TSMC and Santa Clara, California-based Intel declined to comment. A White House representative didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

&gt;

&gt;Intel shares pared losses on Friday after Bloomberg reported on the discussions. The stock was down less than 1% to $24 as 1:56 p.m. in New York after dropping as much as 5.3% earlier in the session.

&gt;

&gt;While Intel has lost a lot of ground to rivals over the last five years, it still manufactures the most widely used components in the personal computer and server industries. And it has the largest and most advanced production network owned by a US-based company. Those factories have taken on vital strategic importance as Washington works to reverse decades of semiconductor manufacturing shifting to Asia.

&gt;

&gt;Under former Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger, Intel embarked on an ambitious and expensive plan to restore its chipmaking lead, and the company won $7.9 billion in US government funding to support projects in four states. It’s also secured $3 billion to produce chips for the US military, all of which will be paid out over time as Intel’s plants hit key milestones. The company has received $2.2 billion as of January.

&gt;

&gt;But that effort has so far failed to attract enough outside customers to make the investments worthwhile, particularly at a new site in Ohio. Intel’s own products also are losing market share, adding to the overall squeeze on its finances — just when it needs to spend heavily. Gelsinger was forced out in December after the board lost confidence in his turnaround plans.

&gt;

&gt;Though Intel has reiterated its commitment to investing in US factories — even as it pulls back from efforts abroad — Washington officials have for months been discussing contingency plans. One option favored by some in the Biden administration was a possible deal between Intel and GlobalFoundries Inc., Bloomberg has reported.

&gt;

&gt;That would have married a maker of older-generation chips with Intel’s leading-edge business. But GlobalFoundries walked away from cutting-edge production years ago and doesn’t have the money for an acquisition, so those conversations didn’t progress much past a thought exercise.

&gt;

&gt;Biden officials also floated the possibility of TSMC licensing its manufacturing technology for use at Intel’s facilities, according to multiple people familiar with the conversations. But TSMC wasn’t interested in an arrangement that could ultimately benefit a competitor, the people said. And Biden’s team was generally reluctant to take an active role in deal conversations, according to several people familiar with the situation.

&gt;

&gt;Trump, meanwhile, is not shy about cutting deals — and TSMC, which just held its board meeting in the US for the first time, is eager to maintain good relations with the new president.

&gt;

&gt;Trump has repeatedly accused Taiwan of “stealing” the US chip industry and threatened tariffs on foreign-produced semiconductors. He’s expressed a preference for using those kinds of levies to boost US chipmaking instead of government subsidies — the approach adopted by the US Chips and Science Act. That legislation, passed in 2022, led to TSMC winning $6.6 billion in grants to support three plants in Phoenix.

&gt;

&gt;

&gt;But it was also Trump’s first administration that set out to lure TSMC to the US, and top Trump officials have consistently affirmed their commitment to boosting domestic manufacturing. That’s particularly true for technologies at the heart of the US-China competition.

&gt;

&gt;The US “will ensure that the most powerful AI systems are built in the US with American-designed and manufactured chips,” Vice President JD Vance said during an AI summit in Paris earlier this week.

&gt;

&gt;The fact that TSMC is open to an Intel deal indicates a change in tune from just a few months ago. In October, CEO C.C. Wei had told analysts that his company wasn’t interested in acquiring Intel’s factories.

&gt;

&gt;Asked the same question again in January, Wei didn’t directly answer: “They are our very good customers,” he said. “I like them and they are very important to TSMC’s business also. That all I can say.”

86,TSM,Baird analyst comments on supply chain talk of Intel fab spinoff with TSMC involved,"Baird analyst Tristan Gerra says there are discussions from the Asia semiconductor supply chain that the U.S. government will get involved in potentially TSMC ($TSM) sending engineers to Intel’s ($INTC) 3nm/2nm fab, applying the company’s know-how to ensure that fab and subsequent manufacturing projects from Intel become viable.

In addition, Intel’s fab could be spun off into a new entity jointly owned by TSMC and Intel, and run by TSMC, with the new entity receiving U.S. Chip Act funding, the firm adds.

Baird says that while there is no confirmation and potential completion of this project could be lengthy, the move would make sense. Intel would benefit from significant cash flow relief, and would focus on design and platform solutions going forward, while a viable fab could finally attract key fabless companies to diversify into a geo-dependable manufacturing model, contends the analyst.

Baird has a Neutral rating on Intel.

52,TSM,Using your Roth IRA for savings/short term bonds?,"So I have two main financial goals:

1. Buy my first home - and not just any home, something's actually nice and in a good area.
2. Grow my wealth as much as possible.

To that end, this has been my strategy thus far:

* Max out my pre-tax accounts (HSA, 401k). These are invested in the total world stock market.
* Maintain $15-20k at all times in my Fidelity CMA (as sort of a combo checking account &amp; emergency fund). These funds are invested in a treasury-only MMF.
* Contribute towards my downpayment fund, which is basically 15% of the price of the most expensive home I could reasonably purchase. This is a brokerage account where I invest in 1-3 month treasuries exclusively.
* Contribute the remaining to another brokerage account, for long-term growth; with the understanding, however, that I may tap into it earlier if needed. This is invested purely in VTI and SCHX (I tax loss harvest between the too) with a small alocation for short term speculation (i.e. I put like 2% of the account into NVDA and TSM after the recent crash)

I'm wondering if I should re-evaluate this, however. As my individual income is in the high $200ks, pretty much any short term gain I make is taxed to death. At best, my downpayment fund is keeping up with inflation; but it's certainly not growing. Also - my employer &amp; 401k brokerage allows for the mega backdoor roth strategy, as well as in-service rollovers to a Roth IRA.

With that in mind, I'm wondering if I should move a portion of my downpayment fund into Roth, instead. That way the interest I'm making isn't taxed, and can be a small part of my long term growth. I figure when the time comes to buy a home, I can withdraw the principal but leave the gains in there.

Obviously I know I can't simply ""move"" the funds into my Roth IRA per se, but I could max-out my after-tax 401k contributions for the next few months, and then use my maturing bonds in my downpayment fund to either buy more stocks in my brokeage account, or cover short-term cash needs (to make up for the extra income that's going into the roth account now).

Sorry to spew all this at you, but I'd love to get your thoughts.",1,22,1738943093.0,2025-02-07T15:44:53+00:00,t3_1ijxy03,investing
53,TSM,Portfolio advice or thoughts,"I've been investing since the start of covid and after selling to pay for school I just started up again.  I'm looking for some advice and guidance on next steps.  Right now I'm on a Joint Tennant with a parent, that I need to get out of. My options seem to be, remove them with their permission from the account. Open an individual and transfer the money or a Roth IRA. My income, 29m is between 100-150k a year and I have a about 10k invested atm.

If I transfer the money to a Roth do I instantly hit the maximum? Is it worth it with my income, plus potential raises over the next 10+ years? 

I am also looking to consolidate my holdings for easier monthly purchases. My thoughts are to sell QQQM and NVDA to consolidate into VOO. However VOO is a bit hard to buy monthly due to price and how much I plan to put in, right now I'm averaging $200-500 deposits a month.

My holdings are AAPL, COST, DIS, GME, INTC, NVDA, RIVN, TSM, WM, AVUV, QQQM, SCHD, and VOO. I am leaning into ETFs and want to focus growth and divetends. If I up my monthly investments as I make more and become more financially stable I hope to get essiantls paid for by diventends sooner rather than later. I've also been looking into MSTY and JEPI...

30,TSM,Thinking about NVDA beyond 2025 Hyperscaler CapEx Growth,"With 3/4 hyperscalers reporting earnings already, the reaction to Nvidia has been positive, but stock still trades less than before DeepSeek. I believe the sentiment is that while 2025 will be great, Nvidia is nearing the ""end of great times"" and moving to a ""just good times"".

**Here's my take at a breakdown. I am not an expert, but have read a lot of positive and negative takes, I'm starting this thread to start a discussion not to pump the stock. Please don't comment ""Nvidia diamond hands durr"".** I didn't use AI to write this sadly.

I can't link out to some of the resources, but tried to describe them for easy search and find.

**TLDR:** Meeting 2025 revenue projections isn't at excessive risk based on CapEx raises so far. It's likely that production capacity may really be the limiting reagent for 2025 revenues not demand. Market is forward looking and there is uncertainity on 2026+ revenues (DeepSeek is one of them) - markets don't like that. However, uncertainity is an opportunity if Nvidia can deliver again - remember stocks climb a wall of worry.

**Disclosure:** Own a lot of NVDA. But have covered calls on them, so not a blindfold risktaker.

**Personal take:** NVDA is attractive at these levels, but I'd be cautious holding my entire position after the summer 2025 earnings calls from the hyperscalers, because if there's any indication there is a 2026 CapEx slowdown, stock could fall a lot. I can't predict the future, so diversification is important even if you like the stock.

However, continued chip innovation that maintains a competitive advantage that leads to higher end customer ROIs compared to other chip alternatives would help. Also, release of one tangible AI product would change the sentiment and game here (e.g. Robotaxis, enterprise solutions used common place for F500 companies, etc). Many are already underway - my company is releasing Gemini for all employees - this goes beyond software engineers. I think diversification across the industry (AVGO, TSM, power producers) could be valuable as time progresses as the AI use case boom happens.

\-----------------------------------------

**(1) Meeting 2025 Revenue projections isn't at excessive risk based on CapEx raises so far**

Based on [stockanalysis](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/nvda/forecast/) consensus 2024 to 2025 revenue growth is estimated to be 52%.

1. MSFT: 55.7B in 2024 to 80B in 2025
2. Google: 52.5B in 2024 to 75B in 2025
3. Meta: 39B in 2024 to 60B - 60B in 2025

Based on the numbers written above, the anticipated growth from hyperscaler capex spend is 46% (if we assume concentration of NVDA chip spend as percent of capex steady). Hyperscalers are estimated to be about 50% of Nvidia revenue. To reach the 52% target that means from the remainder of the revenue book, Nvidia needs 58% spend increase.

This doesn't seem unreasonable. **Potential** investments through StarGate (Oracle), OpenAI's increasingly independent spending funded by Softbank, and sovereign AI investments are a tailwind to that figure. However, sustained export controls (e.g. Biden's global export framework) and increased crackdowns are headwinds.

**(2) It's likely that production capacity may really be the limiting reagent for 2025 revenues not demand**

Based on multiple [sources](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidias-blackwell-gpus-are-sold-out-for-the-next-12-months-chipmaker-to-gain-market-share-in-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com), seems like Blackweel is sold out for the next 12 months anyways. So 2025 revenues may be a matter of strong production. Moreover, from the commentary that google had on their earnings call - seems like cloud growth is supply constrained by infrastructure rather than demand constrained. I believe for 2025 at least customers will buy as many NVIDIA chips as they can and its production that determines valuation.

Since the market is forward looking, 2025 revenue misses won't be as crucial as addressing the question of when is the demand going to slow down and the AI semiconductor sales from NVDA slowdown?

**(3) Market is forward looking and there is uncertainity on 2026+ revenues (DeepSeek is one of them)..markets don't like that**

No matter how you slice it, DeepSeek has provided true software driven advances that more efficiently use Nvidia GPUs and non-NVDA GPUs on the training and particularly inference level. You can look at the cost per inference token for DeepSeek vs. OpenAI. It has raised questions on the sustainability on needing cutting edge chips at high margins in the long run. Risks below.

* **Do closed loop models even have a moat over open source?**: Can closed-loop/proprietary LLMs develop models that demand a strong ROI justifying investment in more chips to **train** better models that **end users are willing to pay for**? Currently Sam Altman &amp; Dario (Antropic) think compute is the way to go. However, at some point they could discover more compute for training =/= better or more efficient models.
* **Training:** Efficiencies in hardware utilization may reduce Nvidia's moat in interconnectivity and lead to better training advances, which could reduce margins if other chips are ""somewhat as good"" eventually given demand equalizes to supply. See point # 1 in this excellent recap here  (available by searching DeepSeek and the ramification on the AI industry: winners and losers? by Rihard Jarc)
* **More use cases in a post training world could mean more inference on custom chips &amp; competitor products:** It is widely believed that Nvidia is more of an undisputed leader in training performance vs. inference. If open source models become good enough and training investments do not result in monetizable ROI, Nvidia's margins likely fall as custom chips and other semiconductor players provide good solutions. [Jevon's Paradox (more use cases and usage)](https://www.npr.org/sections/planet-money/2025/02/04/g-s1-46018/ai-deepseek-economics-jevons-paradox) is very likely here, but volume would have to increase signficantly to offset margin decreases - a risk that the market doesn't like.
* **CUDA alternatives leads to market share loses?:** CUDA is widely known to be the best option ""coding"" platform to get GPUs to do what you want right now. [However, there are other applications coming out that allow fungible usage of other chips. ](https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/17/nvidia_cuda_moat/#:~:text=If%20you're%20doing%20low,AMD%20hardware%20%E2%80%93%20and%20vice%20versa)This reduces the need to use Nvidia chips and pay such high margins. There's drawbacks to not using CUDA that I'll highlight in section 4.

Sidenote - there is an honest and excellent podcast on DeepSeek implications to Nvidia from Bankless w/ Jeffrey Emmanuel (whose blogpost got a lot of investors interested in DeepSeek impact over 2 weekends ago). Please listen.

**(4) However, uncertainity is an opportunity if Nvidia can deliver again - remember stocks climb a wall of worry.**

* **Early innings of the AI story:** Models are going to get more complex not stagnate. This requires more training compute as we try to reach AGI level models. On the inference front, as more use cases explode, there will be more general chip demand. We haven't even seen full released use cases in robotics, autonomous transit, healthcare AI, etc.
* **CUDA is the lowest latency** and provides best performance as of now. There might be a technical limit to how well alternatives perform.
* **Cost of being last** in AI is too great for hyperscalers
* **Continued innovation leadership:** Nvidia has expedited it's semiconductor cycle from 2 years to 1 year. Rubin (next gen AI chips) are already being worked on. Semiconductors are known to be cylical, but this may dull any trough cycle.
* **Increased soverign AI investments** (StarGate, Middle east, etc.)
* **Ridiculous cash flow with minimal R&amp;D** as % of revenue means that Nvidia can invest in strategic ventures, emerging tech, and adjacent spaces to diversify revenue streams. Not sure this is proven out in the financials yet, but could in the future.
* **Hopefully - reduced interest rates boosts stock valuations**.

I've included a screenshot of interviews by Rihard Jarc with a former AMD employee on CUDA and training needs going forward after DeepSeek.",61,32,1738781647.0,2025-02-05T18:54:07+00:00,t3_1iihlgz,stocks

Catalyst: Apple reported EPS of $2.40 vs. $2.35, and revenue of $124.3B vs 124B.

Despite these positive results, the company provided cautious guidance for the upcoming quarter, citing uncertainties related to the impact of new AI features on sales. Tim Cook mentioned that Apple Intelligence DID lead to stronger sales/growth in areas where it was rolled out (it has limited rollout right now).

Volume/Market Cap/Technicals: Watching $250 level, no strong bias. We've seen AAPL swing close to 20% this month, (on report of sales weakness in China) but doubt this will continue.

Context: Most immediate news that comes to mind was the weakness of sales in China for the iPhone, causing the move this month.

Risks: Don't really see immediate risks beyond the trade war, in 2019/2020 this resulted in AAPL moving manufacturing/production to other countries in SouthEast Asia- slowing growth in China has been pretty consistent, however.

Catalyst: Kerrisdale Capital released a bullish report on ACM Research (ACMR), a semiconductor wafer fabrication equipment (WFE) company positioned in China but headquartered in America.

It leads China as a leading supplier of wafer cleaning tools and beneficiary of China's push toward semiconductor self-sufficiency.

Kerrisdale predicts the company to eventually compete globally and cites it as a potential 10x return. Trades at 1x 2025E revenue (likely due to China fears).

Volume/Market Cap/Technicals: This is the interesting part- ACMR holds a $1.2B mkt cap but trades at a massive discount compared to its Chinese subsidiary (ACMS), which has a $5.9 billion market cap and trades at 6x 2025E revenue.

The report suggests that ACMR’s NASDAQ valuation is severely mispriced and could re-rate significantly as investors recognize the valuation gap.

Context: China/US chip war, you guys know what this is.

Sector Context: The global semiconductor industry is shifting, with China attempting to localize chip production.

Kerrisdale argues that restrictions on U.S. and Japanese WFE exports to China will only fuel ACMR’s growth as Chinese fabs increasingly turn to domestic suppliers.

China's WFE self-sufficiency has grown from 4% in 2019 to 17% in 2024 and is expected to reach 36% by 2026.

Risks: Geopolitical factors, including further U.S. export restrictions, could impact ACMR’s operations. Similar to how we have the NVDA trade restriction going on right now.

However, Kerrisdale sees these restrictions as a net positive due to ACMR having less competition in China as a result.

There are other players in the WFE space in China, but ACMR has a technological moat.

Sector Context: SpaceX's Starlink is also entering the direct-to-cell market, as I noted a few days ago- most of the investment that can be done in these type of cell/sat comms in public markets can really only be done in ASTS.

Risks: If SpaceX IPOs we might see a selloff in this stock simply because SpaceX is far larger/established and Elon Musk has closer ties to the government.

88,TSM,DD: What is going on with China's recent developments in quantum computing?,"Google [Tianyan-504](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=tianyan-504&amp;t=newext&amp;atb=v452-1&amp;ia=web). Google [Zuchongzhi 3.0](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=tianyan-504&amp;t=newext&amp;atb=v452-1&amp;ia=web). Google it, right now. Who’s reporting this? China is right behind the USA in quantum computing research, and the markets don't seem to have a clue.

TL;DR: Simply put, I believe the markets have not reacted to China’s most recent advancements in quantum computing. China is potentially not as far behind the USA as markets would have you believe. I provide here a commentary of recent market movements, in relation to recent quantum computing news and developments. I follow with a more technical discussion of the significance of China’s advancements, those of US corporations.

Financial disclaimer: While I justify my comments where possible, some of the comments I make in this post are pure speculation. I do not recommend making speculative trades, such as shorting quantum computing, or buying quantum cybersecurity. I am not a financial advisor, and this is not financial advice.

I was astounded to see the latest news dominating the headlines. How did the market not know that China was developing its own language-learning models? I’m a filthy casual, and even I knew about it. It’s been in our news at least [since July](https://www.marktechpost.com/2024/07/20/deepseek-v2-0628-released-an-improved-open-source-version-of-deepseek-v2/), and available for use [since September last year](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/news/news0905). It was pretty fucking good back then, too. And there’s Alibaba’s Qwenchat, Tencent’s HunYuan, among numerous others they haven’t even started talking about yet. What else have they forgotten, in this wild speculative bull run? They probably think the USA is lightyears ahead in quantum computing too. Oh, oh. They do.

Before you go any further, look up [Tianyan-504](https://english.cas.cn/newsroom/cas_media/202412/t20241206_893281.shtml). Look up [Zuchongzhi 3.0](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11924). Google them, right now. They’re right there, massive Chinese developments both announced in December 2024. The Tianyan-504 surpasses 500 qubits, on par with IBM’s latest developments. And Zuchongzhi 3.0 demolishes Google’s earlier Sycamore by all key metrics. Why can’t we find any article produced by any reputable financial sources, that discuss the significance of these achievements? There is essentially zero market news about it. China is right behind the USA in quantum computing research, and the market has no fucking clue.

Check out D-Wave stock prices, for example. Given their business model relies in part on how they contribute to research in the field, they should be negatively impacted by major research developments in competing economies.

This suggests that while Google’s Willow breakthrough rallied quantum computing stocks and Nvidia’s CEO pushed them back down, China’s developments have had zero impact.

How about Quantum Computing Inc (QUBT)? It tells a similar story. Their focus is on fabrication of photonic quantum computing components – and again, providing researchers access to quantum computing technology. It looks like Google’s Willow breakthrough rallied stocks, and Nvidia’s CEO pushed them back down. China’s developments have had zero impact.

How about IBM? News about Google’s Willow pushed their price down some 3%, which makes good sense. Willow’s performace blew that of IBM’s September R2 Heron processor out of the water. Willow is a competitor, but IBM’s position in the market means they are diversified in so much more than just quantum computing. A small bearish reaction makes perfect sense. So when Tianyan-504 reportedly challenged IBM's benchmarks just three days before Willow did, why didn’t the stock price move?

You can look at SkyWater Technologies (SKYT), and at Global Foundries (GFS), and Rigetti (RGTI), Alphabet (GOOGL), Intel (INTC), TSM (TSM), Keysight Technologies (KEYS), and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Every one of these key companies relevant to advancing quantum computing in the Western World have one thing in common. When China announces their developments, the markets appear to stay still.

There are three possible reasons for this that I have come up with. There may be other reasons as well that I am not aware of, in which case I encourage you to enlighten me.

The first possible reason is as above: The market is generally not aware. It is likely that some players in the market are aware, and this is a simple piece of information that such players will be taking advantage of – they do not have incentive to highlight this knowledge. Furthermore, the market may be uniquely slow to react. Unlike DeepSeek, which we can physically interact with, breaking records in quantum computing research is less tangible, less sensational. Breaking news, markets are irrational.

The second possible reason is simple: China may be lying. I can not find any evidence to support this idea, and China’s past claims about quantum computing, such as those about [Jiuzhang](https://asiatimes.com/2023/10/china-unveils-faster-light-based-quantum-computer/), have been demonstrably true.

The third possible reason is that China’s quantum computers are not as technically advanced as they sound. Originally I wanted to follow with a full technical discussion about the recent history of Chinese Quantum computing, and the merits of Tianyan-504 and Zuchongzhi 3.0 in comparison to western quantum computing efforts. But since I am not a subject matter expert, and I do not have the time to write in full depth. But I will provide a bit more technical information, summarise and provide references to the academic research for relevant breakthrough technologies, so you can read for yourself.

China is fighting to lead the global race in quantum computing, and [the Chinese government has been investing tens of billions of dollars into quantum computing research](https://thequantuminsider.com/2023/04/13/chinese-quantum-companies-and-national-strategy-2023/), alongside the investments of Chinese institutions and corporations.

In 2020 [Jiuzhang, developed at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), was the second quantum computer in the world to achieve quantum supremacy](https://asiatimes.com/2023/10/china-unveils-faster-light-based-quantum-computer/), and the first photonic quantum computer to do so. Since then, the university has gone on to create further models of Jiuzhang, and develop chips with greater qubit lifetime and fidelity.

In April 2024, The Center for Excellence in Quantum Information and Quantum Physics developed their [Xiaohong superconducting chip](https://english.news.cn/20240425/a95b3c190a59486886f4cddc0def31cd/c.html), their most advanced to date, anticipated to reach the chip performance levels of main international cloud-enabled quantum computing platforms such as IBM’s Heron in key performance metrics including qubit lifetime (how long a qubit can hold its quantum state) and readout fidelity (accuracy in extracting information from qubits). I note the market did not appear to react to the Xiaohong chip either.

On the 13^(th) of November 2024,[ IBM announced their Quantum Heron R2](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/qdc-2024), achieving their goal of running quantum circuits with up to 5,000 two-qubit gates, demonstrating advancements in in qubit lifetime and readout fidelity.

On the 6^(th) of December 2024, [Tianyan-504 was announced](https://english.cas.cn/newsroom/cas_media/202412/t20241206_893281.shtml), developed by China Telecom Quantum Group (CTQG) in partnership with the Chinese Academy of Sciences and QuantumCTek Co., Ltd., and, built on the Xiaohong chips. China is now the only country to achieve quantum computational advantage through both photonics and superconducting quantum computing technologies. This quantum computer will be incorporated into their quantum computing cloud platform, and made available for researcher purposes.On the 9^(th) of December, [Google’s Willow was announced](https://blog.google/technology/research/google-willow-quantum-chip/). What makes Willow exceptional, is that it provides a breakthrough solution to quantum computing’s fidelity issue. It exponentially reduces the amount of error while adding more qubits. Presumably Willow can now be scaled further, and I expect to see further developments with adding more qubits now that this challenge has been solved.

Two weeks later, on the 16^(th) of December 2024, an entirely separate research team with the China Telecom Quantum Group (CTQG) in partnership with the Chinese Academy of Sciences and QuantumCTek Co., Ltd. [announced their Zuchongzhi 3.0](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.11924v1#S1). This superconducting quantum computer makes numerous advancements, and demonstrates quantum advantage through speed. It crushes benchmarks set by Google’s older Sycamore - “Compared to Google’s latest experiment, SYC-67 and SYC-70  the classical simulation cost of our 83-qubit, 32-cycle experiment is six orders of magnitude higher.” Though Zuchongzhi 3.0 does not demonstrate the error correction capability that Willow does, their creators have commented that they believe they can replicate the same techniques in a matter of months.

Quantum computing is still twenty years away from being relevant, they say. That gives lots of time for China to catch up. And from what I can understand, China is just one breakthrough away. There are other questions, such as China’s chip manufacturing capabilities, supply chains for components, that I am unable to find good information on. The US is doing what they can politically, through trade regulation, and restricting financial investment in China’s technologies. China already has the [lead in quantum communications, and potentially in quantum sensing](https://itif.org/publications/2024/09/09/how-innovative-is-china-in-quantum/). But China holds one massive advantage: it’s regime. In contrast to the American model, where corporations closely guard their own secrets from eachother, [China is claims they invest 15 billion of dollars into coordinated, cohesive research.](https://itif.org/publications/2024/09/09/how-innovative-is-china-in-quantum/) And it is showing in their results.

Each advancement that China makes in developing its quantum computing capability, ought to remind the market that there is a risk that the lead the US enjoys in quantum computing is being threatened. But look at those google search results again. Outside of technical circles, the western media simply hasn't picked it up. Look at what happened with DeepSeek. I think the markets just don't know. Investors are already anxious about their investments in quantum computing, and are starting to demand returns. Manufacturers are reluctant to scale component production, given the low demand and potential for volatility. So when the market does find out about China’s achievements in quantum computing, what's going to happen?

Let me know what you think.

But I will provide a bit more technical information, summarise and provide references to the academic research for relevant breakthrough technologies, so you can read for yourself.

China is fighting to lead the global race in quantum computing, and [the Chinese government has been investing tens of billions of dollars into quantum computing research](https://thequantuminsider.com/2023/04/13/chinese-quantum-companies-and-national-strategy-2023/), alongside the investments of Chinese institutions and corporations.

In 2020 [Jiuzhang, developed at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), was the second quantum computer in the world to achieve quantum supremacy](https://asiatimes.com/2023/10/china-unveils-faster-light-based-quantum-computer/), and the first photonic quantum computer to do so. Since then, the university has gone on to create further models of Jiuzhang, and develop chips with greater qubit lifetime and fidelity.

In April 2024, The Center for Excellence in Quantum Information and Quantum Physics developed their [Xiaohong superconducting chip](https://english.news.cn/20240425/a95b3c190a59486886f4cddc0def31cd/c.html), their most advanced to date, anticipated to reach the chip performance levels of main international cloud-enabled quantum computing platforms such as IBM’s Heron in key performance metrics including qubit lifetime (how long a qubit can hold its quantum state) and readout fidelity (accuracy in extracting information from qubits). I note the market did not appear to react to the Xiaohong chip either.

On the 13^(th) of November 2024,[ IBM announced their Quantum Heron R2](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/qdc-2024), achieving their goal of running quantum circuits with up to 5,000 two-qubit gates, demonstrating advancements in in qubit lifetime and readout fidelity.

On the 6^(th) of December 2024, [Tianyan-504 was announced](https://english.cas.cn/newsroom/cas_media/202412/t20241206_893281.shtml), developed by China Telecom Quantum Group (CTQG) in partnership with the Chinese Academy of Sciences and QuantumCTek Co., Ltd., and, built on the Xiaohong chips. China is now the only country to achieve quantum computational advantage through both photonics and superconducting quantum computing technologies. This quantum computer will be incorporated into their quantum computing cloud platform, and made available for researcher purposes.

On the 9^(th) of December, [Google’s Willow was announced](https://blog.google/technology/research/google-willow-quantum-chip/). What makes Willow exceptional, is that it provides a breakthrough solution to quantum computing’s fidelity issue. It exponentially reduces the amount of error while adding more qubits. Presumably Willow can now be scaled further, and I expect to see further developments with adding more qubits now that this challenge has been solved.

Two weeks later, on the 16^(th) of December 2024, an entirely separate research team with the China Telecom Quantum Group (CTQG) in partnership with the Chinese Academy of Sciences and QuantumCTek Co., Ltd. [announced their Zuchongzhi 3.0](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.11924v1#S1). This superconducting quantum computer makes numerous advancements, and demonstrates quantum advantage through speed. It crushes benchmarks set by Google’s older Sycamore - “Compared to Google’s latest experiment, SYC-67 and SYC-70  the classical simulation cost of our 83-qubit, 32-cycle experiment is six orders of magnitude higher.” Though Zuchongzhi 3.0 does not demonstrate the error correction capability that Willow does, their creators have commented that they believe they can replicate the same techniques in a matter of months.

Quantum computing is still twenty years away from being relevant, they say. That gives lots of time for China to catch up. And from what I can understand, China is just one breakthrough away. There are other questions, such as China’s chip manufacturing capabilities, supply chains for components, that I am unable to find good information on. The US is doing what they can politically, through trade regulation, and restricting financial investment in China’s technologies. China already has the [lead in quantum communications, and potentially in quantum sensing](https://itif.org/publications/2024/09/09/how-innovative-is-china-in-quantum/). But China holds one massive advantage: it’s regime. In contrast to the American model, where corporations closely guard their own secrets from eachother, [China is claims they invest 15 billion of dollars into coordinated, cohesive research.](https://itif.org/publications/2024/09/09/how-innovative-is-china-in-quantum/) And it is showing in their results.

Each advancement that China makes in developing its quantum computing capability, ought to remind the market that there is a risk that the lead the US enjoys in quantum computing is being threatened. But look at those google search results again. Outside of technical circles, the western media simply hasn't picked it up. Look at what happened with DeepSeek. I think the markets just don't know. Investors are already anxious about their investments in quantum computing, and are starting to demand returns. Manufacturers are reluctant to scale component production, given the low demand and potential for volatility. So when the market does find out about China’s achievements in quantum computing, what's going to happen?

23,TSM,DD: What is going on with China's recent developments in quantum computing?,"Google [Tianyan-504](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=tianyan-504&amp;t=newext&amp;atb=v452-1&amp;ia=web). Google [Zuchongzhi 3.0](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=tianyan-504&amp;t=newext&amp;atb=v452-1&amp;ia=web). Google it, right now. Who’s reporting this? China is right behind the USA in quantum computing research, and the markets don't seem to have a clue.

TL;DR: Simply put, I believe the markets have not reacted to China’s most recent advancements in quantum computing. China is potentially not as far behind the USA as markets would have you believe. I provide here a commentary of recent market movements, in relation to recent quantum computing news and developments. I follow with a more technical discussion of the significance of China’s advancements, those of US corporations.

Financial disclaimer: While I justify my comments where possible, some of the comments I make in this post are pure speculation. I do not recommend making speculative trades, such as shorting quantum computing, or buying quantum cybersecurity. I am not a financial advisor, and this is not financial advice.

  
I was astounded to see the latest news dominating the headlines. How did the market not know that China was developing its own language-learning models? I’m a filthy casual, and even I knew about it. It’s been in our news at least [since July](https://www.marktechpost.com/2024/07/20/deepseek-v2-0628-released-an-improved-open-source-version-of-deepseek-v2/), and available for use [since September last year](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/news/news0905). It was pretty fucking good back then, too. And there’s Alibaba’s Qwenchat, Tencent’s HunYuan, among numerous others they haven’t even started talking about yet. What else have they forgotten, in this wild speculative bull run? They probably think the USA is lightyears ahead in quantum computing too. Oh, oh. They do.

Before you go any further, look up [Tianyan-504](https://english.cas.cn/newsroom/cas_media/202412/t20241206_893281.shtml). Look up [Zuchongzhi 3.0](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11924). Google them, right now. They’re right there, massive Chinese developments both announced in December 2024. The Tianyan-504 surpasses 500 qubits, on par with IBM’s latest developments. And Zuchongzhi 3.0 demolishes Google’s earlier Sycamore by all key metrics. Why can’t we find any article produced by any reputable financial sources, that discuss the significance of these achievements? There is essentially zero market news about it. China is right behind the USA in quantum computing research, and the market has no fucking clue. 

Check out D-Wave stock prices, for example. Given their business model relies in part on how they contribute to research in the field, they should be negatively impacted by major research developments in competing economies.

[D-Wave Systems: China’s announcements had no impact on its price](https://preview.redd.it/96wym59tk6ge1.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=327df2e7ebaf6e0f06138e6d7b60b044e6aec743)

This suggests that while Google’s Willow breakthrough rallied quantum computing stocks and Nvidia’s CEO pushed them back down, China’s developments have had zero impact.

How about Quantum Computing Inc (QUBT)? It tells a similar story. Their focus is on fabrication of photonic quantum computing components – and again, providing researchers access to quantum computing technology. It looks like Google’s Willow breakthrough rallied stocks, and Nvidia’s CEO pushed them back down. China’s developments have had zero impact.

[Quantum Computing Inc: China’s announcements had no impact on its price](https://preview.redd.it/p5a8zc79l6ge1.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a8b9868405de23d491e4eb752102315f975735d1)

How about IBM? News about Google’s Willow pushed their price down some 3%, which makes good sense. Willow’s performace blew that of IBM’s September R2 Heron processor out of the water. Willow is a competitor, but IBM’s position in the market means they are diversified in so much more than just quantum computing. A small bearish reaction makes perfect sense. So when Tianyan-504 reportedly challenged IBM's benchmarks just three days before Willow did, why didn’t the stock price move?

[IBM: China’s announcements had no impact on its price](https://preview.redd.it/rbp8n83bl6ge1.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=066a0a2eaac3524cb3ae527f857180cd22e21b40)

You can look at SkyWater Technologies (SKYT), and at Global Foundries (GFS), and Rigetti (RGTI), Alphabet (GOOGL), Intel (INTC), TSM (TSM), Keysight Technologies (KEYS), and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Every one of these key companies relevant to advancing quantum computing in the Western World have one thing in common. When China announces their developments, the markets appear to stay still.

There are three possible reasons for this that I have come up with. There may be other reasons as well that I am not aware of, in which case I encourage you to enlighten me.

The first possible reason is as above: The market is generally not aware. It is likely that some players in the market are aware, and this is a simple piece of information that such players will be taking advantage of – they do not have incentive to highlight this knowledge. Furthermore, the market may be uniquely slow to react. Unlike DeepSeek, which we can physically interact with, breaking records in quantum computing research is less tangible, less sensational. Breaking news, markets are irrational.

The second possible reason is simple: China may be lying. I can not find any evidence to support this idea, and China’s past claims about quantum computing, such as those about [Jiuzhang](https://asiatimes.com/2023/10/china-unveils-faster-light-based-quantum-computer/), have been demonstrably true.

The third possible reason is that China’s quantum computers are not as technically advanced as they sound. Originally I wanted to follow with a full technical discussion about the recent history of Chinese Quantum computing, and the merits of Tianyan-504 and Zuchongzhi 3.0 in comparison to western quantum computing efforts.

89,TSM,DeepSeek training cost - the $95 mil difference,"I’m sure all dip buyers &amp; bears are already tired of hearing about DeepSeek. But let’s settle one thing before we move on.

 

**Analysis of Training Cost (Total Cost of Ownership)**

What does it cost for country to launch a satellite into space? The cost to *rent* the rocket, or to build it?

If Madagascar announced they **RENTED** a spot on SpaceX dragon for $2.75 mil, your reaction is probably not “HOLY SHIT sell all space stocks / NASA is cooked / Madagascar is catching up!” **No, you’d be impressed if they BUILT the rocket for 27x cheaper than the US and launched it.**

 

**DeepSeek’s reported $5.6 Mil Cost is Rental, NOT TCO ($100 MIL):**

https://preview.redd.it/lijfzqle5tfe1.png?width=864&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0aed30ab7f2608a03eedf41aa867f87c1f9181c9

The **$5.6 million figure (*****rental cost!*****)** being thrown around to train DeepSeek-v3 doesn’t paint the whole picture. I’ll include this excerpt from Leopold A.’s (former OpenAI researcher) Situational Awareness essay when discussing ***total cost of ownership*** for training AI models:

https://preview.redd.it/yd6j5jaf5tfe1.png?width=839&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93526f2445c76fe774bf39aaf355203b5025ca89

Using Leopold's napkin math… the 40% ratio of GPU purchase cost (2,000 H800s = $45 mil) ***equates to \~$100 million to stand up a cluster needed to train DeepSeek v3!***

https://preview.redd.it/xdokt7qj5tfe1.png?width=995&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a6791b661099a6c485d41262005c395ef18710f

These numbers also don’t include paying the AI researchers (not cheap), failed training runs, and data collection costs which are significant.

**Yes, \~$100 mil is 5x cheaper than \~500 mil it took for training ChatGPT4.** **But acting like 3 guys in their basement cooked up a competitor to OpenAI for some hedge fund pocket change ($5.6 mil) is categorically false.**

33,TSM,I dont understand the reasoning of Deepseek causing NVDA to drop so massively,"The very gist of Deepseek is that it was able to develop a new AI model at a very quick turn around time and at a very reduced price.

however, its still using NVDA chips. it doesnt hurt NVDA at all. they can literally restrict supply chain. or just only continue to produce expensive flagships.

if Deepseeks tech caused companys that are also developing AI, such as Google, Open AI, MSFT, etc, that can somewhat make sense.

but i dont understand the hit on the company's thats designing/making the chips.

  
at the end of the day, they are still going to, and have to , rely on NVDA and TSM.

  
so why does this have an impact on NVDA?",3,96,1738052810.0,2025-01-28T08:26:50+00:00,t3_1ibx21s,stocks

34,TSM,TSM vs Nvidia,"Obviously, Trump announcing he'll invest $500 billion into AI is a big boom for Nvidia. But how will Trump's tariffs impact Nvidia's future sells? 

That got my thinking - what company would benefit from Trump's announcement while being immune from his tariffs? The conclusion I came to is TSMC (TSM).

Nvidia, and pretty all tech companies in the world, contracts TSMC (TSM) to make their semiconductors and chips for them. If Nvidia sales improve, TSMC's sales will improve. And because TSMC is a Taiwanese company, they're not going to be impacted by Trump's tariffs...unless Trump decides to put tariffs on Taiwan which seems unlikely.

What does everyone think? Is TSM a better investment than Nvidia?",0,27,1737723533.0,2025-01-24T12:58:53+00:00,t3_1i8usl1,stocks

Anyone who was around at the time can testify that this really did represent consensus opinions in this sub at that time, which you can see in the comments of that post.  Note that the game store madness did not really begin until a couple weeks later, which is why it did not appear there.

I felt like it was going to play out poorly so I bookmarked it, and now have been doing yearly updates.  After all, for something like this, you really need to give it a multiple year timeline at least.

We are now on year 4, and to date I have sarcastically remarked about how the sharp, financial geniuses of the time performed against SPY and VTI.  This year I was rather surprised at the results.  All 2025 numbers use the prices right now.

I am looking for any recommendations you all might have to improve my strategy/risk management or increase efficiency of my strategy. I want to ask questions right now while the going is good in order to be prepared for any risks down the road. Thanks in advance!

So, I have around 8 stocks at any given time, 4 of which are permanent/long-term positions (TSLA, NVDA, LMT, and SPY). I know the allocation is a bit tech heavy, but this is my secondary portfolio seeking higher risk/reward (late 20s guy). This portfolio is used to gain tech exposure and generate income. My Merrill portfolio is diversified and relatively more conservative.

Overall, my approach is buying stocks (round lots only) and selling calls on some of those stocks; I sell puts in this environment as well since I want to amass shares.

I buy round lots mainly to be able to sell options for (1) downside protection, (2) if a stock has moved by a lot within a short span of time (TSLA), and (2) generate weekly income (at this time, AVGO, TSM, RGTI) - this is partly done on margin (\~35-40% at a time). So far, I have made more than enough to cover margin (but please tell me if I am not seeing a risk besides getting caught holding in a yearlong downturn, in which case I will transfer cash from my HYSA).

For the long-term holds, I almost always sell 0.15-0.2 delta calls at least 1 year out (if they get assigned, additionally saves me from STCG?). Tesla is overvalued but by selling many worthless calls, I have lowered my cost basis to around 195. That money goes to cash balance, of course (just mentally, I think this way).

For income-generators, I don’t care if I could have made more money by holding, I just want the weekly premium that the 0.3-0.35 delta options provide (might as well take some advantage of the high volatility in the market). If they get assigned, I don’t defend/roll the position (never ever buy it back at a loss - cardinal rule after November 2024). The large sweep down in November were two TSLA calls that I bought back, ran me down -12K (that's why I adjusted my TSLA strategy accordingly, same with NVDA).

For the income stocks thus far, I have observed that the price of the underlying moves into favorable territory for the short call/put if I just let it ride towards expiry. Most of the times, I close a short option position on Friday morning and pocket 90-95% premium. If it moves very quickly, say 30% in a day or two, I close it and move on to the next trade. I have been assigned a few times now, and I made a profit because I always select strikes above my cost basis.

Psychology: Sometimes I buy 20 extra shares (per round lot) so that I have some upside exposure (I’ve found this helps me mitigate FOMO and even lets me build some discipline, which has been invaluable).

Mainly, I would like your opinions/critiques on my strategy; let me know if you need more detail. Also, what can I do to prevent those big drawdowns (the weird chart lines highlighted in red) - those make me a bit uncomfortable; overall, not a big issue right now but I can foresee some problems during a downturn. Better yet, what to do to mitigate big downswings but maintain a consistent upwards trajectory? I have SPY in my other portfolio, so I am not looking to add more SPY and chill here as well.

255,TSM,"TSMC confident CHIPS Act funding will continue under Trump, says CFO","U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has accused Taiwan of “stealing” his country’s chip industry. But Taiwan’s biggest chip company is confident the Trump administration will continue funding its projects in the U.S.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co has been promised $6.6 billion under the Joe Biden administration’s CHIPS and Science ACT to help build three cutting-edge chip fabrication plants in Arizona as part of U.S. efforts to onshore chip manufacturing.

Speaking to CNBC’s Emily Tan in an exclusive interview, TSMC Chief Financial Officer Wendell Huang said the funding was expected to continue to roll in gradually under Trump as the fabrication plants pass construction and production milestones. 

“As a matter of fact, in the fourth quarter, we already received the first batch of government support,” Haung said, revealing the contract chip manufacturer had got $1.5 billion in funds. 

Following some production delays, the first fabrication plant in Arizona started producing advanced chips in the fourth quarter of last year, Huang said. He added that the construction of two plants in Arizona was on track, with the second expected to be operational in 2028.

TSMC’s first investment in Arizona was announced in May 2020, with the company’s total investment in the its three projects there eventually standing at over $65 billion.

Much of the investments were committed after the Biden administration signed the bipartisan CHIPS Act in August 2022, committing almost $53 billion to invest in the domestic semiconductor supply chain and counter China.

While the incoming President is also expected to make competition with China and onshoring manufacturing a priority in his second term, there has been debate as to whether Trump and the Republican-led House would re-examine the CHIPS Act. 

During his campaign for the White House, Trump publicly criticized the bill and its price tag, arguing instead that tariffs were a more effective strategy to onshore chip manufacturing. The President-elect also accused Taiwan of “stealing” U.S. chip business.

However, industry experts have told CNBC that they expect Trump to leave the policy mostly intact due to its bipartisan support in Washington. 

TSMC on Thursday reported record profit for the fourth quarter on strong demand for its AI chips, sending its shares up nearly 4%. Shares closed 1.36% higher on Friday.

In an earnings call following the esults, CEO and Chairman C.C. Wei highlighted TSMC’s “long-standing and good relationship” with the U.S. government and the commitment and support it has received on the federal, state and city levels. 

“Let me assure you that we have a very frank and open communication with the current government and with the future one also,” he said in response to an investor question. 

On Thursday, Wei also said that the company would not attend Trump’s inauguration as it prefers to keep a low profile.

6,TSM,TSMC: The Backbone of Global AI Chipmaking,"Summary:

* **Global Leadership in AI Chips:** TSMC dominates the semiconductor market, producing over 90% of the globe’s most advanced chips, crucial for AI and HPC applications.
* **Geopolitical Risks:** Taiwan’s political tensions with China and U.S. export restrictions could affect TSMC, but its Arizona expansion helps mitigate risks.
* **Strong Market Position:** Partnerships with Nvidia, Apple, and AMD highlight TSMC’s technological edge, particularly with 3nm and 5nm nodes.
* **Investment Potential:** Despite challenges, TSMC's 2025 focus on AI growth, HPC revenue, and strategic diversification underscores its value as a long-term investment.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is the global leader in advanced chip manufacturing, powering the AI revolution with its cutting-edge technology. As the primary supplier for tech giants like Nvidia, Apple, and AMD, TSMC produces over 90% of the world’s most advanced semiconductors, which are essential across industries, from military systems to consumer electronics. The company’s dominance is driven by its consistent investment in leading-edge processes, including 3nm and 5nm nodes, which form the backbone of high-performance computing and AI applications.

However, TSMC faces significant geopolitical risks due to its concentration in Taiwan, a region under constant tension with China, which views Taiwan as a breakaway province. A disruption in TSMC’s operations could spark a global semiconductor crisis, impacting economies worldwide. To mitigate these risks, TSMC has been diversifying its production capabilities, with a notable $40 billion investment in its Arizona facility. This expansion strengthens supply chain resilience and ensures U.S. access to cutting-edge chips for AI, defense, and other critical technologies. Additionally, the U.S. CHIPs Act offsets the high operational costs of U.S.-based facilities and supports workforce development.

TSMC’s position as the backbone of the AI and HPC sectors is underscored by its strategic collaboration with Nvidia to produce advanced AI chips, such as the Blackwell series, further cementing its role as a critical supplier in this rapidly growing market. In Q3 2024, TSMC’s revenue grew by 36% year-over-year, driven by strong AI-related demand, and it projects that mid-50% of its total revenue will come from HPC applications in 2025.

Despite its strengths, TSMC must navigate industry challenges, including the cyclical nature of the semiconductor market, declining PC and smartphone demand, and Wall Street's caution over potential growth slowdowns. Innovations in AI-driven consumer technologies and CES product launches could help revitalize these segments, with TSMC’s advanced chipmaking capabilities playing a central role.

From a valuation perspective, TSMC’s forward P/E ratio of 22.81 and PEG ratio of 0.73 suggest that while the stock trades at a premium, it remains reasonable given the company’s earnings growth and leadership in the AI sector. Geopolitical risks, while significant, are partially mitigated by the company’s diversification and reduced reliance on China, which now accounts for only 10% of its revenue.

TSMC has outperformed the semiconductor market benchmark (SMH) due to its advanced technology and strategic partnerships, recovering more quickly from market selloffs and demonstrating strong resilience. The company’s ability to balance geopolitical risks, invest in cutting-edge technologies, and sustain high demand for its products positions it as an attractive long-term investment.

In conclusion, TSMC’s leadership in semiconductor innovation and its critical role in AI chipmaking make it indispensable to the global technology industry. While challenges remain, its proactive approach to diversification and its focus on high-growth sectors like AI and HPC ensure its continued success and solidify its appeal as an investment in 2025.

TLDR: TSMC is a global leader in semiconductor manufacturing, pivotal for AI chipmaking with unmatched technological dominance. While geopolitical risks and U.S.-China tensions pose challenges, the company’s strategic expansions, such as its Arizona facilities, and its robust growth in AI-driven markets make it a compelling investment in 2025.

92,TSM,TSM Earnings: Is AVGO's 2024 Revenue Quadrupling to $90B? The Signs Point to YES!,"Broadcom (AVGO) is on the verge of an explosion, and it's all thanks to AI. Their recent earnings call wasn't just good; it was a game-changer. **And guess what? TSM's latest earnings call just confirmed everything!**

CEO Hock Tan predicts AVGO's AI chip market (XPUs and networking) could reach **$60 BILLION to $90 BILLION by 2027**! That's up from around $12 billion today. We're talking about a potential **4x increase or more** – the same kind of growth that made Nvidia what it is today.

**Here's the key:**

* **TSM Confirms the Trend:** TSM, the world's leading chip manufacturer and a key supplier for Broadcom, reported HUGE demand for AI chips in their recent earnings call 

&gt;we now forecast the revenue growth from AI accelerators to approach a mid-40% CAGR for the five-year period starting off the already higher base of 2024. We expect AI accelerator to be the strongest driver of our HPC platform growth and the largest contributor in terms of our overall incremental revenue growth in the next several years. 

* This is a major indicator that the AI chip boom is REAL and Broadcom is in the right place at the right time.
* **Hyperscaler Demand:** Three major cloud companies (hyperscalers) are driving this growth, and Broadcom is working with two more.
* **Custom Chips are King:** Google's Gemini uses Broadcom's custom chips (TPUs). This proves that specialized chips are essential for large-scale AI. Off-the-shelf just won't cut it.
* **VMware Integration:** The VMware acquisition is successful and profitable.
* **Broadcom's Expertise:** They're the best at designing and making these custom AI chips.

Broadcom is positioned to dominate the AI chip market, just like Nvidia. The growth won't be overnight, but the long-term potential is massive.

Here's the kicker: AVGO's revenue could potentially quadruple, yet the stock price is only up around 20% in the past month! **This means there's a HUGE gap between the potential future value and the current price.** AVGO is seriously undervalued right now.

**TL;DR:** AVGO is about to become a major player in the AI chip market. $60-90 billion in potential revenue by 2027 (possibly 4x growth or more), driven by custom chip demand from big cloud companies. TSM's earnings call confirms this is happening NOW. **The stock price hasn't caught up to the potential yet, meaning there's a lot of room to grow.** This could be the next NVDA.",42,34,1737036904.0,2025-01-16T14:15:04+00:00,t3_1i2ptxt,wallstreetbets

256,TSM,TSMC net profit hits record high as fourth-quarter results top expectations on robust AI chip demand,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s fourth-quarter revenue and profit beat expectations, as demand for advanced chips used in artificial intelligence applications continued to surge.

Here are TSMC’s fourth-quarter results versus LSEG consensus estimates:

Net revenue: 868.46 billion New Taiwan dollars ($26.36 billion), vs. NT$850.08 billion expected
Net income: NT$374.68 billion, vs. NT$366.61 billion expected

TSMC profit rose 57% from a year earlier to a record high, while revenue jumped 38.8%. The firm had forecast fourth-quarter revenue between $26.1 billion and $26.9 billion.

As the world’s largest contract chip manufacturer TSMC produces advanced processors for clients such as Nvidia and Apple and has benefited from the megatrend in favor of AI.

TSMC’s high-performance computing division, which encompasses artificial intelligence and 5G applications, drove sales in the fourth quarter, contributing 53% of revenue. That HPC revenue was up 19% from the previous quarter.

“The surging demand for AI chips has exceeded expectations in Q4,” Brady Wang, associate director at Counterpoint Research told CNBC, adding that revenue was also bolstered by demand for the advanced chips in Apple’s latest iPhone 16 model.

The Taiwan-based company first released its December revenue last week, bringing its annual total to NT$ 2.9 trillion — a record-breaking year in sales since the company went public in 1994.


“We observed robust AI related demand from our customers throughout 2024,” Wendell Huang, chief financial officer and vice president at TSMC, said in an earnings call on Thursday, adding that revenue from AI accelerator products accounted for “close to a mid-teens percentage” of total revenue in 2024.

“Even after more than tripling in 2024, we forecast our revenue from AI accelerators to double in 2025 as a strong surge in AI-related demand continues as a key enabler of AI applications,” Huang added.

However, TSMC may face some headwinds in 2025 from U.S. restrictions on advanced semiconductor shipments to China and uncertainty surrounding the trade policy of President-elect Donald Trump.

TSMC Chairman and CEO C.C. Wei said the company will not attend Trump’s inauguration as its philosophy is to keep a low profile, Reuters reported.

Trump, who will assume office next week, has threatened to impose broad tariffs on imports and has previously accused Taiwan of “stealing” the U.S. chip business. .

Still, Counterpoint’s Wang forecasts 2025 to be another strong year for TSMC, with significant revenue growth fueled by strong and expanding demand for AI applications, both in diversity and volume.

Taiwan-listed shares of TSMC gained 81% in 2024 and were trading 3.75% higher on Thursday.

257,TSM,Emerging Stocks Enter Correction as Traders Weigh US Policies,"Emerging-market stocks index entered correction territory Thursday, the result of a months-long rout brought on by uncertainty over US policies and China’s growth prospects.


The MSCI EM stock index dropped 0.4% and registered a 10% loss since an Oct. 2 high, marking a correction. The slide was led by Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. as new measures planned by the Biden administration are set to expand semiconductor trade restrictions to most of the world.

Heavily weighted by China equities, the index has suffered from steep losses in shares from the world’s second-largest economy as the government’s stimulus package fell short of investor expectations.

A similar gauge for developing currencies fell for a second day as the dollar gained.

This is just on data centers.

Who are the biggest beneficiaries?

My top 10 favorites that will benefit once MSFT opens the faucet and sends out the orders for equipment.

1. NVDA- No explanation needed.
2. SMCI- (My personal Fav) A close NVDA partner and survivor of a Hindenburg short attack. Earnings growth is just unprecedented. Hope they covered their short.                                                                                       -https://www.supermicro.com/en/solutions/data-management
3. TSM
4. AMD - NVDA's cousin
5. MSFT - Microsoft investing in itself
6. VRT-Data center infrastructure
7. AVGO
8. ORCL
9. Dell
10. OKLO-for power

18,TSM,Selling Now is Equivalent to Selling Low. ,"It's been a rough December, for those who are results based peaked 251%, now sitting at 190% YTD. Cash is a position, been very tempted to cut some of my LEAPS, take profit on some big winners. 

However, the Fear and Greed index is sitting at 28! This is the premiere time to get in on deals imo, this only happens 3-4 times per year even in 2022. The market in the end always rebounds.

https://preview.redd.it/d7bnrbl3o9ae1.png?width=1345&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78f67f1b54d70f5fdf7a6190ba1c1ce2d4e28608

Selling now would be the equivalent of buying high and selling low, it can seem tempting now to cut and run but these are the moments when the best deals are around. 

Never going to catch the bottom perfectly, never going to sell the top perfectly, market may decline more and as much as it hurts to see hedges kick-in and port ooze profits, selling now with FGI at 28 feels even more foolish.

Positions will consider: NVDA has CES presentation Jan. 7-10th, TSM will report it's earning's first week of Jan. and they always reveal early idk why, this should imo help the market rebound as we'll see the AI spending continuing full speed. NVDA and AVGO 21dte calls will be how I'll play the rebound most likely which suspect happens within next two weeks if not Feb.  ",115,54,1735687232.0,2024-12-31T23:20:32+00:00,t3_1hqqkar,options

With solid support on Friday off the 20 day moving average and a quick above average volume recovery form the sell-off on the 18th, TSM is my top candidate going into the new week.

The base is about ten weeks old and has four tightening price contractions. It does look ready to go here and offers a low risk entry. My main concern is the overall market right now and the lack of decent set-ups.

But regardless of my market opinion, I'm  looking forward to Monday to see what direction it and the general market trade in. I'd like to get a position started and maybe add to it on any subsequent pullbacks.",10,6,1735505393.0,2024-12-29T20:49:53+00:00,t3_1hp5gqv,StockMarket

- **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (standard deviation of daily log returns) of the underlying asset and compare that to the current implied volatility (IV) of the option price. We use the same DTE as a look back period. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium associated with the pricing of options (implied volatility).
    
- **Directional Bias:** Ranges from negative (bearish) to positive (bullish) and accounts for RSI, price trend, moving averages, and put/call skew over the past 6 weeks.

- **Priced Move:** given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move.

- **Expiration:** 2024-12-27.

- **Call/Put Premium:** How much extra you are paying for the implied move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean options are ""cheaper."" High numbers mean options are ""expensive.""

- **Efficiency:** This factor represents the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price of the option. It represents how much traders will pay in slippage with a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.

58,TSM,2.5 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks,"I bought the dip on several 'pandemic stocks' that had significant declines (70%+) in 2022 and started sharing public updates 1-2 times a year.

In Q3 2023 I began reallocating into AI-related stocks when I developed strong conviction. I'm also working on a self-funded AI startup, which keeps me in the loop on AI.

Returns have been strong and continue to give me the runway to work on my startup and support my family after leaving my corporate tech job. There's more context in my previous updates linked below.

(*\*) Short term capital gain/loss held for &lt;1yr*

I held several companies (\*) for a short time to spread out my AI bets, but some of the increasingly high P/E ratios concerned me (PLTR, TSLA, etc.).

So, I sold them and purchased more NVIDIA. This approach is considered risky, but I have strong conviction in their relative valuation, defensibility, and long-term prospects.

In this case I believe that 'diversification' among AI stocks would do more to dilute my returns than mitigate my risks. Particularly because they're all highly correlated and despite its market cap, Nvidia has the most reasonable valuation all things considered. We'll see if the bet pays off.

To clarify, I am confident in the long-term prospects of Palantir, Tesla, and others, but I'm just not comfortable with the valuations. I may reassess in the future when I have new information or valuations change.

Meta is the only other stock I held onto, given my bullish view on their AI and hardware strategy combined with their attractive valuation.

# Unrealized (current investments)

* **Meta (META):** \+367.97%
* **Nvidia (NVDA):** \+117.05%

Nvidia's performance here is understated since I recently increased my holdings, but it's up \~200% since I initially purchased it last year after dithering for months.

These returns are less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I’d like to maintain some anonymity around it.

# Rate of return (IRR)

My annual return (IRR) for this portfolio (Jun 2022 to Dec 2024) is **73.6%**.

# Investment thesis

See a summary of my investment thesis in a [previous update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/). **TL;DR:**

&gt;“…AI is another secular trend like PCs (Windows, Mac), the internet (browsers, search, social) and mobile (iOS, Android, wearables). The difference is that new technology like AI can now spread faster than ever before and get used in new ways. Every new epoch uniquely benefits from the past, potentially bending the growth curve in new ways.

&gt;The other difference is that Nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation. Therefore, the \~350% run up over the last 12 months doesn’t make NVIDIA the stock of the last year, but rather it’s the stock of the next decade. The recent 3X gain will be a blip compared to what’s coming thanks to NVIDIA’s CUDA (moat), among [other things](https://stratechery.com/2023/nvidia-on-the-mountaintop/).”

&gt;\- [1.5 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/), Nov. 2023

# Nvidia's dominance

I'm still working through my thoughts here, but my strong conviction around Nvidia comes in part from these observations:

* Nvidia is [founder-led](https://www.amazon.com/Nvidia-Way-Jensen-Huang-Making/dp/1324086718/) and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies.
* It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage.
* This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy.
* AI will consistently make software easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now).
* Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints.

# We still underestimate the AI opportunity

Most importantly, we’ve barely scratched the surface of AI’s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find.

We have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before.

# Final thoughts

I'm still well within the '*maybe I'm just lucky*' phase since it's only been a couple years. Towards the end of [my last update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1d758m7/2_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/) I also shared a few ways my investment approach has changed, which I’m still benefiting from.

I expect my next update to be the 3-year update in mid 2025.

This strategic partnership enables NVIDIA to leverage TSMC’s technological advancements, further solidifying its leadership in the AI space.

Industry Outlook and Strategic Advantage

While TSMC’s sales dipped 12.2% from October, the company’s year-over-year growth and the upward trend in AI adoption suggest a long-term positive outlook for NVIDIA. As analysts project NT$849 billion in TSMC revenue for the December quarter, meeting this target would further validate the strength of NVIDIA’s demand pipeline.

The AI sector’s explosive growth has been a key driver for NVIDIA, whose stock has already experienced significant gains in 2024. With TSMC’s revenue figures reinforcing the broader AI market momentum, NVIDIA remains a critical player poised to capitalize on this trend.

Conclusion: A Bright Future

TSMC’s strong performance is a bellwether for NVIDIA’s continued success in the AI market. As AI applications expand across industries, NVIDIA’s leadership in GPU innovation and its strategic relationship with TSMC position the company for sustained growth.

I also live in Japan, which kind of sucks cause market opens at 10:30 pm (now its 11:30 pm) and that's when I really want to sleep cause I also have a day job.

https://preview.redd.it/dewgm04azd5e1.png?width=2140&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66d805d17cab4062fe3d74387acaee1367ea3025

At point **(A)** I knew close to nothing about selling options. I kind of knew about ""wheeling"" , ""premiums"" and such, but have never done it practically. So I started little by little selling very far OTM calls or puts for very little premium just to get a feel for it. I come from an engineering background so I started studying the greeks, but to be honest I didn't really get them at that time. I didn't really know how to chose a date of expiration, what's the correlation with IV and such, and what triggers a high IV. Thinking I'll slowly get it, I kept selling for very little premium.

At point **(B)** I got a bit confident and started selling more aggressive or closer to ATM options. I studied more about other options combinations like iron condors and such and also started to understand the connection between IV and earnings, IV goes up in anticipation of earnings, making premiums higher. I remember shorting an iron condor on ANF (Abercrombie and F), but since earnings was approaching, both legs of the iron condor were in the red. I closed the calls and fortunately ANF beat earnings so I got the full premium on the puts. It was a good day, but a bit too risky for my taste, and it was the first time I experienced IV expansion and IV crush on my position closely. During that time weed stocks had some high premium so I sold some on those too.

Between points **(C)** and **(D)** I think I was super busy and didn't do much selling.

By point **(D)** I made a decision to formalise my progress and actualy follow a strategy. The strategy was:  
\- Get companies with earnings in the following week.  
\- Sell a spread on the day right after earnings on the opposite side of the stock move, with expiration next Friday, at about 0.2 delta, profit from IV crush.  
This worked fairly well since I learned from before to avoid earnings and do all of my selling after earnings or with no earnings in the next few weeks. On top of this I also sold some spreads on TSLA, RDDT, TSM, MU, ARM etc, mostly 1-2 weeks to expiration at about 0.2 delta.

At point **(E)** felt pretty good about myself and got greedy. That's when I met the proverbial steamroller. It was 10:30 pm JST (9:30 am open in NY) I was in my bed sleepy on my phone with the IBKR app open, I check ASML on a whim and see the IV is very high. At the same time I checked the section for future events and it said None. Thought great, no earnings soon so let's sell a put spread pretty far OTM for about 600$ credit with a max loss of 5k$. It was a very big singular bet for me at that time, but ASML is ASML and no one like it right in the mid of the AI boom, so how can the price fall. I close my phone and sleep. Wake up check my phone see ASML tank 30%. and my portofolio being 5k lighter. It was painful. I still don't know why it said No events comming up.

I learnt then to always double check the earnings dates, and not rely just on the IBKR app, and never sell for more risk than 1% of my portofolio.

At point **(F),** after taking a big L, I decided to use some better tools to help me pick stocks to sell options on, so I built a python based screener using yfinance that first takes the top 100 stocks by weekly volume, gets their option chains, and ranks iron condors based on expected earnings (ER) ratio to risk. Figure 2 above shows a list of top iron condors with expiration next week on 13.12.2024. The screener also filters out stocks with less than 3 weeks to earnings (DTE). So now the strategy is:  
\- Short weekly iron condors on liquid and high IV stocks picked by my screener, short legs at 0.2 delta or lower, with more than 3 weeks to earnings.   
\- If assigned, sell CCs or CSPs further out.  
I've been running this for the last 2 months with pretty good results, and also found out that on good weeks where there is volatility in different sectors and I end up opening more positions, it does better overall.

So that was my journey so far, starting from no knowledge, taking things slowly, getting some progress in, getting greedy, getting wrecked and slowly finding a route to consitent profits.

Overall what I learned is:  
\- don't do anything before earnings  
\- minimise your risk per position to 1% of portofolio  
\- open many positions

Hope this was helpful for any of you in your thetagang journey. Feel free to roast my strategies.",63,53,1733561065.0,2024-12-07T08:44:25+00:00,t3_1h8odi2,thetagang
258,TSM,TSMC in talks with Nvidia for AI chip production in Arizona,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co is in discussions with Nvidia Corp to produce its Blackwell artificial intelligence chips at the contract manufacturer's new plant in Arizona, three sources familiar with the matter said.

TSMC is already making preparations to start production early next year, the sources said.

Nvidia's Blackwell chips, which the company unveiled in March, have so far been manufactured at TSMC's facilities in Taiwan. The company has seen high demand from customers involved in generative AI and accelerated computing for the chips, which it says is 30 times speedier at tasks like serving up answers from chatbots.

The agreement, if finalised, would secure another customer for TSMC's Arizona facility, which is scheduled to start volume production next year.

TSMC and Nvidia declined to comment. The sources did not want to be identified as the talks were confidential.

Two of the sources said Apple (AAPL) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are current customers at the Arizona plant. Apple and AMD did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

However, while TSMC plans to produce the front-end process of Nvidia's Blackwell chips in Arizona, the chips will still need to be shipped back to Taiwan for packaging. The Arizona facility does not have chip on wafer on substrate (CoWoS) capacity that is essential to the Blackwell chips, two of the sources said.

All of TSMC's CoWoS capacity is currently in Taiwan.

Taiwan's TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, is investing tens of billions of dollars in building three facilities in Phoenix and the project has won significant subsidies from the U.S. government which wants to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the United States.

21,TSM,Bull put spread and short put with same DTE ,"Would appreciate any input here.

I have a sell put option on TSM at strike price of 180 expiring jan17.

Failing to realise it was the same DTE, I sold another put credit spread at 180/175 with the same expiration date and I received the credit for it. 

However when I look at my platform, the bull put spread doesn’t show up and I still see only the short put which I previously have, and there’s still only 1 position open instead of 2? And the long put is missing.

100,TSM,Finally Hit $100k in Robinhood After Years of Grind,"First post ever on Reddit albeit a long one so buckle up fellow degens!
Been lurking for 6 years, finally made a new Reddit account to share this milestone. Started this journey back in 2017 in Robinhood, rode the highs and lows, and at one point even saw my portfolio drop to just ~$1K back in July 2022 (see screenshot #2) . But here we are in 2024, looking at ~$110k and up $47k (~76%) all-time! (Still quite can’t beat the benchmark yet; SPY’s got me outpaced in the long term 🥲)

The Ups and Downs

Looking back, it’s been one heck of a rollercoaster. As you can see in my all-time chart, there were some major dips along the way. The journey wasn’t linear; there were times when I felt like the portfolio was just bleeding out, but I stuck with it, made some strategic moves, and kept adding funds whenever possible. 

After starting with the modest account balance of about roughly 18k back in Q4 2017, I steadily added funds to my portfolio over time, especially after seeing triple digit returns in NVDA, SQ and double digit gains in bunch of blue chip stocks; held some Chinese stocks like Luckin Coffee (before it got delisted from NASDAQ) . Got the account to a decent level.
Then went completely ‘regard’ and got into options 😅. Did well initially then hit the rock bottom reaching as low as $998 (see aforementioned screenshot #2). Added about 9-12k over next few months (see screenshot #3) to be able to trade again. No options but used margin money to almost double my account first. Then, as the bull market kicked in after bottoming out in October 2023, the account continued to rise. Later, I employed slightly more aggressive options strategies to reach my current position.

Key Moves 
The past 18 months have been all about- researching a shit ton (more!) and making mostly informed decisions mixing with some gut feeling, using Reddit (of course), stocktwits, yahoo finance, various research firms, reports, interviews, Fidelity, CNBC, etc

Current Portfolio includes: 
•	PLTR, bunch of Semi stocks including NVDA, TSM.
•	Blue Chips (duh!) 
•	Growth stocks like SOFI, SQ, 
 •	ETFs and a few dividend/yield stocks like QQQ, IJH, XLE, JPEQ, etc. 
•	Credit Put Spreads, LEAPS, CSPs, and CCs
	•	PLTR and semi stocks, plus bluechi
Missed out on a 10x gain on NVDA (sold too early); funny enough never went long on TSLA or got into some of the group’s fav stonks from back in 2020-21 (you know which ones 💪🏽), but holding PLTR since 2020 has been solid.
I also hold stuff long term on other platforms- Fidelity and Webull including most of my PLTR shares. Can’t go full degen and YOLO everything just on Robinhood alone; you gotta diversify 😭

Shoutout to all the legends here on WallStreetBets for the crazy ideas, inspiration, and advice. Couldn’t have done it without this community! Here’s to even bigger gains ahead. Let’s keep riding this wave together! ",4388,299,1732920719.0,2024-11-29T22:51:59+00:00,t3_1h2y4dg,wallstreetbets

104,TSM,5k -&gt; 15k — 10k gains - cheers MSTR ,"Reposting again cause my last post sucked according to the automod. 

I’ve been a lurking here for a few years but happy to report I’ve finally got out from behind the Wendy dumpster. 

A few screens shots to show the journey from 2020 meme, through some ass kicking in 2022, through TSM gains mid year and recovered again with MSTR. Also, I got lucky yesterday cause I stupidly took a screenshot and perhaps should’ve sold, but good thing I didn’t and was too stubborn to sell. 

Although MSTR is still ripping, I wanted to secure gains as I’ve shot myself too many times in the foot (looking at you meme stock of 2020). It has taken me 4 years to recover what I’ve started with and I’m glad to finally have some money to move out 🫡 - wow the limited sell order function, what a concept lmao 

Trying to not let look at the missed tendies had I waited 30mins but gains aren’t gains until you lock them in. 

Positions were 412.5c, 440c and 500c all expiring this Friday. 

Screen grabs:
1) todays gains 
2) this year’s return 
3) “if it’s good enough for a screenshot, sell” but too stupid to do it
4) all time return  
5) sell orders for MSTR",46,28,1732119067.0,2024-11-20T16:11:07+00:00,t3_1gvt1rh,wallstreetbets
105,TSM,~$500&gt;$15k ,"3 months ago I put $500 into my account with the goal of seeing if I could take that and “make the small number bigger”. It’s not some massive million dollar gain or anything but I’m proud of it!

My rules were 

1. Try to double the money each of the first few plays
2. Once I had around $2k, don’t risk it all in one place
3. Make enough to actually create a long term position. 
4. Even if you lose, do not deposit any money into the account outside of “Invest with Rewards” from a Schwab American Express. 

I didn’t know much about options, and am still learning but I’ve lurked here a bit and have a few shares in AI &amp; semiconductor companies in a Roth IRA that I’ve had for years (mainly TSM at around $50/share). Most of my gain has come from RKLB, TSM, and GRMN with the GRMN and TSM funding the RKLB calls that gave me the largest jump. 

My work schedule can be hectic and I needed something that I wouldn’t have to check for a few days if I was working during market hours so these fit the bill. I had tried the QQQ thing and sort of either lost or was neutral with it. My balls aren’t big enough for that yet. 

I have a lot to learn, but I’m thinking my best course of action is going to be to take the gains I’ve made, and use them to execute the remaining 8 RKLB calls I have to give myself a nice long term base.

Seems oversold, we are close to pre-earnings levels. Great profit margin around 40%, growing revenues, stable debt, and forward p/e around 21. Seems like a steal!

I get the onshoring trade, but lets get real, NVDA has been working with TSM for a very long time and their processes won't be replicated overnight. The standards for these chips are astronomical to get it right and NVDA has accelerated their manufacturing process with synopsys to speed up their progress.

I get the geopolitical risks as well, but isn't big boy T supposed to bring calm and comfort to the world (or so his supporters think).

Papa Elom also using NVDA chips and likely wants to protect the pipeline as TSM gradually creates new fabs in the USA. As long as they are making progress towards this goal, seems like a reasonable investment. Big boy and Elom wont let the pipeline get disrupted overnight, its too valuable and there would be huge repercussions for china I am sure.

Tarrifs likely to be paid by NVDA and hyperscalers but sure they will get a carve out and pay no tarrifs.",14,56,1730919077.0,2024-11-06T18:51:17+00:00,t3_1gl5wim,wallstreetbets
36,TSM,"Trump Election, How to Play","Stocks to be bullish on during a Trump term:

Oil: $XOP, $XOM, $SHEL, $MRO

C*****: $COIN, $MARA, $WULF

Big Bois - Apple: $MSFT, $NVDA, $AMZN etc

Military: $BA, $LMT, $RTX

Prison: CoreCivic ($CXW)

Sectors to be bearish on during a Trump term:

All renewable energy (except maybe nuclear)

Agriculture: immigrants make up significant amount of (cheap) labor for the sector

International shipping: tariffs and isolationist policy would be bad

Auto-manufacturing: parts coming from overseas will have tariffs

Low cost foreign retail like Shein and Temu equivalents will get hit hard by tariffs

⚠️Increased Volatility: Awaiting Action⚠️

Cannabis: Republicans have historically been tough on marijuana. It seemed like things would be par for the course once again until Trump said on Truth Social that he would be voting in favor of Amendment 3 in Florida which would make it completely legal for adults 21 and up. I suspect this was a grift, but he’s such a wildcard that maybe he really would go against the conservative grain.

$APPL: While I left it out of the Big Bois due to the China taxes being a bearish variable, I think it should still hold strong in the long term.  We’ll see

$TSM probably has the widest range of outcomes in the market imo. 
If Trump’s attitude toward China is legit-

Best Pro: $TSM sees increased demand from U.S. and allies who want to bypass China’s questionable supply chain.

Worst Con: $TSM still makes most of their money from China, who could retaliate in a number of ways

Least worst con: $TSM is still intertwined with China’s cheaper supply chain. A western supply chain would be more expensive and be time consuming to adopt.

Don’t even want to consider it possible, but anything less diplomatic than economic warfare with China would be drastic not only for $TSM but for the people of Taiwan, god forbid.

$DJT + $TSLA: boy oh boy🤢
Ironically, both of these companies are suffering from the same problem and are presenting the same solution.

Problem: half decent product, lacking a reliable consumer base

Solution: present people with a charismatic rich guy in hopes they will buy/use the product off of pure Ethos alone. 

Neither of these share prices move on fundamentals, but there will come a day when the market finally recognizes them as a social media app and car company respectively. I imagine it won’t be pretty if their fundamentals aren’t fixed by then.",13,57,1730900752.0,2024-11-06T13:45:52+00:00,t3_1gkyuh7,StockMarket
43,TSM,Which Earning Reports Have Impressed You?,"For quick example, Google crushed it, TSM crushed it, PLTR crushed it, META crushed it, RDDT crushed it.

108,TSM,Why I think TSM/INTC will outpace NVDA/AMD growth in the next decade. ,"Tech giants like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Meta are spending billions of CapEx on AI. Lets just look at their last 2 quarters spending:

* **Amazon**: Increased CapEx from $60 billion in Q2 2024 to $70 billion in Q3 2024.
* **Google**: Increased CapEx from $44 billion to $49 billion in the same period.
* **Microsoft**: Increased CapEx from $44 billion to $49 billion.
* **Meta**: Increased CapEx from $29 billion to $31 billion.

However not all that CapEx is going to third party AI solutions like Nvidia/AMD. Each and every company listed above has or is developing it's own custom AI silicon.

Lets look how they are transitioning from 3rd party to In-House AI silicon:

**Amazon**: Developed AWS Inferentia and Tranium chips for AI processing (manufactured by TSM &amp; INTC).

**Google**: Developed Tensor Processing Unite (TPU) and Axion chip for AI processing (manufactured by TSM).

**Microsoft**: Developed Azure Maia AI chip and Azure Cobalt for AI processing (manufactured by TSM &amp; INTC).

**Meta**: Developed Meta trading and Inference Accelerator (MTIA) for AI processing (manufactured by TSM).

All those developments reduce dependence on external GPU suppliers, allow more customized/efficient AI processing and most importantly huge cost savings.

Just to understand the level of savings (and why would they invest huge R&amp;D budget on this):

A **regular Nvidia H100 GPU**, cost approximately **$3,320** to manufacture from TSMC. However it is being sold at **$25,000 to $30,000** each!

That's almost 800%-900% profit margins that has to be paid by the companies above, when they opt not to choose In-House Silicon.

As more of the AI CapEx goes to custom silicon (will never be 100%, but expect that percentage only to grow larger over time, driven by cost savings)  TSMC and Intel foundries will benefit directly from this trend (both have EUV capabilities, INTC will mass produce 18A EUV chips next year, with Amazon as first client)

And this will position TSMC and INTC for substantial growth, because **the rate limiting factor for AI growth will be how much silicon can TSMC or INTC manufacture** for the entire world's AI demand.

116,TSM,baby’s first year trading options with prideful 250%+ YTD - AMA or roast me.,"This got removed in options for being too noob so here I am with you fellow regards.

I started trading options in March and smashed my previous ATH this week 🎉 
I’ll summarize the last 6-12 months:
For most of 2022-2023 across three accounts, both taxable and IRAs, I had been middling around 15k and not doing very well trading. In the last 6 months since I started options, I’m up over 125% with only about $200 a month deposited. I’m also up 250% YTD and 340% the past 12 months, but those include a max Roth IRA $6500 contribution. It was a pretty good time to start playing semi/AI tech, and then space startups, but of course I wish I got in sooner! 

My biggest successes have been with AAPL, TSM, and NVDA of course, then ASTS, RKLB, LUNR. 
Lost on SOFI and DKNG while getting my feet wet, then played a series of TSM calls for big wins. I needed those wins to afford any NVDA options 😂 
Had another big loss with MU, some on HIMS (I hate the stock). Have a little in OKLO shares but super pissed I didn’t grab some calls in the last few months.

*I’ll post more in comments if people ask.* I did not have a disciplined strategy, just some loose principles putting guardrails on my emotional gambling mindset (vibe check sigma grindset).

&amp;#x200B;

*Global chip stocks fell on Wednesday, after Dutch semiconductor equipment maker ASML posted disappointing sales forecasts, driving down global stocks in the sector.Shares of ASML extended losses into the second day at the start of the European trading session, down 5%. The company’s stock dropped 16% Tuesday, losing 49.2 billion euros ($53.6 billion) from its market capitalization in a single day, according to CNBC calculations.ASML’s decline also dragged other European semiconductor firms in the red on Wednesday. ASMI — a Netherlands-based firm that supplies wafer processing equipment for the semiconductor manufacturing industry — fell 2.3%. Compatriot chip equipment maker BE Semionductor dropped 1.9%.Dutch-listed semiconductor firm STMicroelectronics lost 1.2%, while German chipmaker Infineon shed 1.1%. Soitec, French semiconductor materials manufacturer, fell 0.9%*

&amp;#x200B;

*Asian declines*

&amp;#x200B;

*In Asia, meanwhile, shares of Japanese semiconductor manufacturing firm Tokyo Electron logged the biggest loses, dropping nearly 10%. Renesas Electronics fell over 3%, and Advantest, a testing equipment supplier dipped 0.8%.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Hon Hai Precision Industry — known internationally as Foxconn — fell as much as 3.3% and 1.6, respectively.South Korean chipmaking heavyweight SK Hynix, which manufactures high bandwidth memory chips for AI applications for Nvidia, traded 1.6% lower. While Samsung Electronics, the world’s largest maker for dynamic random-access memory chips, saw its shares drop 1.9%.Losses in the region’s semiconductor sector also dragged down major indexes. Japan’s Nikkei 225 lost more than 2%, South Korea’s Kospi dipped 0.6% and the Taiwan Weighted Index slid 0.7%.*

&amp;#x200B;

*ASML reports early*

&amp;#x200B;

*In a report on Tuesday, ASML, which is based in Veldhoven, Netherlands, said it expects net sales for 2025 to come in between 30 billion euros and 35 billion euros ($32.7 billion and $38.1 billion), at the lower half of the range it had previously provided.Net bookings for the September quarter were 2.6 billion euros ($2.83 billion), the company said — well below the 5.6 billion euro LSEG consensus estimate. Net sales, however, beat expectations coming in at 7.5 billion euros.The company’s CEO warned of cautiousness among customers and said a “recovery is more gradual than previously expected.”After ASML tanked 16%, other global chipmakers plunged. Nvidia fell 4.7% and AMD lost 5.2%.Also on Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that that Biden administration officials had discussed limiting sales of advanced AI clips from Nvidia to certain countries in the interest of national security, further dampening investor sentiment around the semiconductor sector.ASML has faced a tougher business outlook in China due to U.S. and Dutch export restrictions on its shipments.CFO Roger Dassen said Tuesday that he expects the company’s China business to show a “more normalized percentage in our order book and also in our business.”“So we expect China to come in at around 20% of our total revenue for next year,” he said. In its June-quarter earnings presentation, ASML said that 49% of its sales come from China.ASML’s business in Asia is likely to face continued headwinds, Eugene, Hsiao, head of China equity strategy at Macquarie Capital, said on CNBC’s “Squawk Box Asia” on Wednesday.While “it makes a lot of sense” for ASML to continue working with China from the “economic perspective”, he said, there are “broader issues between governments going into economic problems.”*",10,10,1729095356.0,2024-10-16T16:15:56+00:00,t3_1g538dr,stocks

46,TSM,TSMC's revenue for September surged 39.6% YoY,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) revenue for September surged 39.6% year-over-year to about NT$251.87B amid growing demand for artificial intelligence chips for use in AI products.

TSM — which produces chips for some of the world's largest tech companies including Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) — saw September-quarter revenue of NT$759.69B (adding revenues for July NT$256.95B, August NT$250.87B and September NT$251.87B) (about $23.6B).

The average analyst forecast is NT$748B, according to a report by Bloomberg News.

While announcing its second quarter results in July, TSM said it expected third quarter revenue to be between $22.4B and $23.2B (midpoint of $22.8B). For the third quarter, the company expected its business to be helped by strong smartphone and AI-related demand for its leading-edge process technologies.

Month-over-month TSM's revenue rose 0.4% as it had generated NT$250.87B in revenue in August.

TSM is slated to report its third quarter results on Oct. 17.",97,26,1728466344.0,2024-10-09T09:32:24+00:00,t3_1fznfk0,stocks
117,TSM,What Would Take to Rattle The Market.,"The question is why would the market sell-off? There's election, good jobs data, rate cuts so need negative news catalyst recently was ""*August 7th Israel Anniversary Response*"".

As long as election and rate cuts are in play, it'll take a change in sentiment. Hot CPI could change the tone, extensive hurricane damage, Israel responds, and Oct. 3rd quarter weakness sell-off.

If the market is going to rattle it'll take:

1. Hot CPI coming in on the 10th
2. Devastating hurricane damage reports 11th-15th
3. IL responding sometime this month with unexpected force
4. 3rd quarter weakness sell-off which didn't take place in Sept.

This is the bear case. Doesn't mean any of this will happen!

CPI comes in showing more cooling, hurricane is overlooked, IL doesn't respond this month, leads to a really weak 3rd quarter weakness sell-off *if any at all*. The elections, rate cuts and earning's seasons just about to start are such a powerful catalyst imo. Many very profitable companies last season trading flat or declining a bit, this season could be when they run like TSM/Amazon breaking $200.",5,17,1728448480.0,2024-10-09T04:34:40+00:00,t3_1fzjgoo,wallstreetbets
118,TSM,Long-time $AMD Holder (Cost Basis $19.04) Starting to Sell - Anyone Else Disappointed in the Stock in 2024?,"Wrote about my thinking below...

Out of the [31 large banks](https://www.tipranks.com/news/amd-or-intel-bank-of-america-selects-the-top-chip-stock-to-buy), 25 have a “buy” rating and 6 have a “hold” rating on [AMD 0.29%↑](https://substack.com/discover/stocks/AMD). It’s hard to think about why to sell when everyone is telling you to buy, but I am of the opinion that is when it should be most deeply considered.

[image credit to tipranks.com](https://preview.redd.it/1zoewsmjretd1.png?width=1209&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=685bc6d7418ed25a4dbc0fb2000f37213bd7d728)

AMD has been my most profitable investment of the past 5 years, having risen 800% since purchased in August of 2018. For most investors (including myself), it’s difficult to part with winners. Not only that, I am someone who believes AI will proliferate throughout society in the coming years. Because they design data center GPUs, AMD should be one of the primary beneficiaries as the AI boom continues. It might seem counter-intuitive then to sell the stock here, but that is what I’ve begun doing over the past two weeks.

https://preview.redd.it/1mrdxxmcsetd1.jpg?width=1582&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99dacab7094cfcdf83b92c7aeb6bccb4cb712d0b

I had high hopes for AMD this year, but it’s my view that they've failed to take significant data center GPU market share from Nvidia, and will have increased competition from Intel's new product offerings (on both [client](https://youtu.be/QB1u4mjpBQI?si=aO3PiV0MPfbaneGQ) and [data center](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h0wBn2L-FU)), as well as [proprietary silicon](https://aws.amazon.com/silicon-innovation/) from large cloud players (Google, Amazon, etc). My original thesis was that AMD would profit from overextended Nvidia margins in 2024, but this underestimated the CUDA ecosystem moat that existed with Nvidia data center products (see [Why I Got Nvidia Wrong](https://dragdeninvest.substack.com/p/why-i-got-nvidia-wrong)). While most large cloud players want to diversify at least somewhat from Nvidia, they are still unable to do so without risking a competitive advantage with their own AI offerings. Add Intel into the mix, and the margin and market share pressure will be on AMD. The only player in the silicon value chain I think which can currently raise margins is TSMC ([TSM 2.61%↑](https://substack.com/discover/stocks/TSM)), but the geopolitical risk is too high for me to continue holding the stock (I sold my TSMC stake two weeks ago).

On the PC (personal computer), Nvidia has always had a strong moat. It’s not just because they have the best performing products, but also because game developers are economically incentivized to optimize first (and often only) for the largest potential audience. This is similar to the moat CUDA protects on the data center side. One might think that Nvidia charging incredibly high prices for discrete graphics cards would cause them to lose share to AMD with consumers who directly purchase the products (as opposed to businesses who purchase the data center products). Yet Nvidia market share has only grown over the past few years.

**Why This Take Could Be Wrong:**  
There is a lot of bullish momentum in the investor community around AMD currently from both professional commentators and retail investors (e.g. Twitter / X). Many people who had never heard of AMD 5 years ago are now saying to put money into the stock as it is Nvidia’s only pure AI competitor. As a result of this, AMD could see a dramatic rise on a positive earnings report later this month. In addition, I expect gaming revenues to surprise to the upside with the minor refresh of Xbox and Playstation consoles coming for holiday season. I still have \~260 shares of AMD remaining, and will likely hold to see if the stock jumps on the report. I think that AMD is extremely stretched in its current valuation (P/E of 205), and that any bad news could send it spiralling. Selling half of the remaining stake now is essentially a hedge against this possibility. Whatever happens with the earnings report, I will likely reduce my AMD holdings to zero in the next few months as I continue to lower exposure to companies [reliant on Taiwan](https://substack.com/@dragdeninvest/p-138866297).",1,8,1728339309.0,2024-10-07T22:15:09+00:00,t3_1fykaa3,wallstreetbets

120,TSM,"Helene Destroys Spruce Pine, NC Ultra-Pure Quartz Mining Operation. Short NVDA?","There is a location in North Carolina that produces essentially the global supply of ultra pure quartz. The quartz is needed for czochralski crucibles, don't ask me what that means, I don't know. These are essential for the production of basically every type of semiconductor. See this article: https://www.wired.com/story/book-excerpt-science-of-ultra-pure-silicon/

The company, Unimin (parent company - Sibelco) has it's main production facility in Spruce Pine, North Carolina. Rumors indicate that the town has been wiped off the face of the Earth. https://x.com/FossilLocator/status/1840218595541778791

Production has been hauled for the foreseeable future. There are some alternative methods to produce this material, but people are saying that this accounts for over 90% of the world's supply and this material is critical. The backup company in the US is The Quartz Company, which is also located in Spruce Pine, and is probably also gone too.

I am trying to figure out who would be screwed the most from this. I'm sure it's a gamble, but some of the big semiconductor companies are going to be railed with no more supply of their fine powder. Thoughts on who to short?
I'm thinking NVDA, TSM, AVGO, AMD, TXN, QCOM.

Sibelco has their mine at 35°53'52""N 82°03'40""W, which is like 800m above sea level, so that's probably fine minus road damage from falling trees.

Quartz Co has an operation on the river 35°55'37""N 82°05'36""W with a ton of equipment (presumably railroad shipping) that sits below 765m. Safe to say that area has been underwater.

1. The IV in long legs needs to be under 60%, buying further out in time reduces IV but raises cost so need to shop around looking for the least amount of IV to cost ratio, for ADBE is two weeks out *see IV example.*
2. Company must report Thursday after-hours so IV crush &amp; expiration completely decay the short legs, any would-be leftover premium works against the position so ER's happening sooner in the week work much less effectively. We want to crush the disproportionate IV entirely in one day.
3. Absolutely needs to have open interest/volume.

**IV** **EXAMPLE:** ADBE's following week of earning's has 58% IV, 2nd week 48% IV, 3rd week 45% IV. I'd choose the 2nd week out, paying just a little more to avoid most of the IV crush. The 3rd week offers just slight reduction of IV for a much bigger jump in cost so it's a pass.

**CONCLUSION:** There's only select amount of companies which meet this criteria, the trade is only possible on earning's, so this very much requires waiting for a set-up. The returns are about 130%-200% of the original debt paid. It's basically waiting for a Mag 7, TSM, ADBE, AVGO, etc.. type of company to report because otherwise the criteria will not be met, the move becomes harder to size and the IV crush becomes lethal. This is my strategy for earning's which think gives me an edge.",34,26,1726026338.0,2024-09-11T03:45:38+00:00,t3_1fe10lp,options

251,TSM,Apple Unveils iPhone 16 Pro: A New Chapter in Mobile Technology,"Apple has introduced the iPhone 16 Pro at its highly anticipated event, adding another chapter to its legacy of innovation in the smartphone market.

The latest iteration in the iPhone lineup brings significant upgrades in both hardware and software, aiming to cement Apple's position as the leader in mobile technology.



Key Features of the iPhone 16 Pro

The iPhone 16 Pro is set to offer an array of enhanced features, most notably its new A18 Pro chip built on 3 nm technology, designed in collaboration with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), Qualcomm (QCOM), and Arm Holdings (ARMH).

This chip represents a substantial leap in processing power, particularly for gaming and high-performance applications.

One of the standout features of the A18 Pro chip is a 30% improvement in gaming performance. This advancement is expected to provide a smoother and more immersive gaming experience, bolstered by a GPU that runs 20% faster than previous models.

Tencent's (TCEHY) popular game, Honor of Kings World, will be among the first to take advantage of this enhanced gaming capability on the iPhone 16.

The iPhone 16 Pro will be available in two display sizes: 6.3 inches and 6.9 inches.

Both models will come equipped with a 48MP fusion camera capable of shooting 4K video at 120 frames per second, a substantial improvement over previous iterations. This upgrade is likely to attract photography enthusiasts and professionals alike, as it provides a significant boost in video and image quality.

Battery life has also been enhanced, addressing a critical pain point for many iPhone users.

Apple has not specified the exact improvement in battery life, but this feature will likely be a key selling point for users who require longer usage without frequent charging.

The pricing strategy remains consistent with Apple's premium positioning. The iPhone 16 will start at $999, while the iPhone 16 Pro will start at $1,199. The models will be available for purchase starting September 20.



Market Impact and Strategic Implications

The introduction of the iPhone 16 Pro comes at a crucial time for Apple as it faces increasing competition from rivals like Samsung and Huawei.

The latter has already made waves in the smartphone market with its innovative tri-fold phone, which has garnered over three million pre-orders, underscoring a shift in consumer preferences towards more unique and versatile designs.

Apple's decision to continue with its traditional iPhone design, rather than exploring foldable options, may be seen as a conservative move in the eyes of some investors and tech enthusiasts.

However, the company is betting that the combination of its new A18 Pro chip, advanced camera features, and enhanced gaming capabilities will provide a compelling enough proposition for consumers to upgrade.

The pricing of the new models also reflects Apple's confidence in its product lineup and its ability to command premium prices.

While there is always a risk that high prices could deter some potential buyers, Apple has consistently demonstrated its ability to maintain strong margins while driving demand among its loyal customer base.



Opportunities for Suppliers and Partners

The iPhone 16 Pro’s advanced technology is likely to benefit several key suppliers and partners. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Qualcomm, both instrumental in the development of the A18 Pro chip, stand to gain from Apple's continued focus on high-performance hardware.

Arm Holdings (ARMH), which provides critical architecture for the chip, will also see a boost from the increased demand for high-end smartphones featuring its technology.

Game developers and publishers like Tencent (TCEHY), Electronic Arts (EA), Microsoft (MSFT), and Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) will also benefit from the enhanced gaming capabilities of the iPhone 16 Pro.

The new hardware opens up possibilities for more sophisticated mobile games, potentially driving increased user engagement and revenue.



Challenges and Competitive Landscape

Despite the strong feature set of the iPhone 16 Pro, Apple must navigate a complex competitive landscape. The smartphone market is becoming increasingly saturated, with major players like Samsung and Huawei continuing to innovate with foldable screens and unique form factors.

This evolution could attract a segment of consumers looking for something different, potentially impacting iPhone sales.

Furthermore, the entry-level price point of $999 for the iPhone 16 may pose a challenge in price-sensitive markets. While Apple's premium brand allows for higher pricing, it must balance this with the need to drive volume, especially in regions where Android devices dominate.

261,TSM,[Bloomberg] TSMC’s Arizona Trials Put Plant Productivity on Par with Taiwan,"&gt; Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. achieved production yields at its Arizona facility on par with established plants back home, an early indicator that its marquee US project is on track to achieve its targets.

&gt; The Taiwanese chipmaker’s yield rate in trial production at its first advanced US plant is similar to comparable facilities in the southern Taiwanese city of Tainan, according to a person familiar with the company, who asked not to be identified discussing private corporate matters. TSMC had said it started engineering wafer production in April with advanced 4-nanometer process technology.

&gt; Yield rate, or how many usable chips a company can produce during a single manufacturing process, is a key factor that impacts profitability. While TSMC doesn’t disclose its yield rate, investors are counting on the company’s ability to maintain steady margins. The company has said it can maintain gross margin rates at 53% or higher in the long run, and has kept its net profit steady at above 36% over the past four years.

&gt; TSMC said in an email that its Arizona project is “proceeding as planned with good progression,” without commenting on the yield.

&gt; The go-to chipmaker for Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp. originally planned to have its first Arizona plant start full production in 2024, but pushed back the target to 2025 due to a lack of skilled workers. The delay fueled concerns that the company might not be able to make chips in the US as efficiently as in Taiwan.

&gt; The US plans to award TSMC $6.6 billion in grants and as much as $5 billion in loans to support the chipmaker’s $65 billion in investments at three plants in Arizona.

23,TSM,Properly Using Double Calendars &amp; Diagonals Through Earnings.,"This is imo one of the most challenging options plays to pull off, but one of the most cost-effective and rewarding on short term timeframe if done correctly. It's playing earning's using diagonal spreads; or horizonal spreads if using calendars.

There are 3 variations selling further OTM aka double diagonal, selling the same strike aka double calendar, or selling closer ITM aka iron condor (because difference in dates it's a *diagonal iron condor*).

Pros &amp; Cons to 3 Variations:

1. **Double diagonal:** will provide least amount of premium, but will create difference in intrinsic value so if strikes are blown out will still be able to close for profit. The problem is one side is always losing so this increases initial costs by substantial amount.
2. **Double Calendar**: will have a breakeven point on either side unlike the double diagonal because the intrinsic values are identical when buying and selling the same strike. You receive more premium helping offset losing side and face no spread loss but if a strike is blown out the entire structure will lose.
3. **Double Diagonal Iron Condor:** will sell the strikes closer than the buy providing most amount of premium possible, offsetting the losing side greatly but creating potential spread loss on winning side. The breakevens are even closer now, putting entire structure at a loss faster due to spread loss. 

**Prior Results**: For 3 weeks in a row, went 11/11 earning's correctly predicting almost to the dollar the earning's implied move. The fourth week went 8/16 earning's, I could not understand why or what went wrong.

My solution was to add more time to the long legs, suspecting the IV crush was destroying my profit in the long legs. Initially, was selling week of earning's and buying following week. So started buying the 2nd week out instead of the following, this progressed to going as far as a month out to keep reducing IV in long legs. It worked, on some companies.

Again, was back to where I was, not able to understand why this was failing me now this time if had created solution to the problem by adding more time.

**The Solution**: By going further out in time, I was offsetting IV crush but increasing the dollar amount invested in the losing side, which would in return cause greater losses as direction moved against. I was selling disproportionate IV (selling 150%+ in short legs, buying 60% in long legs), but my spread had disproportionate amount of time difference, selling just a day and buying a month out counteracting each other.

I've finally figured out what's been going wrong. When I went 11/11, was playing big companies like TSM, Mag 7, but the week went 8/16 was playing companies like CVS, Monster, Airbnb. Buying more time isn't the solution, going further out in time just raises costs on losing side greatly and if strikes are blown out, the solution is buying companies with right IV environment to begin with.

**CONCLUSION**: Opening calendars on earning's, the most important factor is the company itself. Large big Mag 7 companies will have far more accurate suggested implied moves, and more importantly will have much lower IV in the following week. This allows buying long legs for cheap cost, not requiring going further out in time to avoid IV crush, because they have much lower IV to begin with than smaller high beta companies like Monster and Airbnb. So this strategy can only be played if long legs of the following week are not drastically spiking in IV, cause going further out in time is not the solution.",5,12,1725579290.0,2024-09-05T23:34:50+00:00,t3_1fa0wqv,options
59,TSM,Air Canada Shares Decline Amidst CEO’s Concerns Over Stock Performance,"* ***Air Canada’s stock may be trading below its true value due to external pressures, similar to TSM and Element79.***
* ***Despite challenges, Air Canada plans to increase capacity and is considering a stock buyback to enhance shareholder value.***
* ***With a robust balance sheet and long-term potential, Air Canada remains well-positioned for future growth.***

Air Canada (AC.TO) shares experienced a decline on Wednesday as the airline’s CEO expressed dissatisfaction with the stock’s recent performance. The Montreal-based airline released its second-quarter financial results, which aligned with the lower guidance it had issued last month. The company reported a net income of $410 million, a significant drop from the $838 million recorded a year earlier. The decrease was attributed to increased competition on international routes and rising jet fuel costs.

**Stock Price and Market Reactions**

Following the earnings report, Air Canada’s shares closed 1.39 percent lower at $14.93, after dipping as much as 2.5 percent during the trading session. Over the past 12 months, the stock has seen a 34 percent decline, with a 19 percent drop year-to-date.

Michael Rousseau, Air Canada’s CEO, voiced his disappointment with the stock’s performance during a post-earnings conference call. He noted that despite the airline’s record-breaking year in 2023 and a fully repaired balance sheet, the stock has struggled. Rousseau acknowledged that many local airline stocks are facing similar challenges.

https://preview.redd.it/awck44y2ktmd1.jpg?width=1168&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9601b8c571ec7b5230e2c468cee247b9b4dd5085

**Revenue and Operating Capacity**

Air Canada’s second-quarter revenue showed a slight increase to $5.52 billion, up from $5.43 billion the previous year. This growth was supported by a 6.5 percent rise in the airline’s overall operating capacity. However, a key industry metric, passenger revenue per available seat mile, declined by 4.4 percent year-over-year. Rousseau warned that this trend is expected to continue into the third quarter of 2024, with Canadian airport fees likely to impact the company’s performance for years to come.

Despite these challenges, Air Canada plans to increase its available seat mile capacity in the third quarter by 4 to 4.5 percent compared to the same period in 2023. The company had previously adjusted its profit forecast due to anticipated lower load factors and increased international competition.

When asked about the potential impact of financial pressures on Canadian households, Mark Galardo, vice-president of revenue and network planning, stated that there has been “no real slowdown” in consumer demand.

Analysts also inquired whether Air Canada would consider repurchasing its shares, given the recent decline in stock price. Rousseau indicated that the company is focused on balancing growth and rewarding shareholders, suggesting that a stock buyback is a high priority.

**Market Perception and Fair Valuation: Insights from TSM and Element79**

Sometimes, a company’s stock price does not accurately reflect its true value, often due to external factors and market sentiment. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) serves as a prime example. Despite its robust financials and leadership in the semiconductor industry, TSM’s stock has experienced volatility due to geopolitical tensions between China and Taiwan. The fear of potential conflicts and disruptions in the global supply chain has driven fluctuations in TSM’s stock price, causing it to trade below its intrinsic value at times.

https://preview.redd.it/o9tq4x75ktmd1.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d8cf2e581e64a35bd82136cf946b82adc260abf1

Similarly, Air Canada’s stock may be undervalued due to external pressures such as rising fuel costs, regulatory changes, and heightened competition. However, these factors do not necessarily diminish the company’s long-term potential, which remains solid thanks to strategic initiatives and a strong balance sheet. This scenario is reminiscent of Element79, a company in the mining sector that is currently trading at a price that many consider cheap relative to its underlying assets and growth prospects. Element79 (CSE:ELEM, much like Air Canada, is affected by external factors such as market sentiment and broader economic conditions, which can lead to temporary mispricing. Investors who recognize this discrepancy between market price and intrinsic value may see an opportunity to invest at a discount, with the potential for significant returns as the market corrects itself.

**Conclusion**

Air Canada faces a challenging market environment, reflected in its declining stock price and the pressures of rising costs and competition. However, the company remains committed to growth, with plans to expand capacity and a potential stock buyback on the horizon. With its strong balance sheet and strategic focus, Air Canada is positioned to navigate these challenges while seeking opportunities to enhance shareholder value. For investors, the current valuation may represent an attractive entry point, much like opportunities seen in TSM and Element79, where stocks may trade below their fair value due to external factors. As the market stabilizes, there is potential for these stocks to realign with their intrinsic value, offering significant upside for those who invest wisely.",6,1,1725467319.0,2024-09-04T16:28:39+00:00,t3_1f8xp9i,SmallStreetBets

10,TSM,INTC - Acquisition Potential?,"It looks like pieces of Intel are being sold or spun off.

Would be very surprised if one of the other big chip makers didn't buy those pieces.

  
[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-intel-ceo-pitch-board-194933608.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-intel-ceo-pitch-board-194933608.html)

  
The proposal does not yet include plans to split Intel and sell off its contract manufacturing operation, or foundry, to a buyer such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. ([TSM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSM), [2330.TW](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/2330.TW)), according to the source and another person familiar with the matter.

The presentation, including the plans around its manufacturing operations, are not yet finalized and could change ahead of the meeting.

Intel has already broken off its foundry business from its design business, and has been reporting its financial results separately since the first calendar quarter of this year.

The company has erected a wall between the design and manufacturing businesses to assure that potential customers of the design division would have no access to technology secrets of customers using Intel’s factories, known as fabs, to manufacture their chips.

Intel is suffering through one of its worst periods as it attempts to play catchup in the AI era against the likes of Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA)), the dominant AI chipmaker with a $3 trillion market capitalization.

262,TSM,Intel board member quit after differences over chipmaker's revival plan,"The sudden resignation of a high-profile Intel board member came after differences with CEO Pat Gelsinger and other directors over what the director considered the U.S. company's bloated workforce, risk-averse culture and lagging artificial intelligence strategy, according to three sources familiar with the matter.

Lip-Bu Tan, a semiconductor industry veteran, had said he was leaving the board because of a personal decision to ""reprioritize various commitments"" and that he remained ""supportive of the company and its important work,"" in a regulatory filing on Thursday.

The former CEO of chip-software company Cadence Design joined Intel's board two years ago as part of a plan to restore Intel's place as the leading global chipmaker. The board expanded Tan's responsibilities in October 2023, authorizing him to oversee manufacturing operations.

Over time, Tan grew frustrated by the company's large workforce, its approach to contract manufacturing and Intel's risk-averse and bureaucratic culture, according to the sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly. 

The circumstances around Tan's exit have not previously been reported. The departure of the industry veteran, who is well-regarded by investors, over Intel's strategy illustrates the uncertainty of its turnaround efforts.

Tan leaves as the company endures one of the bleakest periods in its five-decade history that has left it vulnerable to a potential activist shareholder attack, former executives said. Intel has hired investment bank Morgan Stanley to prepare a defense, according to sources familiar with the matter, confirming an earlier report.

Intel, headquartered in California, declined to comment. Tan's venture capital firm, Walden Catalyst, did not respond to a request for comment.

Tan's exit leaves a vacuum of chip-industry technical and business acumen on the board, which is populated by leaders in academia and finance, and former senior executives from the medical, tech and aerospace industries, say investors and semiconductor industry insiders.

Former Intel executives told Reuters the company began preparing for a potential activist threat months ago. Reuters could not independently confirm if any shareholders were preparing an approach.

This month, Intel paused its dividend that it had been paying for decades when it reported results and plans to reduce capital spending on factory construction. The next day, investors wiped more than $30 billion from its market value, or more than a quarter of its worth.

Intel's struggles are occurring against the backdrop of aggressive investment and sales from rivals swept up by the surge of interest in artificial intelligence. The AI boom turned graphics chipmaker Nvidia into a $3-trillion market-cap company. Intel passed on an opportunity in 2018 to take as much as a 30% stake in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, Reuters previously reported.

Intel acquired at least two AI startups, among more than four efforts since 2010 to build a blockbuster AI chip, according to former executives. Even though its Habana acquisition yielded promising AI chips, its senior leaders left to form a rival effort in Israel, hurting Intel's program, two sources said.

To cut costs, Intel announced in August layoffs of more than 15% of its workforce, its second round of cuts in two years. Intel had nearly 125,300 employees globally according to its August financial results.

The layoff plan was one source of tension between Tan and the board, according to sources. Tan wanted specific cuts, including middle managers who do not contribute to Intel's engineering efforts.

Gelsinger, who took over in 2021 as part of a turnaround plan, added at least 20,000 employees to Intel's payroll by 2022.

To Tan and some former Intel executives, the workforce appeared bloated. Teams on some projects were as much as five times larger than others doing comparable work at rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices, according to two sources. One former executive said Intel should have cut double the number it announced in August years ago.

Tan has told people he believed Intel was overrun by bureaucratic layers of middle managers who impeded progress at Intel's server and desktop chips divisions and the cuts should have focused on these people.

Intel's workforce, which is larger than those of Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co combined, has led to a complacent and uncompetitive culture, far from the ""only-the-paranoid-survive"" ethos of Intel co-founder Andy Grove, former Intel executives said.

Intel's turnaround plan relies on building its foundry business, which helps other companies manufacture chips, similar to TSMC. But the company has not disclosed a big customer and has said the business is not expected to turn a profit until 2027.

An attempt last year to break into contract-manufacturing through a $5.4-billion purchase of Israel-based chip manufacturer Tower Semiconductor was scuttled after China blocked the deal. Intel would have obtained an organization dedicated to contract chipmaking, something Intel has never done successfully.

Without Tower, Intel, historically a maker of its own chips, lacks the expertise to work with external customers, which it has struggled to attract, according to four sources familiar with Intel's manufacturing business.

Tan grew frustrated as the board did not follow his recommendations over how to make the manufacturing business more customer-centric and to remove unnecessary bureaucracy, a person close to Tan said.

Intel has continued to build new factories in Ohio, Arizona and across Europe without naming new customers.

Greetings regards, it has been many months since my last play; TSM and that play costed me a great amount but back then I started off by playing with options on based on how I felt and I was right for 2 weeks straight until I started getting technical and before I knew it I lost my $30,000 gain and lost around $10,000 of my own money. As a 18 year old that just graduated I can definitely afford to risk some more money as my family financials are good enough for me to live off of. Now ever since my TSM play from March I've started to watch more stock news and economic news and slowly saved up money from my fast food job, hell I didn't even really know who daddy Powell was until TSM almost completely wiped out my portfolio. Now March was unlucky for me because of uncertainty with rate cuts and inflation rising which meant stocks would go down. However, we just came out of a big dip and daddy Powell has confirmed cuts and the economy is looking bullish as hell which leads to me my 2nd biggest play of 2024.

123,TSM,Opinion: move to machinery/metrology sector of microchips to avoid bubble/correction threat ,"As new chips tech is constantly being developed like Nvidia Blackwell (200 billion transistors) and Amd Zen5 (8billion transistors) there’s upside to be had in the machinery sector, particularly smaller companies with dominance in memory (CAMT), and gate all around packaging (NVMI). Nova supplies every top ten chip manufacturer and has new gen machines being tested by top chip companies, mainly TSM, Intel, Nvidia, amd. CAMT has fewer top customers and high growth potential if they get one.  Both small companies entirely vital to all chip production but getting little to no mainstream attention. They both always beat earnings estimates.

263,TSM,TSMC sales grow 45% in July on strong AI chip demand,"(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s revenue rose 45% in July, accelerating its pace of growth from the June quarter and bolstering hopes for sustained strong demand for artificial intelligence chips from the likes of Nvidia Corp.

Sales for the month reached NT$256.95 billion ($7.9 billion). For the third quarter, analysts project TSMC revenue should grow 37% to NT$747.4 billion, with the July result suggesting TSMC may surpass those expectations.

Taiwan’s biggest company is one of the key bellwethers for AI demand, as the go-to chipmaker for leading accelerator makers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. It’s also the sole supplier of processors for Apple Inc.’s iPhones, at a time the mobile device market is showing signs of bouncing off post-Covid era lows. Last month, the world’s largest contract chipmaker raised its full-year growth outlook to beyond the maximum mid-20% it had guided toward previously.

TSMC offered an upbeat assessment of its business and prospects when it last reported earnings, with Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei signaling the company may have room to raise prices as more of its customers transition to its most advanced technology and have to compete for limited capacity. High-performance computing, led by AI, contributed 52% of TSMC’s revenue last quarter, the first time it has accounted for more than half.

Still, investors have started to question whether the billions of dollars Big Tech firms have invested in the infrastructure to support the AI boom will result in substantial returns, while a potential delay in Nvidia’s development of a new generation of AI chips is spurring concerns over the progress of the emerging technology.

What Bloomberg Intelligence Says

TSMC’s 44.7% year-over-year sales surge, marking its second-highest sales gain in the past 20 months, aligned with our expectations for robust 3Q performance. This surge could indicate sustained, strong AI chip demand and significant 3-nanometer production orders from Apple, Qualcomm, and MediaTek. TSMC is well positioned to beat the top end of its $23.2 billion 3Q sales guidance.

Worries about the global economic outlook over the past week interrupted the AI rally that had seen key players like TSMC gains billions in market value. Investors opted to cash out of some of the year’s biggest gainers, pushing TSMC’s shares down 10% in a day, though the company recovered much of that in subsequent days as money managers saw a good buying opportunity.

I have saved 4K this year and want to buy my first stocks. Now seems like a good time since the correction. A friend of mine that works in finance recommended Nvidia, Dell and TSM. I like the chip stocks and will definitely be buying Nvidia and Dell. Probably TSM as well.  However, I really want to buy Raytheon. With all the recent news it seems like a good idea to invest in the military stocks. Is Raytheon a good buy for long term growth? Or do people just own it for a high dividend? Could you see Raytheon growing more in the next 10 years than any of the Stocks I mentioned.

127,TSM,My theory why buffet sold aapl,"Everyone is freaking out about recession and also citing buffet selling half his stake in aapl as proof. But the reality is buffet doesn't time the market he holds good companies through recessions. But if you look at a lot of his other moves, sold all his TSM and a large portion of BYD as well. Its clear that buffet has geopolitical risks on the top of his mind, aapl would be obliterated in the case of a taiwan war. 

Afterall, why wouldn't he sell his American express position in a material way, wouldn't they get hit hard in a recession as well with delinquencies and decreased consumer spending? 

I guess this post doesn't really offer much reassurance as a taiwan war would be worse than a recession. But honestly I think you should trade like it wouldn't happen because if it does it would probably devolve into nuclear war and currency would be irrelevant at that point.

* Sell network division to Broadcom, so Broadcom completely dominate every aspect of network, including those CPU that are running at the edge.
* Build Intel on top of IFS, and retain x86 license, acting like ARM. And require all three firms (QCOM, NVDA, AVGO) to keep or be the customer of IFS, and move majority of their product to IFS.

After all of these sells, Intel may worth more it is currently because the book value is apparently above the stock price and there is hope for IFS, and Intel shareholder be compensated right. Or

* Trump become the president, increase tariff on those that's built on Taiwan, so Intel and TSM are on the same playing level. Then we can talk",0,32,1722657621.0,2024-08-03T04:00:21+00:00,t3_1eiu09u,wallstreetbets
26,TSM,5/5 Profitable on Every Company Played Earning's,"I've been logging my progress using double calendars each week on the sub. This week I was profitable on every company I played for earning's (ON, Meta, Amzn, Aapl, Dkng). This is not an accident or luck, it's becoming increasingly more consistent as gain more experience with double calendars.

I'm just a hair from 30% on the year, the market has experienced its worst drawdown and am totally unexposed and still profiting it's an amazing and beautiful thing to see.

* Three weeks ago was very profitable with NFLX $650/$715 double calendar and TSM $165/$185/$205 triple calendar. However, bought NVDA shares impulsively at the top, options gains covered the losses cutting even. Vowed to never have undefined risk again. Only traded options since, no shares anymore and won't buy shares unless it's an ETF. Am ready to go deep on SMH after see fear and greed index tank to 20's.
* Two weeks ago was profitable on 3/4 companies played through earning's. Made post detailing the mistake made, bought triple calendar $170 (1), $185 (3), $200 (4) on Google but did not create a neutral structure. There was not enough downside protection, only had (1) put calendar compared to (4) calendars OTM and (3) ATM. Vowed to always play the market neutrally and prepare equally for the downside always.

This week was profitable on every company or 5/5, last week going 3/4 with the Google mistake being something recognized early, but didn't correct and would've been very profitable going 4/4 had bought more put calendars and offset the ATM and OTM call calendars.

This week played (ON $64/$76), (Meta $455/$510), (Apple $205/$217.5/$230), (Amzn $165/$180/$195), (Dkng $32/$40)

Most of the contracts like to close before earning's to secure profit, offset the cost/risk of what I do hold through earning's. I also use the ATM calendar as the new bottom or top if price has moved too aggressively. For example, I had meta $400/$455/$500 originally but the price over few days ran from $455 to $475. So right before earning's I closed the $400/$500. I used the $455 as the floor, opening the $510 as the new top so $455/$510 instead to carry through earning's. Have to adapt.

Imo nobody can become consistently profitable without playing to the upside and downside, this is why neutral structures like double calendars are so effective, more-so during earning's when high IV environment gives massive premiums offsetting the cost of the calls/puts so playing direction on a mulligan. The ultimate Theta play imo.

(Next week have LLY $730/$795/$870, DDOG $90/$125, ELF $135/$185,  - Need companies to report later in the week so can close before earning's, right before expiration, giving Theta time to burn up to the last moment possible, giving the market no time to react to earning's; the following days always dangerous. For example, Meta much harder to play than Amazon, difference of reporting Wednesday close vs. Thursday close. If wanted to be a gambler could hold all my contracts through earning's. but I want to sell and keep what I hold through basically for free from the profit of closing before, which really has cost me profit but am more concerned about averting risk.)",31,28,1722624837.0,2024-08-02T18:53:57+00:00,t3_1eii1ot,options

264,TSM,"Intel heads for worst day on Wall Street in 50 years, falls to lowest in over a decade ","Intel shares plunged the most in 50 years on Friday, reaching a price not seen since 2013, after the chipmaker reported a big earnings miss and announced a massive restructuring.

The stock plummeted 27% to $21.22 as of late morning trading. It would be the second worst day ever for the shares, behind only a 31% drop in July 1974, which was three years after Intel’s IPO. The company’s market cap is now below $100 billion.

The dramatic selloff contributed to a 2.4% drop in the Nasdaq and pulled down global semiconductor stocks. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. — known as TSMC — closed 4.6% lower in Taiwan, and Samsung was down more than 4% at the end of the session in South Korea. TSMC is the world’s biggest manufacturer of chips, while Samsung is the largest memory semiconductor firm globally.

Intel’s numbers were bad across the board.

The company swung to a $1.61 billion net loss after reporting net income of $1.48 billion in the year-earlier period. Adjusted earnings per share of 2 cents fell way short of the average analyst estimate of 10 cents, according to LSEG. Revenue also missed expectations.

Intel said it won’t pay its dividend in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024 and lowered its forecast for full-year capital expenditures by over 20%. The company said it would lay off more than 15% of its employees as part of a $10 billion cost-reduction plan.

“This is the most substantial restructuring of Intel since the memory microprocessor transition four decades ago,” Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger told CNBC’s Jon Fortt in an interview that aired on Friday. “We have laid out an audacious journey of rebuilding this company, and we’re going to get that done.”

A decision to more rapidly produce Core Ultra PC chips that can handle artificial intelligence workloads contributed to the loss, Gelsinger said on a conference call with analysts. The company said pricing was more competitive than planned during the quarter, as AMD, Qualcomm and other companies have been working to take market share from Intel, which has fallen way behind its rivals in the AI battle.

The job cuts will mainly take place this year, Gelsinger wrote in a memo. It’s the largest of any single job cut listed on Layoffs.fyi, an industry tracker that’s been operating since March 2020.

Competing on merit

Adding pressure to the chip sector is a report from The Information that AI chipmaker Nvidia is the subject of a U.S. Department of Justice antitrust investigation.

The DOJ is looking at complaints that the company allegedly abused its market dominance in AI, The Information reported.

In response, a spokesperson for Nvidia said that the company “wins on merit.”

“We compete based on decades of investment and innovation, scrupulously adhering to all laws, making NVIDIA openly available in every cloud and on-prem for every enterprise, and ensuring that customers can choose whatever solution is best for them,” the spokesperson said.

The spokesperson added that Nvidia is “happy to provide any information regulators need.”

CNBC has also reached out to the DOJ on the report.

Samsung rival SK Hynix, which supplies U.S. giant Nvidia, also fell sharply to close more than 10% lower. The sell-off continued in Europe. Shares of ASML, which sells key tools required to make cutting-edge chips, declined along with STMicroelectronics and Infineon.

The VanEck Semiconductor ETF, which includes major names in the sector, fell more than 4% on Friday after plummeting 6.5% a day earlier.

2. Goog barley beat but decline in YT ad could be foreshadowing, now searchGPT competition
3. NFLX adding lots of new customers, improving revenue, net income, and margin beating EPS but price has been very overpriced.
4. MU excellent guidance everything going as planned but was priced for perfection like what else could you say at start of year better than we're sold out 2024, nothing else later in the year would be exciting.
5. FDX cutting costs to improve it's infrastructure which usually gives a big pump for a quarter and then it's right back to failing usually, although some companies turn around but I see AMZN being too competitive.
6. VRT small beat and small raised guidance, still sold off and was very expensive and still kinda pricey for just 18% estimated annualized revenue growth over last 2 years.

131,TSM,My outlook on markets going forward - from a dear regard,"January 2024: market starts to price in anticipated 4-5 rate cuts in 2024. Tech moons. Small/Mid caps stagnant. for the first quarter you could make bank - i made 30k through march and withdrew that shit to pay for my kids school.

April 2024: I am now a reformed bear continuing bull strategy from the first 6 weeks: S\*P drop 5.4% through April 19 - higher than expected inflation date. Push rates higher, lower # of anticipated rate cuts.  I got hammered trying the same call strategy. Gave away 15k if not more.

May 2024: AI AI AI every time you say AI in your earnings call the price goes up $1. S&amp;P up 5.96%

June 2024: News Report: tech doesn't even need a rate cut to continue the bull run. June 12 $AAPL says ""APPLE INTELLIGENCE"", reaches all time highs. (puts for their earnings btw). $NVDA 140% for the year? After last year we were like WTF how is this 300 a share let alone 1400 a share in June.

July 2024 $GOOG $AMZN up \~80-100% for the year.

Look, its logical to take profits. No shame in that especially for retail who loses out 90% of the time.

July 2024: Rate cuts like 99.999% almost certain for sept. Now suddenly Small/Mid caps rally in a massive sector rotation. $SPX/$NDX tanks. Next week:  1T outflows. Then they pump and dump the russel up 12% to 2022 highs and then sell off for a quick 6% while everyones FOMOing into $RUT. Maybe more like RUT RO!!!! I Fomo'd last of dry powder MOnday but after earnings I'm turning bearish.  Tomorrow 5k realized loss for me or hold to 0.

Too hard to beat the street. Profit taking, buying million dollar real estate with cash like smart investors do. Sit on the sidelines and let it bleed. But here we are still FOMO'ing calls and short dated puts that would only print 1/1000 times.

Over the past few days 3 mag 7 earnings all tanked and here we are.

AMD? CPUs Good for gamers and graphics cards for poors. Pennies compared to $NVDA. $NVDA has a monopoly on AI software like $ASML has a monopoly on lithography and $TSM has a monopoly on chip production.  $TSLA obviously seemingly doomed. Google can't take your cookies anymore, advertising revenue down MoM. Wanna get cucked by the zuck?  I'm tempted to donate $1 to people wanting to buy $META calls at this point.

TLDR: This looks like the same pattern we have had in 2022 and 2023 when markets take a downturn through mid-late October.   Look at the previous years. I posted last week about the last 4 septembers being red. It looks like we are in another downturn. Earnings indicates it. I don't think CPI and PCE will save us this week.

How would you play this? 



1) Would you buy a $220 Strike OTM call,

2) Buy a call with a breakeven of $220 ($190 strike for $28, B/E $218),

3) Deep ITM Leaps,

4) Something else.

5) Just buy stocks?

28,TSM,240% Gain NFLX Calendar Last Week,"I really like and probably will only trade from now on calendars, and Strangles overnight 4/5dte for CPI or other very big news related events. Double calendars allow me to take a neutral position, profiting in either direction as long as stay within breakevens.

Last week, NFLX reported on the 18th. I took a position July 10th, double calendar or call calendar $715 and put calendar $650, when the price was $680. Figured $650 would act like strong support, figured $700 would act like strong resistance but if we overshot some set on $715.

I closed the $715 call calendar the day before earning's since the price was then at $650 and not budging, the entire market was selling off last week. Held the $650 through earning's, expecting flat or bearish movement. Sold 10am when price was at $650 for 240% gain.

I only take position sizes 1%-2% of portfolio so it's not a crazy amount in but huge gain and further proves me to the power of calendars and neutral structures placed at good support/resistance.

Am holding double calendar on TSL $220/$280, implied move is around 10% but this is something will close before earning's most likely. Calendars on Google $170/$185/$200, Vertiv $80/$100, Chipotle $50/$55/$60, many will close before earning's for secure profit and take smaller size of contracts through earning's.

Also did 208% on TSM by selling before earning's, if held through earning's this contract would've ran to $400 or 700% gain. I sold before to secure profit, closing $185 and $200 calendars ($200 was small loss). I didn't want to gamble TSM earning's outcome. So this is how I play double calendars and they work well!",20,26,1721692111.0,2024-07-22T23:48:31+00:00,t3_1e9tasn,options
132,TSM,"SMCI: Attractive Valuation, Great Potential","**POST-EARNINGS UPDATE:**

SMCI just delivered very disappointing Q4 results as gross margin (11.2% v 15.5%) and EPS (6.25 v 8.1) fell short of the lower bound of their previous update. The problem with FCF has also become severe.

Although their revenue guidance is still optimistic, **I no longer buy their EPS prediction**. Therefore, I need to acknowledge that my prior understanding of this company is wrong.

**I now downgrade my rating of this stock, from overweight to underweight. The price target is adjusted from 1050 to 600.**

**The earnings, on the other side, confirm that NVDA has a very strong quarter.**

**Original Post:**

AI frenzy is unfinished, yet the broader market suffered from a significant retreat this week. The PHLX Semiconductor Index dipped 6.86% on Wednesday, the worst performance since the pandemic. NVDA barely holds the 118 level, while other stocks such as MU, QCOM, AMAT, LRCX, ASML, etc., have dipped below key price levels. They are seeking support on MA120 (or at an even lower price).

I am paying attention to **SMCI**, a stock that may be less focused these days. SMCI lost more than 12% this week and closed at a price below 800. However, this dip has offered unique opportunities, reducing its post-earning risks, and making the price very attractive. Here is my analysis.

0. My Position:

**18 SMCI 01/17/2025 1200 C, 6 bought this Wednesday and Thursday at an average price of 71.6. My average cost is now 110. Although I have suffered a loss of 35%, I am sure that this is just temporary.**

1. Valuation:

**SMCI is trading at a PE TTM of 44.63 and a 1-yr forward PE of 22.17**. This is a very attractive price given its growth this year and the year to come. As a comparison, DELL is trading at a 1-yr forward PE of 16.17, with its growth much slower than that of SMCI.

SMCI is offering the market its unique stack-scale liquid-cooling system that can customized. With the surging demand for liquid cooling for AI server applications (especially the application of the NVDA B series), I expect SMCI to expand its portion in the AI server market while maintaining its current gross margin. The fundamentals of the corp are solid and I see great visibility in its future performance.

2. Technical:

SMCI is trading at a support level of 760-805 which is ultrastrong, which marks the dividing line between the bullish and bearish momentum. We can see that this level has been tested multiple times in the past 2 months, while strong buying has supported the stock in this range. All MAs (up to MA120) have converged, indicating the bottom consolidation to come to an end.

Besides, **the current price is only 7% higher than the closing price of the previous earnings call, while its peers in the semiconductor industry have surged by more than 20% (e.g., 25% for NVDA).** This indicates that the market may have digested the possible scenario of the stock failing to deliver results that are good enough. This risk-off emotion will help relieve some post-earning risks.

3. The broader semiconductor industry:

ASML delivered very good Q2 results, with a &lt;2% miss on its revenue guidance for Q3. TSM just delivered a blockbusting earnings report that beat the top and bottom lines on both quarterly performance and guidance. This indicates that chipmakers such as NVDA are having a very good season with demands surging even more than before. **This indicates that SMCI is also having a very great season where I expect its revenue and EPS to beat its bar which has far exceeded the market consensus**.

4. Rating:

**I now initiate an 'Outperform' rating for SMCI. The 12-month price target is set to be 1050, which indicates a potential upside of about 35%.**

The expected forward valuation is about 30, somewhat larger than its peers simply because of its growth.",13,24,1721431931.0,2024-07-19T23:32:11+00:00,t3_1e7hquw,wallstreetbets
133,TSM,More Earning's Predictions DD 7/22 - 7/26,"Have done some call outs on the sub of what I'm buying in the past, PLTR SP500 inclusion in June which ran, just of recent JPM which ran. So back with more DD on what am buying after reading motivating comments to continue sharing. (Those are *NOT* price targets, it's the current price.)

**Chipotle $53.48** \- Expecting 7%-10% move to upside, $50 to act as strong support if move to downside. I've opened calendars at $50, $55 (to sell before earning's), and $60. Ratio 3-1-3 so the ATM $55 cals just to pay off some of the risk, to sell *before* earning's. Extremely cheap cals with very high reward. This is what I look for. Win on one side totally offsets losses of other side. Expecting price $57-$59.

**Google $179.39** \- Expecting 10% move to the upside or flat, the market sold off heavily this week but Google was largely unaffected in-comparison. I've opened calendars at $170, $185, $200. Ratio 1-3-4 so the ATM $185 cals will sell half before earning's and others to hold through. If dumps downside protection $170 will cover some of the cost the other cals. This is my big play of the week.

**Vertiv $85.28** \- Expecting $80 to act like solid support, the next earning's will be their best quarter yet. It all comes down to forward guidance. I've opened $80 and $100 strike cals, may close everything before earning's as this company is too volatile to predict where jump will be or if trades flat. Jumps are 25% over the week which would put this around $110 pushing past its strong resistance of $105.

**American Airlines $10.61** \- Same story as Delta, should have good quarter compared to past quarters and report good earning's just like Delta and then sell off 3% barley moving up or down cause it's a boring not very volatile company. I have calenders at $9.5, $10.5, and $12. Holding through earning's everything, extremely cheap cals I probably shouldn't play this at all but all sides covered.

This week I closed $650 NFLX calendar for 240% gain, closed TSM $165 put for 204% gain which could've been 600%+ if held *through* earning's, but closed early for guaranteed profit and held the $205 cal which became a loss; still profitable overall closing the $165 and $185 calendars before earning's for profit. This isn't financial advice, I'm a regard trading calendars before earning's who should not be listened to or followed whatsoever cause you will lose money.",33,34,1721427232.0,2024-07-19T22:13:52+00:00,t3_1e7g18d,wallstreetbets
52,TSM,What are (in your opinion) the best buying opportunities arising from this dip? ,"I’m going to argue personally that nvidia is not one of them. They’re down less than 5% since Tuesday. Of course this metric alone means almost nothing, but I’d like to discuss companies which are great buying opportunities solely because of this dip. 

As others have stated, AMD seems to be a great buying opportunity. It’s down about 15% since Tuesday, from what I believe was already an appealing price. I’d say the same for Qualcomm. 

The broadest and likely “safest” are going to be TSM and QQQ. Personally I’m in a position where I’m deep in TSM and TQQQ, hedged with INTC. 

I’d like to add that I believe these tickers will all run downward a bit longer. I’ve lost bit of $$ due to impatience and buying too early. I do have funds in reserve for when I see evidence of a proper reversal. ",256,397,1721415704.0,2024-07-19T19:01:44+00:00,t3_1e7bk6j,stocks

18,TSM,The Wheel Strategy: An In-Depth Overview,"While a lot of you are familiar with the wheel strategy, it seems like newer users are looking for a detailed breakdown. As such, I hope this post will help new theta gang followers to understand the topic better. In addition, I hope this improves the quality of conversation within this subreddit, as this should be an answer to some basic questions.

Alright, here we go.

First let’s make a few things clear:

* The wheel is not a get rich quick scheme
* The wheel is an income generation strategy
* The wheel is great to reduce risk on an existing position, or a great way to get paid while waiting for your ideal entry
* The wheel isn’t a risk-free strategy, but might be the options strategy with the least amount of risk **IF** used correctly.

Now that we got this out of the way, we can go more in-depth on how it works and how one should use it. Of course, once you get more experienced you can tweak the strategy as much as you like, but it is crucial to understand all the risks associated with selling options.

**The Wheel Strategy:**

The Wheel is one of the most popular option trading strategies. It involves selling cash-secured puts (CSPs) to collect premiums on stocks you'd be willing to own **for the long term**. This is a crucial aspect if you are a beginner. A common fallacy is chasing high IV stocks for the big premiums, this is a surefire way to end up with stocks down 50% in your portfolio eventually.

If the options expire worthless or you close them early, as you believe the premium left in the contract isn’t worth the risk anymore, the premiums are all profit.  Essentially, the goal of most people trading the wheel is to sell CSPs and avoid getting assigned for as long as possible, but if the put ends up being ITM, you are obligated to buy 100 shares the stock at the strike you wrote. Rolling puts to collect more premiums and reduce assignment chances is a common tactic. But, keep in mind that it is only advised to do so when you can collect a net credit, without going up too far in time.

If rolling puts for a net credit is not possible, the most common tactic is to just let them expire and get assigned. This brings us to the next step of the wheel strategy, the selling of covered calls (CCs).

When selling CCs it is important to avoid selling the shares below your cost basis. The idea is the same, you continue to write CCs as long as the stock doesn’t rise above the strike price you wrote. This way, you collect as much premium as possible and avoid selling the shares at a loss. In addition, the premium received from selling CSPs and CCs can be used to buy more stock as you want to build out a position in the stock anyway. In an ideal scenario, the stock continues to rise at a steady pace and gets as close as possible to your strike price without getting assigned.

Eventually, the call will get exercised, or you sell the stock, as your long-term thesis is no longer valid or the stock gets overvalued in your opinion. If the stock pays dividends while you own it, you can collect those too.

This is why the wheel is sometimes called the **Triple Income Strategy** (C+P+ stock gains) or even the **Quadruple Income Strategy** (Triple Income + dividend payments).

Alright, now you have a basic understanding of how the wheel works. Let’s take a look at how the full process would work.

**1/ Selecting the Underlying**

The biggest mistake you often see is wheeling stocks you actually don’t want to own. While there is no perfect stock to use the wheel on, it is really important to emphasize that you should only do this on a stock you actually want to own and have the capital for to own 100 shares.

For example, if you have a $5k account you shouldn’t be writing puts on Microsoft $MSFT. If you still want to do this, you could write credit spreads on Microsoft with a small account, but I won’t explain this in this post as the post is already long. If you want me to explain other strategies in more detail, feel free to let me know in the comments and I’ll try my best.

I won’t go too in-depth on the fundamentals of companies you should try this strategy on as this is different for everyone, but there are a few rules in regard to position sizing and risk management you should keep in mind.

* Make sure you can take 100 shares of the underlying
* Make sure you actually want to own the company.

* This adds to the second point, but make sure it isn’t a crappy company. Preferably it is a steady business, which is growing.
* Something else I would like to add is: If you use this strategy on multiple different stocks, make sure you aren’t overexposed to a certain sector. For example, don’t have a 5-stock portfolio with NVDA, AMD, ASML, MU, and TSM. While this would be great in a bull run for semiconductors, you won’t be as happy in a bear market where you get assigned all the stocks at once.
* You can do the wheel on ETFs as well. SPY, IWM, and QQQ are great, but if you have less capital EWZ or EEM for example, are ideal candidates as well to reduce risk.

**2/ Selling Cash-Secured Puts (CSPs)**

Start the Wheel by selling CSPS. Make sure there aren’t any earnings coming up. As a beginner earnings or other big events are best to avoid as this can cause significant spikes or crashes in the underlying.

**General Rules for selling CSPs**

While you can sell Puts at whatever price and days till expiration (DTE) as you like, but a reliable strategy often involves some of the following criteria, to make sure you don’t get assigned too often and still get a decent amount of premium.

* In general, Opening around 45 to 60DTE is ideal for premium and as such theta/time decay. 30DTE also works, but in general, I prefer to roll or close the puts at 21DTE as a decent amount of the premium is often collected and the moves of the underlying are having a much larger impact as you get closer to expiration.
* 0.30 delta puts are a good starting point. For the ones not familiar with delta. In simple terms, delta represents the chance of the puts or calls being ITM at expiration. When you write a 0.30 put, you can see this as a 30% chance that the put will expire in the money. If you want to get in the stock or expect the stock to rise, a 0.50 delta can be interesting as the ATM puts lose value the quickest if the underlying moves up.
* Make sure your account can handle the amount of contracts you are selling and can handle the underlying be assigned.
* A general rule for **closing**: Most people using the wheel close the put once they have collected 50% of the premium. But, make sure this isn’t just one day before expiration. In general, if you write a put at 45DTE and the put has more than 21DTE left and you have collected 50% of the premium, it is probably a good time to close the put.

Rinse and repeat, if you have collected the desired amount of premium, just close the position and move on. I also recommend keeping track of all the credits you have received (and debits paid if the trade didn’t go your way) in an excel or gsheets document.

**3/ Selling the Covered Calls (CCs)**

First, make sure you know what your actual cost basis is. This is the strike you are assigned on – the premium(s) you have collected along the way.

* This is a lot more flexible IMO compared to selling CSPs, you can tweak the DTE and delta to your liking, as long as you are selling above your cost basis.
* If you don’t get assigned, let the CC expire and sell another.
* If you can’t sell CCs above the net stock cost, you have a decision to make. Am I comfortable selling for a potential loss? Because the CC also acts like a hedge against a potential further downtrend. Or, you can wait for the share price to rise above you cost basis and then start selling.

**4/ Rinse and Repeat**

The Wheel involves repeating the process, time and time again. It is an active management strategy and as such it requires time to utilize it.

**Most Common Problems:**

The biggest issue you might come across when using the wheel is the stock tanking. Once the stock tanks and you are assigned, collecting premium with writing above your current cost basis might be tough. But remember, you should only wheel stocks you don’t mind owning at the strike price you wrote the put.

Another issue is the stock rising too quickly. But in this case, you made money so you really shouldn’t be complaining.

Another common issue is impatience. Make sure you don’t break your trading rules you have set up for yourself. This might sound easy, but it is much harder if the stock actually moves against you fast.

**Biggest Takeaways:**

*  Use a document to track your credits and cost average.
* As a beginner, only do this on stocks you want to hold. Although, the goal is collecting income and not necessarily getting assigned it helps you sleep at night knowing that you aren’t wheeling some shitty stock that you don’t actually want.
* Stock Selection is key, this follows the above point.
* Diversify, don’t wheel stocks that are all in the same industry
* Size correctly, while it might be tough to wheel with a small account. Don’t use more than 20% of your capital. For big accounts, I would say no more than 5-10% per trade. It also depends on your risk.
* Make sure you have enough buying power remaining and that you have a buffer. A Six Sigma event might occur and you don’t want to lose everything.
* In large bull markets, the wheel will underperform a buy-and-hold.
* The wheel is an income generation strategy, which can outperform the indexes, but keep in mind that a covered call is somewhat of a hedge and as such you give potential upside away.
*  The wheel is a tool, but definitely isn’t the end all be all. However, it is a great addition to your arsenal of trading strategies or to optimize your buy-and-hold strategy to generate additional cash flows. As such, it might not be a suitable strategy for everyone.

Alright, that was it for this post. Obviously, there are lots more things that can be discussed, but this post is already getting very long.

Possible suggestions for other strategy explanations you would like to read are welcomed in the comments. My initial thought was to do a post on a short strangle as this is a natural follow-up on the wheel.

I hope this post was useful for some of you. If you have any questions feel free to let me know.",178,63,1721321821.0,2024-07-18T16:57:01+00:00,t3_1e6g9v2,thetagang

265,TSM,TSMC second-quarter profit beats expectations as AI chip boom continues ,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company on Thursday beat revenue and profit expectations in the second quarter, as demand for advanced chips used in AI applications continue to surge.

Here are TSMC’s second-quarter results versus LSEG consensus estimates:

Revenue: 673.51 billion New Taiwan dollars ($20.82 billion), vs. NT$657.58 billion expected

Net income: NT$247.85 billion, vs. NT$238.8 billion LSEG SmartEstimate weighted toward forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate

TSMC reported net revenue rose 40.1% from a year ago to NT$673.51 billion, while net income increased 36.3% from a year ago to NT$247.85 billion. The firm guided second-quarter revenue to be between $19.6 billion and $20.4 billion.

Chairman and CEO C.C. Wei in an earnings call on Thursday said business in the second quarter was supported by strong demand for its industry-leading 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer technologies, though it was offset by continuous smartphone seasonality.

Explosive demand for AI has stretched chip supplies. TSMC is the world’s main producer of advanced chips found in everything from smartphones to AI applications, though rivals such as Samsung and Intel have been trying to challenge its dominance. It counts Apple and Nvidia among its clientele.

“I also try to reach the supply and demand balance, but I cannot. Today, the demand is so high I had to work very hard to meet customer demand,” Wei told analysts.

“The supply continues to be pretty tight, all the way through 2025,” Wei warned, adding that the firm hopes the tight supply can ease in 2026.

The chip giant currently produces 3-nanometer chips and plans to commence mass production of 2-nanometer chips in 2025. Typically, a smaller nanometer size yields more powerful and efficient chips.

Development of 2-nanometer technology is “progressing well” and is on track for volume production in 2025, said TSMC. 

For the third quarter, the business is expected to be supported by strong smartphone and AI-related demand, said Wei, adding that they continue to expect 2024 to be “a strong growth year for TSMC.”

TSMC projects third-quarter revenue between $22.4 billion and $23.2 billion. This compares to $17.3 billion in revenue posted in the same period a year ago.

For its capital budget this year, the firm is narrowing the range to between $30 billion and $32 billion, versus a previous forecast of $28 billion to $32 billion. Out of this budget, 70% to 80% will go toward advanced technologies.

“We are working very, very hard to get enough capacity to support customers,” Wei said.

The firm further added that it is not ruling out the possibility of converting more “N5” technology into “N3″ technology to meet the strong demand for 3-nanometer chips.

TSMC shares closed 2.43% lower on Thursday, as Asian chip stocks tumbled on the back of a U.S. tech sell-off sparked by reports that Washington is considering tighter export curbs.

Big AI demand

Surging demand for advanced chips used in AI applications has boosted TSMC’s Taiwan-listed shares by nearly 70% so far this year.

“The demand for generative AI is surging in the cloud and at the edge. TSMC’s N3 process boasts good yield rates and well-managed production lines. The market is well-funded, and regional political factors drive increased demand for advanced processes,” Brady Wang, associate director of Counterpoint Research, said on Friday ahead of the results.

Wang said the capacity of the 3-nanometer process is expected to more than double in 2024 compared to the previous year.

Needham analysts on Monday said they expect TSMC to raise its 2024 revenue growth target, reiterating a “buy” rating and raising the price target to $210 from $168 on the chip giant’s U.S.-listed shares.

“We expect TSMC to raise its 2024 revenue growth outlook from ‘low- to mid-20s’ to ‘mid- to high-20s’ but maintain its 2024 [capital expenditures] target at $30 billion on the upcoming earnings call,” Needham said in a note.

TSMC held 62% of global foundry market share in the first quarter, up from 59% in the same period a year ago, according to Counterpoint Research data.

134,TSM,Why your port is getting nuked today,"Aight I know this isn't an educational sub, and I'm CERTAINLY not an educator, but tons of folks are asking why everything is falling harder than a 737 Max today. Given that the market forces influencing today's drop are less nebulous and more intuitive than usual, I figured I'd explain what I'm seeing. Bear in mind that I have no actual qualifications, most of this just comes secondhand from people smarter than me. 



There are two large scale things at work today that are getting the bulls gunned down in the streets; one is an overall force that's just inherent to how the market moves, and one is more specific to the current outlook and recent news.



**TLDR: Monthly options expire on Friday, and options on VIX (the volatility index) expire today. These lead to increased market volatility, multiplying every potential market shift. Couped with some pessimistic news for semiconductors and big tech last night and this morning, we were put at high risk of a big drop across the board.**





1) The Overarching Market Mechanic: 



There are two important expiry dates this week. First, Friday is OPEX, when monthly options expire. This happens on the third Friday of every month, and creates volatility as big money tries to influence the market in the direction that benefits them. Naturally, this volatility is most felt by the tickers that have the highest volumes of options expiring that month. Currently that's big tech, MAG7 and semiconductor centric stocks in particular.



The other date is today, when VIX options expire. This happens on the third Wednesday of every month, which means it's usually (but not always) two days before OPEX. VIX is a measure of volatility in the market as a whole, rising when the market is fluctuating more and falling when it's consistent. In the same way that stocks get more volatile when options on them are close to expiry, volatility itself gets more volatile when VIX options are close to expiry. So volatility is changing at a faster rate.



Both of these add up to make this week more prone to big swings in market prices overall. Without this extra volatility, the market is more likely to continue on its trend and pace (consistently bullish of late). These dates instead make reversals and spikes/dives more likely, but they're not inherently bearish.





2) Specific Developments:



There have been a few developments since yesterday's close that increased bearish sentiment. First, current presidential betting favorite Donnie T seemed to commit to not defending Taiwan against potential Chinese aggression during his RNC speech last night. This is bearish for Taiwan-based companies and those dependent on them, which most significantly includes the leading semiconductor manufacturer TSM and the tech companies dependent on it, NVDA most of all. We can see that Intel is doing particularly well, up over 1% during today's bloodbath, because they're one of TSM's largest competitors and aren't dependent on Taiwan.



Second, ASML (a Dutch semiconductor manufacturer) released disappointing earnings this morning. They technically beat EPS expectations, but were down since last quarter and had only lukewarm future guidance. This is a big step down from the recent expectation of continued exponential growth for semis and AI-related stocks, and decreases optimism for other companies in the same field. Which, once again, is big tech.



Third, news came out this morning that President Biden is considering increasing restrictions on chip sales to China in order to slow their growth in their own semiconductor market. Restrictions on sales are obviously perceived poorly for growth, so this is once again bearish for chip makers and those dependent on their success. TSM, NVDA, and Big Tech in the crosshairs again.



All of this combines into bearish news for semiconductor companies specifically, and Big Tech by extension. Since Big Tech makes up a huge portion of the market, it drags down everything. We can see this in SPY, 34% tech, failing almost twice as much as something like IWM, only 15% tech.

  


In a quick summary: a few pieces of pretty bad news for semiconductor and tech since yesterday's close increased bearish sentiment across the board. Since we're in a period of higher volatility due to options expiry in the entire market and on the volatility index, this bearish news had a much larger impact than it normally would. Volatility will probably cool off next week after the VIX options expiry and monthly OPEX, TBD on whether we get some upwards push in the tech market movers.",501,132,1721241486.0,2024-07-17T18:38:06+00:00,t3_1e5pr79,wallstreetbets

29,TSM,Many Calendars Before Earning's - Part 2,"Calendars are horizontal spreads which have become my go-to structure. They're cheap, superior to verticals imo, start delta neutral, and can profit in 2 ways.

They can profit from the rise of IV in the long leg, greater appreciation due to Vega being higher in long leg than in the short leg even though it's not a Vega play. They also profit from Theta as well if you hold the short leg to expiration which then leaves you with a call and premium.

**Risks:**

1. Slow moving companies like Pepsi &amp; Delta I just learned are not good candidates to sell *before* earning's and must be held through. Nobody is buying the long leg, playing the 2nd week like they would a tech company or volatile company. So the short leg see's IV increase, giving higher probability a OTM contract finishes ITM so delta increases while the back leg remains flat seeing no increase in value because IV didn't increase and delta remained flat. The short leg appreciates and long leg stays flat causing a loss. Unless you hold short leg to expiration.
2. With volatile companies like TSM's upcoming earning's, the IV increase between both legs is pretty consistent so the long leg will appreciate as the 2nd week out is being bought in anticipation of earning's, unlike behemoths like Pepsi where ppl only really playing the week of earning's. So volatile companies can be sold *before* earning's or the IV crush will greatly shrink the breakeven range and will affect the long leg much more than company like Pepsi.

So calendars have a lot of moving parts, are far more complex than people realize trading skew which I still am grasping to understand. What I do understand is slow moving companies like Pepsi and Delta failed to produce results before earning's but holding through earning's has given me results now. While big tech companies or volatile companies have been able to give results selling *before* earning's.

I'd imagine you can hold volatile companies through earning's too but chances are get blown past trying to predict where price will go which is much easier to predict with companies like Pepsi and Delta than it is with TSM, which is why would close TSM before earning's and hold companies like Pep through earning's. Volatile tickers playing rise in IV, behemoth tickers playing Theta burn.",14,2,1720726869.0,2024-07-11T19:41:09+00:00,t3_1e0xodp,options

266,TSM,Sony and other Japan chipmakers to spend $30bn in production race,"TOKYO -- Major Japanese semiconductor makers including Sony Group and Mitsubishi Electric are planning around 5 trillion yen ($31 billion) in capital investments through 2029, as they move to boost production of power devices and image sensors.

Nikkei compiled capital investment plans for the fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2029 period by Japan's eight major chipmakers: Sony Group, Mitsubishi Electric, Rohm, Toshiba, Kioxia Holdings, Renesas Electronics, Rapidus and Fuji Electric.

Seeking to revive the domestic chip industry, they will increase investments in power semiconductors, sensors and logic chips, all considered core technologies in growth fields such as artificial intelligence, decarbonization and electric vehicles.

Capital investment in the communications equipment sector, including semiconductor manufacturing, increased 30% over five years to 2.1 trillion yen in fiscal 2022, according to a Ministry of Finance survey.

Chipmakers' share of overall manufacturing investment rose from 11% to 13% over the same period, becoming the third largest spender after transportation machinery -- which includes automobiles -- at 15% and chemicals at 14%.

Sony Group is investing approximately 1.6 trillion yen from fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2026, with plans to increase production of image sensors. Demand related to smartphone cameras and other products is strong, and applications are expected to expand to autonomous driving as well as factory and store monitoring.

The company set up a new facility at its site in Nagasaki prefecture in fiscal 2023 and announced plans to build a new plant in Kumamoto prefecture, both on the southernmost main island of Kyushu.

With an eye on expanding markets for AI data centers and EVs, investments in power devices that control electricity have picked up pace, with Toshiba and Rohm investing about 380 billion yen in total.

Toshiba will increase production of silicon power devices at a factory in central Japan's Ishikawa prefecture, while Rohm will increase production of energy-efficient silicon carbide power devices at a factory in Miyazaki prefecture in Kyushu.

Mitsubishi Electric will increase its production capacity of silicon carbide power devices 5-fold in fiscal 2026 compared to fiscal 2022. It plans to invest approximately 100 billion yen in a new facility building in Kumamoto prefecture. ""We will set up a structure that can compete with industry giant Germany's Infineon Technologies,"" said President and CEO Kei Uruma.

In 1988, Japan held 50% of the world's semiconductor market share, but from the 1990s on, South Korean and Taiwanese companies invested heavily with the support of their governments to take the lead. Having lost out in the investment race, Japanese players withdrew one after another from cutting-edge technology development in the early 2000s, resulting in a market share in 2017 of below 10%.

In around 2020, as U.S.-China tensions heightened, the Japanese government designated semiconductors as a critical material for economic security. Coronavirus pandemic supply chain disruptions intensified the need to secure domestic production capacity for the chips that determine the competitiveness of a country's digital industry.

In logic semiconductors for AI, Rapidus aims to produce cutting-edge 2-nanometer products. A prototype line will be operational by April 2025 in Chitose on the northernmost main island of Hokkaido.

The Japanese government has decided to provide as much as 920 billion of the total 2 trillion yen required in investments for the project, which will include research and development costs. Rapidus plans to move to mass production in 2027 and may increase capital investments in the future.

The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry has set a goal of increasing sales of domestically produced semiconductors, including those made by foreign companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., to over 15 trillion yen by 2030, triple the amount in 2020.

The government earmarked 3.9 trillion yen for subsidies from fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2023, with 3 trillion yen going toward major chip companies both in Japan and overseas. The 3.9 trillion yen figure is the largest among developed countries in terms of its percentage of gross domestic product.

Of the 5 trillion yen in investments currently planned, the government will subsidize about 1.5 trillion yen.

The market share of semiconductor manufacturers headquartered in Japan in 2023 was 8.68% in terms of sales, up 0.03 points from 2022, marking the first increase in seven years, according to British research company Omdia.

""With the largest investments in their history, Japanese companies' semiconductor production will continue to grow after 2024, and their share will continue to recover,"" said Akira Minamikawa, a senior analyst at Omdia.

CVNA, TSM, NFLX am considering opening 7/26 cals OTM, selling the 7/12 weeklies to lower cost basis, having room to play run-up in price before earning's, and leaving calls unlocked for the week of earning's for max gain.

I've been playing earning's the week before, 10-12 days out and not the week of like most do. Would it be better to prepare playing the 3rd week out instead of 2nd in further preparation? Or is it too far out and a lot can happen with market between then which is worrisome? How are you playing these earning's if you play earning's?",24,14,1720036359.0,2024-07-03T19:52:39+00:00,t3_1duniw2,options

32,TSM,Delta shown differently for same option ?,"These screenshots show two views of the same TSM option in the same account (10-banger 😎 but only 3 😢)

Thinkorswim shows a delta of 99 whereas Schwab shows a delta of 32 - why is that?

The only thing I can think of is that ToS is taking into account my cost basis whereas Schwab is just showing the generic stats of the option as of today. Now I’m pretty sure that’s it, but I thought delta was always calculated with the price and other stats of today. What’s the point of calculating delta for your original price? I could see using “cost basis delta” for something like setting a sell rule for yourself but I don’t really understand how it’s calculated - are there recommended strategies around this?

63,TSM,Market questions and advice ,"I invest into the stock market I've had a couple plays in and out over the years and invest a chunk of my money into VOO and VOOG mainly, but I want to start investing in big tech stocks but I don't know if it's really worth it at the top of the market. My question basically is would it be smart to invest now and or DCA into stocks like NVDA, AMZN, GOOG, MSFT, META, TSM and/or wait for the stock market to pull back, just wanted some outside opinions and ideas that maybe I haven't thought of. Any advice is helpful thank you!

33,TSM,Bullish On Dell In The Medium Term (8/2 Expiry Call Option Analysis),"*NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR*

DELL, TSM, and NVDA had a tumultuous week influenced by profit taking into OPEX resulting an interesting buy opportunity for DELL in the medium term. Dell specifically is what I was drawn to with the price approaching 200 MA. The 200 MA shows the bullish sentiment on Semiconductors and Dell carries well with NVDA at that these bullish stages. 

In general strike prices 140-160 Low Volume, Slightly Leaning Negative Delta Put Buying, High Open Interest. Seems to present a Bearish Consolidation bias. 


Plan:
Original position down on $4.50 premium currently valued at $3.50

Existing Position 7/26 @ $160 
.2843 Call Delta
104 Volume 
456 Open interest 

If negative price action occurs :
In general know that dates 6/24- 8/2 at 140 finds support on put buying sentiment slowing. Will Average down if the stock prices goes below the $141 level. Average down with 8/2 @ $150 Strike. From this position stop losses market sells are set to trigger at -10% of the premium price. 

If Consolidated Price action ensues
Open interest to Volume gaps needs to close to something closer to 1:1 to confirm bias to buy at $145 level. 

If positive price actions occurs sell the current option 1:2 or 1:3 Risk Reward. 

(Any references for how to guide risk reward ratios would be helpful. Typically setting RR intuitively based on the IV, news, and sentiment primarily gauging it from seeking alpha, yahoo finance, and Robinhood to speculate reversal or to confirm price action. 
Similarly at market close on the day long time frame I analyze the change in stock price and daily volume compared to the previous day’s close. And Volume and Open interest at different strikes. Increased option volume suggests more active trading reflecting bias towards confirmation of that days price action. Negative or neutral change to open interest implies fewer outstanding contracts that might not actively be participating in the price movement thought of as the market waiting for confirmation.

- **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (log variance of daily gains) of the underlying asset and compare that to the current implied volatitlity (IV) of the option price. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium associated with the pricing of options (implied volatility).
    
- **Directional Bias:** Ranges from negative (bearish) to positive (bullish) and accounts for RSI, price trend, moving averages, and put/call skew over the past 6 weeks.

- **Priced Move:** given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move.

- **Expiration:** 2024-07-19.

- **Call/Put Premium:** How much extra you are paying for the implied move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean options are ""cheaper."" High numbers mean options are ""expensive.""

- **Efficiency:** This factor represents the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price of the option. It represents how much traders will pay in slippage with a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.

- **E.R.:** Days unitl the next Earnings Release. This feature is still in beta as we work on a more complete list of earnings dates.

142,TSM,"Liquid cooling for data centers, HPE, and you","Hi regards,

You may know me from posts like ""Short CRM"", ""Buy HPE"" and ""how to lose your ass on CPI Day NDX puts"".

Another post you may have seen is my play on VRT - which was mostly focused around the fact that they are the main player in the data center liquid cooling (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bk8ruo/the\_next\_semiconductor\_data\_center\_play\_vertiv\_vrt/) - which I recommended a few months ago when they were trading in the 70's. This play actually saved my ass when TSM ate shit after previous ER during the market dip in March.

So this brings me to today and next week. Recently it came to my attention that HPE also launched data center liquid cooling solutions. And, if you read my VRT post, basically everyone is going to need some liquid cooling data center infrastructure soon because NVIDIA's top of the line Blackwell chips will demand it.

On top of that, HPE's Discover event is starting next week. I have a feeling that Liquid cooling is going to make a splash (so to speak). Now just go and take another look at VRT's 1-year chart. Mmmmmkay.

I wouldn't be surprised if HPE hits $30 by Sept if the stars align right. Load up on shares and calls.

I added 2000 shares to my long term account yesterday... still holding 550 (\~$100k position now) call contracts expiring at different dates in my degenerate account, with the longest leg expiring in Sept which should be after next ER. Definitely diamond-handing this one.",153,188,1718372197.0,2024-06-14T13:36:37+00:00,t3_1dfr0m3,wallstreetbets

AVGO calls single-handedly saved my portfolio - yet I can't feel my emotions anymore from the past 3 months of trading options and staring at the screen.   
Got into options from the TSM craze in March and was left bag-holding OTM calls. Portfolio was down 70% after burning away profits playing weeklies and revenge trading. Made a couple of Gs from guessing earnings correctly (META,SHOP puts; GOOGL,APPL,ORCL calls, etc.) but lost double that with weeklies and 0DTEs.

And I appreciate you and your knowledge! I can’t post photos of it because of the community guidelines, so I typed out the email:

*Options Upcoming
Dividend*

TSM will lock in dividends for its shareholders on Jun. 13, 2024. Due to the upcoming dividend, you're at a heightened risk of being assigned on your short TSM calls. It is important to consider the risk of holding this position through the ex-dividend date.
If you are early assigned and it results in a short equity position on Jun. 13, 2024, you'll be responsible for paying the dividend instead of receiving it.

Please carefully review your positions. If you're concerned about the upcoming dividend, there are additional actions you could consider taking, such as:
• Rolling your existing position to another option.
• Closing out some or all of the spreads with this risk in your account.
• Buying to close your short call prior to the ex-dividend date.
• Exercising the corresponding long leg of the spread prior to the ex-dividend date to capture the upcoming dividend. This will offset the potential dividend obligation from being assigned on your short option. This will also require adequate buying power in your account. You can do this in-app or by reaching out to our support team.
To help protect you from the upcoming dividend risk, we may close out positions if you do not take action prior to the ex-dividend date.

58,TSM,TSMC ponders boosting AI chip production prices for Nvidia: Morgan Stanley,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) is seriously considering increasing its production fees for artificial intelligence leader Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) , according to a report by Morgan Stanley.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang apparently agrees with the notion.



""TSMC's wafer price is indeed too low,"" said Huang at a Computex investor luncheon in Taipei on Wednesday.""I think TSMC's \[service\] price is too low,"" and that ""TSMC’s contribution to the world and the tech industry is under-presented by its financial results,"" he added.""NVIDIA is TSMC’s key customer and accounts for 10% of TSMC’s 2024 revenue, we estimate,"" said Morgan Stanley analyst Charlie Chan and others in a note. ""We believe that if NVIDIA accepted price hikes, other key AI semi customers may follow.""

""We think NVIDIA's management recognizes TSMC’s reliability, as it helps remove one of the largest risk factors – foundry production,"" Chan added.NVIDIA did not confirm the timing or amount of a wafer price increase.TSMC hiked its prices by 10% in 2022 and another 5% in 2023. Morgan Stanley believes TSMC could raise prices by another 5% for 2025, due to AI semi demand.

Other major TSMC customers include Apple (AAPL), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO), Qualcomm (QCOM) and MediaTek (OTCPK:2454-TK).""We believe TSMC will be a winner in AI semis in the long term,"" Chan noted. ""No matter where the growth is coming from – GPU or ASIC, cloud or edge AI chips – most, if not all, will likely be manufactured by TSMC's leading-edge foundry services.""Morgan Stanley rates TSMC Overweight, as most analysts are very bullish on the stock.

64,TSM,2 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks,"For context, I planned on holding the original stocks for a few years, but ended up parlaying into AI when I developed strong conviction.

In previous posts, I shared more about the ‘why’ behind the investment decisions and reallocation. The previous 1 year update is here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1\_year\_followup\_on\_buying\_the\_dip\_on\_pandemic/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/) Interestingly, the stock I lamented missing the run up on (Nvidia) is now by biggest holding and one of my best performers.

# Tracking progress

Below are the gains for this portfolio (opened in 2022) as of May 31, 2024. 

# Realized (sold)

**2023 Totals**

* **Affirm (AFRM):** +18.09%
* **Allbirds (BIRD):** +6.89%
* **Coinbase (COIN):** +6.42%
* **Carvana (CVNA):** +845.57%

* **Unity (U):** +27.57%

All realized gains/losses were long-term (capital gains rate) except Carvana (CVNA) and Allbirds (BIRD). 

Peloton was a big loser and the only one I almost immediately regretted, but it was a relatively small investment that was more than offset by others. 

**2024 YTD**

* **Snowflake (SNOW):** +51.57%
* **Unity (U):** -8.73%

* **Shopify (SHOP):** +46.37%
* **Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM):** +60.76%

**Purchased in the last week/month**

I had extra cash, so I purchased small amounts of these in the last week or so: 

* **Advanced Micro Devices (AMD):** -2.98%
* **ARM (ARM):** -1.88%
* **Intel (INTC):** -1.42%
* **Microsoft (MSFT):** +2.32%
* **Tesla (TSLA):** -0.54%

I know these are all less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I’d like to maintain some anonymity around it. 

# Rate of return

The total rate of return since inception (June 2022 to May 2024) is **77.90%**. 

# 3 ways my investing evolved

I’m still well within the ‘maybe I’m just lucky’ phase since it’s only been a couple years, but I’ve noticed I invest differently now than I have in the past: 

1. Insight 
2. Conviction 
3. Patience

**Insight**

I’ve learned to largely ignore headlines and talking heads, which seem more reactionary than insightful and optimizing for entertainment (clicks/views). 

Ben Graham’s quote rings true: 

&gt;“In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.”

Perhaps counterintuitively, I’ve found it more useful to read/listen to tech/business analysts who focus on strategy and how that interacts with macro trends (along with financials) than solely financial analysts and stock pickers. 

Financials are a good indicator of fundamentals, but are backward-looking. However, valuation is forward-looking, thus driven by strategy x trends x structural advantages, so we must consider both. 

# Math

In 2023 I also started practicing math daily (243 days straight as of this morning) in order to better understand the mathematics behind AI. As part of that, I had to take remedial coursework to build my foundations since it had been so long since I’d done any meaningful math. 

I’m not sure how much, but it *feels* like it helped with the reallocation decisions I made in late 2023 and early 2024. I felt more confident and deliberate in making trades. The math journey has been quite challenging, but personally rewarding, whether it has helped or not. 

**Conviction**

A big part of this is just a better understanding of myself and what kind of investor I am. I invest in what I believe in long-term. 

However, someone trading on volatility with a much shorter timeline may not care about conviction. You must understand what investment philosophy aligns with your psychology and your strengths. 

Conviction investing works for me because, even when building products (my day job), I’ve always been strong with product vision/strategy and always building for the future, so it makes sense that I invest the same way. I’m not sure why it took me so long to connect those dots, but I’m happy I did. 

A big part of this is also timing. AI seems to be a once-in-a-generation opportunity. Whereas 5 years ago I might have tried to force myself to believe crypto was the next big thing in the absence of anything substantial. 

This is another reminder that success (in investing or otherwise) is all about timing and opportunity. When opportunities arise, you must seize them.

**Patience**

As a result of my convictions, I’m much more patient in my investing these days and don’t react to the day-to-day. 

I wouldn’t be surprised if I don’t make another trade for the rest of 2024.

**UPDATE:**

A commenter asked about benchmarks, which I failed to include since I don't pay attention to them, so I had to look it up:

I opened my portfolio in June 2022. Since then the cumulative S&amp;P return is \~28% (\~39% for Nasdaq). My cumulative return for that same period is around \~215%.

Williams met with Taiwan Semiconductor President C.C. Wei, the news outlet reported, citing sources close to the situation. The meeting, described as low-profile, may have centered around obtaining access to Taiwan Semiconductor's 2 nm process.



Apple and Taiwan Semiconductor did not immediately respond to a request for comment.



Taiwan Semiconductor, the world's largest foundry, also manufactures chips for companies such as Nvidia (NVDA), AMD (AMD) and others.



Cupertino, Calif.-based Apple is reported to be working on chips for its in-house servers to handle some of the intense AI workloads that will be unveiled at this year's developer conference, scheduled for next month.



The first chip that may come to Apple's servers is its M2 Ultra, with plans to bring its latest silicon, the M4, to its in-house data centers. The M4 was unveiled earlier this month, along with new versions of the iPad Air and iPad Pro.



Chief Executive Tim Cook said recently that Apple has advantages in the AI space that its competitors do not.



""We believe in the transformative power and promise of AI, and we believe we have advantages that will differentiate us in this new era, including Apple's unique combination of seamless hardware, software and services integration, groundbreaking Apple's silicon, with our industry-leading neural engines and our unwavering focus on privacy, which underpins everything we create,"" Cook said on the company's earnings call, held earlier this month.",32,7,1716296493.0,2024-05-21T13:01:33+00:00,t3_1cx7clm,wallstreetbets

267,TSM,TSMC’s April Sales Jump 60% on Sustained Demand for AI Chips,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. saw April sales jump 60% to NT$236 billion ($7.3 billion) as sustained artificial intelligence demand was helped by the beginnings of a recovery in consumer electronics.

The world’s largest contract chipmaker is running well ahead of estimates for revenue growth in the current quarter, after sales increased by 34.3% in March, buoyed largely by insatiable appetite for AI semiconductors. The global smartphone industry returned to growth over the first three months of the year, including in the highly competitive Chinese market, which may drive orders for TSMC’s traditional mainstay of mobile chips.

US-traded shares were up 3% in New York in early trading on Friday.

Hsinchu-based TSMC weathered a year of muted demand for personal electronics last year, which Nvidia Corp.’s highly sought-after AI chips helped make more tolerable. Now the AI boost is pairing with rising prospects for consumer demand, though TSMC Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei has cautioned about the pace of any recovery.

The company’s shares soared to an all-time high in April, as it remains in an enviable position to benefit from the rise of AI technology, being Nvidia’s sole manufacturer for the most advanced training chips. TSMC also fabricates semiconductors for Apple Inc., which just announced a new lineup of iPads, and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., the closest competitor to Nvidia in the AI chip race.

TSMC’s board approved a cash dividend of NT$4 per share, the company announced on Friday.

14,TSM,Morgan Stanley hikes Price Target on Arm Artificial Intelligence CPU boost,"Is anyone seeing this or is it just me. Are we talking about TSMC here or...

Morgan Stanley analysts hiked their price target on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TW:2330) (NYSE:TSM) (TSMC), citing improved prospects for the world’s biggest contract chipmaker from artificial intelligence-geared processors based on **Arm technology**. 

TSMC’s price target was raised to T$928.0 from T$860.0, while Morgan Stanley analysts also maintained their overweight rating on the stock. The updated PT represents an upside of 16% from TSMC’s last close of T$800.

Morgan Stanley analysts said that increased demand for processors based on British chipmaker **Arm Holdings**' (NASDAQ:[**ARM**](https://www.investing.com/equities/arm)) technology was expected to be an important growth driver for TSMC, given that the chipmaker makes almost 100% of all **Arm-based processors**. 

**Demand for Arm-based processors is expected to pick up amid increasing adoption of AI**, while TSMC’s CoWoS chip packaging technology is also expected to factor into advancements in AI chip development.

Morgan Stanley expects TSMC’s foundry share in global CPU markets will be close to **60% in 2028**, up from 37% in 2023, and will also become a bigger revenue driver for the firm.

Increased development of in-house, AI-geared silicon by major tech firms- such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)- also factors into improved prospects for TSMC, given that foundry work for the chips will be outsourced to the Taiwanese firm. 

AI darling NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)- which is among TSMC's biggest customers- also develops its most advanced **AI chips on Arm**.

Increased demand for AI chips fueled stronger earnings from TSMC in the first quarter. But the chipmaker had also warned that AI demand may not be sufficient in offsetting a broader decline in chip demand, especially amid weaker global PC and smartphone sales. ",7,6,1715138488.0,2024-05-08T03:21:28+00:00,t3_1cmuqp4,wallstreetbets

161,TSM,One of these chips is not like the others… Laying the bull and bear case for NVDA,"TLDR at the top.

Chicago Bears case:
1. General market uncertainty. SPY facing resistance
2. Geopolitical threats in the form of Chinese aggression to Taiwan and sanctions from US

Chicago Bulls case:
1. Most explosive growth of any company, growing revenue and profit almost 20% Q/Q over the past year
2. Strong future demand, first to market advantage with no immediate threats
3. The chart and timing of May 22nd earnings. 
4. Shorts can’t help themselves trying to call crash

My positions:
Jan2025 1000c
May 24 950c

The bear case is self explanatory so I will not go into much detail. 
We are coming to the end of a massive QE cycle and almost everyone has lost spending power. Money is tight which risks a broad market sell off. I will look for more bank failures home and abroad to signal a short term dump. 

A significant threat from China would shake everything TSM touches. Right now we see posturing from the CCP and the occasional show of aggression when the politics call for it, but no signs of imminent invasion yet. 

The bull case is simply bulletproof. Breaking down the above points below: 

The earnings are in. AMD revenue has been flat for 3-4 years and they are supposed to compete with NVDA? They are not in the same league - no one is. NVDA is the only mega cap stock putting up these kind of numbers. Speculation is a bull’s best friend, and the trajectory is unparalleled with this stock. 

Cryptocurrency mining is not going anywhere, and it just got more expensive to mine after the latest round of BTC halving. More computing power = more revenue for miners and this market competition will intensify. NVDA price seems to correlate with BTC but the crypto mining revenue stream is consistent. The other revenue stream is of course AI applications in which an arms race is taking place. 

The psychology of us ‘investors’ is mostly really stupid, but the buzz matters. This is the only company anyone is excited about. Market makers know this and they know they can fetch a high price when earnings rolls around. The chart is set up for new heights with the dip bought within a week. I plan on holding my jan2025c through earnings. NVDA for the past year has beat the seemingly aggressive expectations it sets for itself. They say 24B revenue this quarter but I think closer to 27B. Let the speculation begin. It will be interesting to see if we get another dip before a significant event like last earnings feb 2024 and GTC meeting March 18. If so, I buy more.

Good luck everyone! Don’t do anything impulsive or regarded and please add your disrespectful bear and bull thoughts in the comments. ",14,18,1714537068.0,2024-05-01T04:17:48+00:00,t3_1chd3ny,wallstreetbets

TSMC reported net revenue rose 16.5% from a year ago to NT$592.64 billion, while net income increased 8.9% from a year ago to NT$225.49 billion. The firm guided first-quarter revenue to be between $18 billion and $18.8 billion.

TSMC is the world’s largest producer of advanced processors and counts companies such as Nvidia and Apple as its clients.

“For the second quarter of 2024, we expect our business to be supported by strong demand for industry-leading 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer technologies, partially offset by a continued smartphone seasonality,” CFO Wendell Huang said during the firm’s earnings call Thursday.

CEO C.C. Wei said TSMC expects 2024 to be a “healthy” growth year, supported by “our technology leadership and broader customer base.”

“Almost all the AI innovators are working with TSMC to address an insatiable AI-related demand for energy efficient computing power,” said Wei, adding that the firm estimates revenue contribution from server AI processors to “more than double this year.”

TSMC expects second-quarter revenue to be between $19.6 billion and $20.4 billion.

TSMC currently produces 3-nanometer chips and plans to commence mass production of 2-nanometer chips in 2025. Typically, a smaller nanometer size yields more powerful and efficient chips. 

Strong demand for AI chips led by the proliferation of large language models such as ChatGPT and Chinese clones has caused TSMC’s shares to surge 56% in the past one year.

“TSMC is well-positioned for strong performance based on key industry trends. The continued demand for advanced chips, particularly those used in AI applications, is a positive sign for both the short and long term. The focus on advanced chip development, like the shift towards 3nm technology, is another factor driving long-term growth for TSMC,” Brady Wang, associate director at Counterpoint Research, said on Monday ahead of the results.

TSMC accounted for 61% of global foundry revenue in the fourth quarter, according to Counterpoint Research data. Samsung Foundry came in second with 14% of the market.

“TSMC’s net profit margin continues to be one of the highest in the company’s history at 40%, against an industry average of 14%, demonstrating TSMC’s strong competitive position. The high margin is the result of an increased share of sales of 7nm and smaller chips, which have significantly higher margins,” Grzegorz Drozdz, market analyst at Conotoxia, said last week.

Last year, TSMC’s business was impacted by macroeconomic headwinds and inventory adjustment. Smartphone and PC makers stockpiled chips during the pandemic, leading to surplus inventories as Covid-era demand waned.

Earlier this month, Taiwan was hit by an earthquake – its strongest one in 25 years. A TSMC spokesperson said its construction sites were normal upon initial inspection, though workers from some fabs were briefly evacuated. Those workers subsequently returned to their workplaces.

“There were no power shortages, no structural damage to our fabs and there is no damage to our critical tools, including all of our extreme ultraviolet lithography tools,” CFO Huang told investors and analysts on Thursday.

EUV machines are critical in the production of the most advanced processors.

However, some wafers were affected and “had to be scrapped,” said Huang, adding that the firm expects most of the lost production to be recovered in second quarter, with “minimal impact” to revenue.

The U.S. also recently granted TSMC’s Arizona subsidiary preliminary approval for government funding worth up to $6.6 billion to build the world’s most advanced semiconductors. TSMC is also eligible for about $5 billion in proposed loans.

Now, for contracts expiring that week or even lets say under a month within that event, the IV crush could be seen (with less crush the further the contracts are). 

I have some TSM calls for the ER expiring June 21, and the current IV sits at 41% for 160c and 43% for 180c. The vega is pretty high and almost as much as delta so a significant drop in IV could offset any gains the stock would make. 

I am wondering how far out does the effect of IV crush takes place? And am I correct in thinking that the further out the expiry the lesser the IV crush? Is there any way of calculating how much IV will be affected?",5,4,1713317283.0,2024-04-17T01:28:03+00:00,t3_1c5xcdq,options

28,TSM,What would you do? Let it expire or cut losses,"Hi everyone,

Before I start, I want to say that I still consider myself new to the options selling side with less than a year of extremely low risk plays.

So here is the situation, I decided to sell TSM 134P expiring this week. Sold them for about $100 a contract. Where I stand now is at a 200% loss on the contract.

I do not mind owning TSM as a stock as I still think it has a few years of growth left (barring any China shenaningans which I do not expect in the short term). If I am assigned, I think I can wheel it and get decent returns.

What would you do in my situation? It is trending down now so there is a chance of assignment, but I am still about $7 away from break even. Would you just hold or close and cut the losses at this point?

I’m highly optimistic about these upcoming earnings for TSM given their March report and how little they’ve grown compared to NVIDIA, yet they are the one providing the chips. I’m fairly new to options trading in terms of actually understanding what the Greeks mean and actually analyzing an options. So here is my question, what does an IV of 57% mean in terms of a TSM call that expires 4/19? Does this imply that the option has already priced in the fact that the underlying stock will move 57% by that expiration date? Is this generally a high IV and does this mean I should stay away from this contract? This has probably been answered but I figured this is the place to ask.

Been so interested in SMH as well, but wanted more general TECH exposure. I stumbled into IXN. I like how it has the top 3 tech (microsoft, apple, nvidia) and then some semi conductors (some international)  - I like TSM a lot. Wish the percentage was bigger. 

Wondering if it's weird to have 
50% SWPPX
25% IXN
25% my eVtol bet.

I know SWPPX and IXN has like 50% overlap but that just increases my weight on some companies.

On the other hand should I just VT + IXN?

If there's other tech ETF pls recommend!

17,TSM,South Korea mulls $7B investment in AI chip manufacturing,"South Korea plans to invest 9.4T won (about $6.94B) in AI by 2027, to maintain its position in semiconductors as countries around the world step up efforts to boost local chip manufacturing, Reuters reported.

&amp;#x200B;

The announcement made by South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol also consists of a separate 1.4T won fund to support AI semiconductor companies, the report added.

&amp;#x200B;

By setting aside investments and a fund, South Korea intends to expand research and development in AI chips such as artificial neural processing units, or NPUs, and next-generation high-bandwidth memory, or HBM, chips, the government said, as per the report.

&amp;#x200B;

The country will also promote the development of next-generation artificial general intelligence, or AGI, and safety technologies which go beyond existing models.

&amp;#x200B;

Yoon intends South Korea to become one of the top three countries in AI technology including chips, and take a 10% or more share of the worldwide system semiconductor market by 2030, the report added.

&amp;#x200B;

Semiconductors are vital to the Asian nation's export-driven economy. In March, chip exports surged to their highest in 21 months at $11.7B, or nearly a fifth of total exports shipped by the country, according to the report.

&amp;#x200B;

The U.S. is providing funding through its CHIPS Act, which aims to increase U.S. semiconductor manufacturing and research, especially in advanced semiconductors.

&amp;#x200B;

Several companies are expected to get funds under the act, with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) already having inked a deal for about $20B in grants and potential loans, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) signing an agreement for up to $6.6B in grants and as much as $5B in loans. Samsung Electronics (OTCPK:SSNLF) is expected to be awarded more than $6B.

&amp;#x200B;

Japan is also providing subsidies to companies to boost domestic chip manufacturing.

18,TSM,Taiwan Semiconductor's Q1 revenue surges amid AI chip boom,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing's (NYSE:TSM) first-quarter revenue rose 16.5% year-over-year, amid a boost in demand for artificial intelligence applications.



TSM — which produces chips for some of the world's largest tech companies including Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) — saw first-quarter revenue of NT$592.64B (about $18.54B), compared to NT$508.63B ($16.72B) in the same period a year ago.



For the first quarter of 2024, TSM had forecast revenue to be between $18B and $18.8B, the company had said during its fourth-quarter earnings in January. The Consensus Revenue Estimate for the first quarter is $18.06B.



The quarterly figures beat LSEG SmartEstimate of NT$581.45, according to a report from Reuters.



TSM's revenue for March 2024 surged 34.3% year-over-year to NT$195.21B, while it grew 7.5% month-over-month (NT$181.65B in February).



The company is scheduled to report first-quarter earnings on April 18.

This is good news considering Nvidia (NVDA) earnings is just over a month away, and we may expect to see a rally coming soon as Nvidia earnings approaches. ",166,41,1712741543.0,2024-04-10T09:32:23+00:00,t3_1c0hhrh,wallstreetbets

Today, I opened a $16K position into APR26 expiring $160.00 $TSM calls. I believe the fundamentals and performance for TSMC are top notch and have not changed. The earthquake in Taiwan has been confirmed to have had little impact to TSMC operations and should not effect forward looking statements in a considerable way. TSMC is also a unique company in that they report monthly revenue figures. This reporting is expected this Wednesday (4/9/24) and should give clear visibility into earnings which is currently scheduled for 4/18/24. 

The awarding of Biden's $6.6B U.S. production for TSMC's Arizona foundry is the icing on cake which I believe was not properly baked into the stock during today's trading session. Wanted to post here ahead of time as I've been seeing people only post after their exit. 

  
Note: I do not know when I will be selling out of the position. It maybe after the monthly revenue figures on Wednesday if we get a solid beat and the stock rallies. Since revenue figures are posted on a monthly basis, the earnings report is primarily useful for the forecast. If the forecast is anything short of phenomenal, I am expecting a sell the news moment which may not be worth the risk. Also important to note that Wednesday's CPI and FOMC meeting along with Thursday's PPI updates could result in meaningful updates so definitely trade with caution. Lastly, I may or may not add more to this position as this week continues and will keep anyone interested updated! Good luck

269,TSM,$6.6 Billion Grant To Be Awarded to TSMC by the Department of Commerce CHIPS Office For a Third Arizona Fab,"[Source](https://www.forbes.com/sites/willyshih/2024/04/08/tsmcs-chips-act-grant-has-arizona-reached-a-tipping-point/?sh=f5cf3907c684)

&gt; The Department of Commerce CHIPS Program Office announced a $6.6 billion grant to the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) this morning. As part of the announcement, the company said it will build a third semiconductor chip fab in Arizona, and that it will also bring its most advanced manufacturing processes to the U.S. This is on top of the $40 billion the company is already spending for the first two fabs, which was the largest foreign direct investment in the history of Arizona.

&gt; With increasing concerns for supply chain resilience, domestic supply will be attractive as long as the price is competitive. Hopefully that will come with time, as TSMC knows it will have to fill those fabs after completing them.

&gt; While $6.6 billion is a lot of money, it is a relatively small fraction of what TSMC is committed to spending in Arizona. It’s also about 17% of the CHIPS budget for subsidies

182,TSM,This earthquake is about to start a catastrophic and cascading dump that affects the overall market ,"The reasoning is simple. 

1. Earthquake slows down production of TSM. Evidence of this has already occurred: https://www.benzinga.com/amp/content/38062166

2. Chip stocks in general move together. NVIDIA will also thus be affected

3. NVIDIA has been the ticker to characterize the bull market 

4. This will cause a cascading sell off in other equities 

You heard it here first. Every step of this reasoning is logical. Try refuting it (you can’t).

19,TSM,TSMC Earthquake DD,"**Like most of you guys I was initially worried about the earthquake and. TSMC.**

**HOWEVER.... I remembered that Taiwan is on the ""Ring of Fire""**

**AKA where all the tectonic plates hit each other a ton creating volcanoes and ELEVATED EARTHQUAKE RISK.**

**\*\*QUESTIONS TO ASK\*\***

**1) Why would TSMC not consider ""Ring of Fire"" in their own contingency/safety plans?**

**2) Why would Nvidia and AMD lawyers not put in clauses requiring elevated safety standards and precautions to offset risk?**

**Article 1:** [**TSMC Case Study - Earthquakes**](https://esg.tsmc.com/en/update/governance/caseStudy/1/index.html)

**Article 2:** [**Shock Absorbers Help Taiwan Chip Plants Avoid Quake Damage**](https://www.asiafinancial.com/shock-absorbers-help-taiwan-chip-plants-avoid-quake-damage)

**Key Points from Article 1:**

* Following the September 21, 1999, Chi-Chi earthquake in Taiwan, TSMC has laid down a series of earthquake protection management plans surpassing legal requirements. The company has conducted a comprehensive investigation on all buildings and facilities, set up dampers to improve building structures, and adopted new anti-seismic technologies and methodologies to assess and control the risks.
* TSMC's strategy is to simultaneously enhance the seismic resistance of facilities along with emergency response skills. On February 6, 2016, another earthquake struck southern Taiwan, in Mei-Nong District of Kaohsiung. It was the most powerful earthquake experienced by TSMC Fab 6 and Fab 14 in Tainan Science Park. With the above antiseismic methodologies, TSMC's Fabs were safe from structural damage, chemical leakage, process tools misalignment, fire and casualty.

|2000|

The seismic coefficient was improved beyond legal requirements by as much as 25% for main structure of new buildings, 50% for nonstructural components. New seismic anchorage was installed onto equipment and facilities.

|2008|

The greatest potential earthquake hazard analysis of each site, evaluation of anti-seismic ability of hardware facilities. Dampers were installed along with new Fab; seismic response was reduced by 15 - 20%.

|2012|

Floating piles were installed in new Fabs of Tainan Science Park, which decreased seismic amplitude by 25% in the Fabs. Evaluation of raised floor shaking table test and improvement of process tool anchorage.

|2013

Installation of seismic isolation platform onto furnace tool.

|2015|

Establishment of Earthquake Early Warning System. 

|2016|

Additional stoppers were installed for tower stocker to prevent sliding and ceiling bracings added to strengthen ceiling.

**The guiding principles of TSMC earthquake management policy are ""Zero casualty, short operation recovery time and least impact on customers"". Cross-Fabs post-earthquake emergency response procedures and business continuity plans were established according to these guiding principles. Constantly and systematically, TSMC minimizes damage caused by earthquakes and enhances anti-seismic ability.**

**Article 2:**

# Shock Absorbing Plant Designs

“In terms of foundries, due to shock-absorbing plant designs, earthquake vibrations inside fabs are one level of magnitude less than outside,” the semiconductor group said in a note on Monday, adding that it had received no reports of substantial factory damage.

“In the worst case, some machinery required initialization after crashing,” it said. “In terms of memory, [**Nanya Technology**](https://www.nanya.com/en/) has already carried out a shutdown inspection. If there was any wafer damage, Nanya maintains sufficient inventory to compensate.”

Meanwhile, [**Micron**](https://www.micron.com/) had recalled engineers to inspect its equipment “and has confirmed no losses. Thus, the capacity utilization rate of these two companies has not been affected nor has supply,” the TrendForce report said.

In regard to panel makers, it said the panel industry was currently on a down cycle because of serious sustained oversupply issues.

“Panel makers are reducing production in succession. Global average utilization rare in 3Q22 is expected to be revised to 65%,” it said. [**Innolux**](https://www.innolux.com/en/product-and-tech/tech/foplp.html), based in Tainan, had also started reducing producing on a large scale last September.

“Thus, the actual impact of the recent earthquakes should be limited in severity,” it concluded. “Machinery had been slowed or shut down for maintenance during the earthquake and operations have, subsequently, been resumed.”

Factory campuses had cancelled weekend overtime and returned to a normal shift schedule with only the sintering process in continuous operation. But the power supply in the Kaohsiung area was not affected by the quake and production line sintering furnaces remained in normal operation, the report said.

# Taiwan’s Importance

It is worth noting that Taiwan’s importance to the manufacturing of semiconductors, or computer chips, is similar to Saudi Arabia’s dominant position in OPEC and the global oil trade.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the self-ruled island’s biggest company, has a [**more than half of the global foundry market**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/100-day-supply-chain-review-report.pdf), while other Taiwan-based manufacturers claim a further 10% of the market.

One of the reasons for US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to the island last month was allegedly to [**convince TSMC to set up a manufacturing base in the United States**](https://theconversation.com/taiwan-dominates-the-worlds-supply-of-computer-chips-no-wonder-the-us-is-worried-188242).

It’s big money – the global semiconductor market was worth more than $520 billion in 2021. And with chips used in so many products these days, the sector’s importance has risen dramatically.

People in Taiwan are probably saying a quiet prayer of thanks that the weekend’s quakes were not a lot worse

To see my previous post about my TSM YOLO, check the following link: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/0t9kViIxQo

Given TSM's monthly earnings next week and their quarterly earnings on the 18th, I expect the stock to go higher and print me some tendies. TSM has been consolidating for a month now and it would have prolly scared a lot of paper hands but me, I have 💎 hands all over here👐. I did roll over some 200/220c into lower SP calls as they were bleeding everyday, but apart from that I have only added to my position so far. Hoping for the stock to end the week on 150, with a good rise next week due to great monthly ER following an uptrend onto the quarterly ER on 18th, from where I hope it will skyrocket into the 180s.

29,TSM,300k Account Wheel Update - Month 18,"Hello all!

This is the March 2024 update. Find the previous update [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/1b42kmg/300k_account_wheel_update_month_17/).

In March of 2024 I closed 25 trades with an average hold time of 19 days to collect $7,642 in premiums. This month went well. I got a bit more aggressive which led to me rolling one position, which ultimately ended up being profitable for me, and also being assigned one position. Currently negative on that new position (ROKU), but I'm able to sell calls on it easily as my basis is right around the current share price. I'm fine holding the company as I think it is undervalued at the moment due to the vizio/walmart news.

Below are the March trades:

My total **realized** profits after 18 months is $117,557. I have **unrealized gains** of $1,300.

**This brings my NET profit to $118,857. This equates to a 39.6% gain on the initial 300k I started with. QQQ is up 48.3% and SPY is up 30.5% in the same time frame.** 

I did a good job outperforming the QQQ this past month as my account was up 2% while QQQ was flat this month. QQQ is still outperforming over the past 18 months, though I'm slowly closing the gap. SPY actually outperformed QQQ this month, being up 2%, which was in line with my account. I'm happy to be outperforming SPY over the past 18 months though. I do believe if there is any volatility or broad market pullbacks, I'll be able to catch up to the QQQ and outperform. The goal isn't to outperform on any given year though, but to return a consistent 10-20% yearly gain. So far my annualized rate of return over the past 18 months is 25.5% which I am very happy with.

Below is the P&amp;L statement for my account and all current positions.

189,TSM,ASML: the Next stock in the AI market move,"Who is asml? I’ll keep this simple. They are a leader in the manufacturing of chip making equipment.  Companies like Intel and TSMC buy their equipment to make chip plants

Why is ASML so interesting? Cause they are making the world’s first 2 nano meter lithography machines (that’s really fucking small and enables next level AI chips and memory). Per the article below they are already sold out to Intel and others and are expanding their capacity

I’ll keep this straightforward: Nvidia and Micron, Intel , etc all need this tech to make more and more powerful AI chips.  

https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/asml-launch-high-na-lithography-machine-2nm-chip-manufacturing-i9dac?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_ios&amp;utm_campaign=share_via

Risks: this 2 na tech is brand new and very cutting edge.  There maybe delays as it gets production ramped up as TSM and others evaluate and work through kinks

Now let’s look at the stock:

It’s at all time highs and isn’t cheap with a PE of 44 (vs 75 for NVDIA).  Note it actually have a dividend yield at .68%. So the metrics are a little expensive but not really stretched.  I expect their next earnings call (April 17) to be a huge catalyst as  2na adoption is discussed

TLDR:
These guys have the shit every chip mfg is going to have to have to compete for the most advanced AI processors and memory.   This is a “shovels and mortar” play for AI and will be a slower stock rise than others but should see another 50% in the next year as people see 2na chip machines get bought.  Near term catalyst is April 17 earnings call. 

Note: there are real risks with chip tech this advanced. I wouldn’t YOLO it but if you want to be more risky i would do some slightly out of the money option plays if your due diligence agrees with mine around April 17. Personally i am doing stock for now.

a) buying SMCI puts the friday right before their entry into the S&amp;P was announced

b) being up on NVDA calls 1/2 weeks ago and not taking profits and having them slowly sucked away as NVDA went sideways / fell through the beginning of GTC conference

195,TSM,NKE puts for all you regards that lost money through TSM,"For all you regards who lost all your money this week, gather round cuz you can make it all back with puts on $NKE. 📉🔥

First off, these earnings coming up? They ain't lookin' pretty. Analysts getting cold feet and slashing those EPS and revenue estimates like there's no tomorrow. Revenue estimated to be down 1% YoY, operating income down 7%, EPS down 6%...I'm talking fiscal Q3 '24 lookin' like a dumpster fire. 🗑️🔥

China used to be Nike's golden goose but now it's turning into a lead balloon. Politics messin' with the brand and Winnie the Pooh ain't playin' nice no more. 🇨🇳💩 If China sneezes, Nike catches a cold.

Also, wanted to cop me some fresh Nikes from Footlocker the other day but they were out of my size. And those sales peeps couldn't care less about finding me an alternative. Nike losing mindshare on the sales floor, you heard it here first. 😤

Now I ain't no 🌈🐻 but facts are facts. EPS estimates down 11% in the last year, revenue estimates slashed by 5-9%. Free cash flow yield finally hitting 4% - first time since 2019! Too little too late if you ask me. 📉

Technical traders getting ready to short this to the earth's core if it breaks $82. Morningstar trying to prop it up with that cute lil $136 ""fair value"" but internal models ain't buying it, putting it between $85-100 tops. 📊

Nike might've bounced back from that ""brown shoe craze"" in the 90s but this feels different. Inventory to revenue ratios just getting back to normal after 3 brutal quarters...and who knows if this is the new normal. 📦📉

So unless JPow turns on the money printer again or Xi Jinping starts rocking Jordans, I'm staying the hell away from $NKE. Puts on deck, maybe nibble on some lottos if it craters post-earnings. 💸🎰

TL;DR - Nike r fuk, inversing Morningstar and buying puts on anything above $100. See you on the moon...or in the food stamps line. 🚀🍜

196,TSM,Is Gigacloud Technology (NASDAQ: GCT) A Scam?,"I did a DD for this company last week here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bazhkv/gct\_is\_set\_to\_take\_off\_with\_earnings\_next\_week/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bazhkv/gct_is_set_to_take_off_with_earnings_next_week/)

 Today I sold all my shares. 

Long story short they missed the deadline for their 10-K after annoucning a too good to be true looking earnings result on friday which wouldn't alone have been too sus however the founder and insiders have since dumped a lot of shares in past 2 days and the market has been spooked. 

 I want to believe their numbers but I think my best assessment is this: I fucked up. Even if the numbers gets audited and it comes out okay it's not in the clear. I watched 'The China Hustle' documentary and even if KPMG China (their auditor which is not KPMG but rather a Chinese subsidiary) gives them a rubber stamp like they have done before for chinese fraud companies it will not prove anything.  [https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1H60E9/#:\~:text=BEIJING%20(Reuters)%20%2D%20Global%20accounting,out%20of%20over%20%24400%20million](https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1H60E9/#:~:text=BEIJING%20(Reuters)%20%2D%20Global%20accounting,out%20of%20over%20%24400%20million).

If legit  it's currently one of if not the most insanely undervalued company in the world and yet their founders sold shares knowing full well the operations of the company.  There are two likely scenarios , something I don't want to say for the remote possibility of a defamation lawsuit or even they do not believe or trust their own numbers. 

I have likely been duped and am just breaking after a large gain since I initially purchased 7 weeks ago but put more at the peak the day the earnings report was released.  A guy I have been talking to who was up more on this stock 400% on Friday also sold their entire position after they pulled this stunt. I may have missed out on a rocket trip but Gigacloud has lost my trust. Stable bluechips like TSM it is from now on. ",32,31,1710952649.0,2024-03-20T16:37:29+00:00,t3_1bjhunm,wallstreetbets

198,TSM,Is my fear overblown?,"When markets fall, it's typically the most speculative asset (ie BTC) that gets dumped first. If you've seen the movie Margin Call, Jeremy Irons said the way to win is to be smarter or cheat, and he doesn't cheat, so it's helluva easier to just be first. 

Some of you know I've been losing my ass on puts the last couple of weeks, about 10k combined on NVDA and others that ended up worthless. I've in the past few days sold more than 50% of my holdings so now I'm 3/4 cash and 1/4 securities. The cash is making ~4.97% on SPAXX so it's not like it isn't gaining but I'm chickening out because I've seen this before - and no I'm not talking about forward PE or anything rational but rather the overall feeling of a feeding frenzy. 

I'm holding TSM (also calls for 5/19), INTC (and LEAPS), IONQ, RIVN, SOXL ($21 avg), BA (and calls for Jan '25) HOOD, and SOFI. Plan to close all my CSP before JP opens his mouth tomorrow.

As the title says, I am unsure if there will be issues if I invest in TSM in Roth IRA? Since it's technically a foreign company? Or should I open a different investment accnt?

Or it doesn't matter and I can invest in whatever stock that Schwab can let me buy and be able to sell it later on without any issues?

21,TSM,AI missing link,"Let’s discuss potential missing link for the AI boom before it spirals into oblivious amount of worldwide adoption and hopefully find a missing link before it kicks off big time because that’s direction where  technology is headed.

First of all we need to discuss what could AI potentially mean for our future and what implications it might have.

To my best of knowledge from reading various statements and articles, AI is going to take a big chunk of jobs across all of the sectors.

Logistics

Teslas Cybertruck will have an option of following one another and therefore you’ll have a fleet of trucks, commandeered by one driver who’s first in the convoy, cruising on a highway
Tesla is already mapping all the roads to perfection before the commercial usage of cybertrucks to it’s fullest.

Automation of factory jobs

There’s activist already actively protesting like we’re back in 1760 during the start of the industrial revolution.


Healthcare 

An AI doctor is currently learning about (Chatgpt-like software) that’s potentially going to make better judgments and diagnosis then the doctors themselves
We still might be a long way down the road from this one, but money is clearly being dumped into projects like these 

Education 

AI softwares will have an ability to recognize students learnings patterns and adapt the learning program to each student individually.
Results have been proven already at staggering 62% grade improvement. 
Not everyone learns the same and that’s the problem AI will fix

These are very few of many sectors in which AI will intertwine with our lives and it’s only the beginning. 

As with all booms in the tech, AI is the logical next step.

For AI to achieve massive adoption it needs computing power, advertisement and ___________?

To break them down

Computing power

If you haven’t heard about Nvidia, Dell, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing etc.  you must live under a rock
These companies have been under the spotlight for a while now and they’re making record deals and gains.
For example.in 2013 Nvidia sold 1.5mil units of their H100 GPUs to Meta, Microsoft, Google and other companies for 37.5Billion in revenue only from 1 processor(wait times were about 6 months).
They’re also expecting to ship 2 million of the same GPU in this year.
With currently a supply being shorter then the demand, many companies are on a race to pick up the biggest pie of the cake and that was reflected on their stock prices.
With that being said ,Computing Power was one fragment of AI boom where the money could have been made by us investors( that’s if you recognized the opportunity on time) .
Not saying there’s no more money to be made in this sector but we’ve definitely come far, fast. 

The next fragment needed for a massive adoption of AI is advertisement.

Google and Amazon are taking the first spots 
AI is directly used in advertising products across all of the sectors.
It’s abilities are reducing the amount of manpower for the job and it’s is also self advertising by doing so.
These kind of automated tasks will give companies the ability to reduce labour cost which will directly translate into higher revenue.
Massive adoption of AI in advertisement sector is coming sooner then you think. 

For a seed to become a tree it will need water, sunlight,and carbon dioxide.
As we mentioned above, massive AI adoption will need Computing Power, Advertisement and something else to really take over the whole technological sector like a wildfire.
The reason why I believe it needs something else to spark is because it’s simply not there yet.

There’s been great opportunities to make money in the last year with crypto going parabolic, especially AI projects, plain company stocks that sell/manufacture semi conductors, playing call options on their earnings, holding or playing call options on microstrategy etc.

With all the above being said, I’m asking you redditors, what is the missing link? 
If we could figure out where will the next big money flow into, we can be ahead of the game and make some serious money.
If Massive AI adoption gas it’s carbon dioxide and water, what would sunlight translate into?",10,30,1710821181.0,2024-03-19T04:06:21+00:00,t3_1bibf6l,wallstreetbets

- **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (log variance of daily gains) of the underlying asset and compare that to the current implied volatitlity (IV) of the option price. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium associated with the pricing of options (implied volatility).
    
- **Directional Bias:** Ranges from negative (bearish) to positive (bullish) and accounts for RSI, price trend, moving averages, and put/call skew over the past 6 weeks.

- **Priced Move:** given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move.

- **Expiration:** 2024-04-26.

- **Call/Put Premium:** How much extra you are paying for the implied move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean options are ""cheaper."" High numbers mean options are ""expensive.""

- **Efficiency:** This factor represents the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price of the option. It represents how much traders will pay in slippage with a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.

- **E.R.:** Days unitl the next Earnings Release. This feature is still in beta as we work on a more complete list of earnings dates.

- **Why isn't my stock on this list?** It doesn't have ""weeklies"", the underlying is ""too cheap"", or the options markets are too illiquid (open interest) to qualify for this strategy. 480 underlyings are used in this report and only the top results end up passing the criteria for each filter.",27,20,1710770413.0,2024-03-18T14:00:13+00:00,t3_1bhrf2w,thetagang

1. **Semiconductor Shortage**: We all know there's a global chip shortage, right? Well, TSM is one of the big dogs in the semiconductor game, and they're poised to capitalize big time on this shortage. More demand equals more tendies for us.

2. **Tech Boom**: With everything going digital, from 5G to IoT to self-driving cars, the demand for chips is through the roof. TSM's got the tech and the chops to meet that demand and then some.

3. **Top Dog Status**: TSM ain't just any semiconductor company; they're the top dog in the manufacturing game. They're pumping out chips using cutting-edge tech like 7nm and 5nm processes. That's like printing money, baby.

4. **Supply Chain Master**: While other companies might be struggling with supply chain issues, TSM's got it locked down tight. Their solid supply chain and diverse customer base mean they're not just surviving the chaos; they're thriving in it.

5. **Bullish Buzz**: You know how hype can send a stock to the moon? Well, TSM's been getting some serious buzz lately. Whether it's talks of new partnerships or killer earnings, the sentiment around TSM is sky-high, and that could mean big gains for us.

208,TSM,"Went full regard on calls, which ones should print?","Hello fellow regards, I went full regard on NVDA, TSM calls for next week GTC and TSM earnings in a month. Planning to get rid of NVDA calls after GTC if there is a high jump in the stock and it reaches 975-1000 level. For TSM, not sure if I am holding until earnings or selling before, I'll see based on how the stock moves. They should have their March earnings report come out too so that could be a good catalyst if it is good. Might lose some money of 200/220 4/19c's but those were bought just to have more shares to control for cheaper never meant to be held until expiration. 

Along with these, I also jumped on the MSTR hype train with the short squeeze going on and the stock growing parabolic due to HF's having to buying the stock back to cut their losses. Was planning to sell this before the weekend to avoid theta, was 1k up on the call too but did not have my device to sell it so couldnt go thru with it. Planning to get out of it this week if MSTR does really good, else might try to breakeven if not.

I also got some ORCL calls for their earnings. Since they were far OTM they got IV crushed. I was up 1k on them at one point but decided to hold for the NVDA conference due to their ""exciting partnership with NVDA in upcoming week"" announcement. Will sell the 140c's if the stock goes high due to the announcement, might get rid of most of 150c's too but will hold onto 160c's I think.

I might even add 5% individual semi companies that don't have a big % in QQQ like TSM and ASML(because they have a low % in QQQ).

I also wanna add 5% BRK and VISA/MA and JPM.

The post starts with the briefest and memiest description of what TSM is you could possibly have and then immediately begins with the speculation. We have havent even established what the company does and already we are gawking at ""them"" (whoever the fuck they are) bidding it up 5%. Then like every APE lurking in this sub **OP  talks about a short squeeze**. **TSM has a short interest of 0.4% btw.**

This is the first paragraph of the first post. red flags should be going up in your mind. if they arent, you might be dumb.

**We go into a brief as fuck description of why we would pick TSM over NVDA, SMCI, ASML, and INTC. note that only 1 of these companies actually does the same thing as TSM and thats INTC.**

Just as an example how shit some of the reasoning are for buying TSM over those companies -

**His entire take for not buying ASML is it can't SQUEEZE because you can't buy it on RH. The short interest on ASMl is 0.22% btw.**

we are like 200 words or less into this post and already we have referenced a short squeeze twice, both times on companies with less than 1% short interest, and compared TSM to a bunch of companies that dont even do the same thing TSM does.

We get around to TSM. Now mind you, he has yet to tell you what TSM even does. And suprise suprise he still doesn't directly tell you here.

**He claims that Samsung needs to fab 5x what TSM does to get the same yield. This is questionable to say the least. on 3nm both companies are struggling with low yield, like 50-60%.** [https://hothardware.com/news/tsmc-samsung-reportedly-struggling-with-3nm-yields](https://hothardware.com/news/tsmc-samsung-reportedly-struggling-with-3nm-yields)

**On 4 NM both companies are about equal, around 80%.** [https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/18/samsung\_tsmc\_processor\_plans/](https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/18/samsung_tsmc_processor_plans/)

then we get a fucking semiconductor FORUM and told to ""do your own research there"".

and finally we are given **his positions.** You should probably be suspicious of someone giving you stock tips on a position **hes already entered for 60k.**

We could have an entire discussion on whether giving stock advice or taking it actually has any value and I could rant about it for awhile but I'll just say Jesse Livermoore, a famous investor, learned early never to take any tips from anyone as they likely already had a position themselves and just wanted you to effect the direction of their trade for their benefit, and never gave his own tips unless he already had a position.

**I'm sorry guys but if you bought a call based on this post alone you are stupid.** You might not like hearing that, but I'm just trying to do you a favor. You have poor literacy, you live in memes, you thrive off shallow pools of information like some degenerate bottom feeder, and you likely lack what it takes to make money actively trading.

He opens the post by saying he hopes you bought calls so if OP wants to try to skate away by saying well i told them to do their own research blah blah. He hopes you listened to him in his 1st post here and bought calls cause look! theyd be up!

**The rest of the post is aggregated SemiWiki (the forum he told you to ""do your own research on"") posts OP read. I want to just quote one -**

Semiwiki User - ""Why TF is Intel building a foundry and will you give  Intel dibs on production? If semi demand drops, they are fucked!""

**He quite literally post stuff PEOPLE ON A FORUM SAID. He does this 3 more times on the post.** its hard to know if those people are themselves posting links to sources because OP doesn't source the posts he got these from.  The one quoted above is 100% just something a forum user wrote that OP posted back to you cause he liked it.

We get OPs takes on Samsung and Intel talent. Samsung nepo baby (no source) Intel boomer graveyard (no source).

**Then he says the word autism a bunch and all the monkeys in this sub clap along.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Again if you didnt go in on the first post but the second post really was the one that got you you sir are a fucking moron. You do not have the cognitive skills to trade actively. Just stop.**

&amp;#x200B;

**The rest of the posts are all just news aggregation**

&amp;#x200B;

Quite literally all any of these posts do is aggregate mostly US new sources on TSM. He likely is just yoinking these off that SemiWiki forum he fucking loves and then reposting them to you for updoots.

**You could have gotten the same thing from the** [**yahoo.com news page on TSMC**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSM/)**.** It also aggregates news stories for you. Or the google news tab on a search for TSMC.

And as I pointed out on multiple occasions under some of these very same posts -  **TSM is a country halfway across the world in its own timezone with its own news cycle.** For instance when the US news cycle was consumed by reports about TSM getting a 5 billion dollar awarded from US government the Taiwan news cycle had reports about Taiwan officials clarifying the use of deadly force was permissible on unidentified hostile boats and aircraft in its territory, all as China pushed the boundaries of Taiwan's international waters with its ""grey"" zones and multiple Chinese aircraft and ships were detected in Taiwan's territorial space.

All that on a day TSM dropped like 5%. It is difficult to ever really say for certain why a stock falls but to say that had nothing at all to do with it would betray a real ego on the part of the reader. To think there are no better informed more serious traders out there trading in the same stocks as them that might sell based on negative local news.

&amp;#x200B;

**In essence there is nothing wrong here and I dont mean to be mean to OP. You can have a take, make a post, then if people like it update them on news.**

**The problem is with you - if you fell for this and this alone you are stupid.**

&amp;#x200B;

I hope TSM goes up. I own 14.5% of my portfolio as TSM shares at a rather tasty avg price. I own almost the same portion of large cap growth stocks, about 15%. So my portfolio is very TSM heavy. I just couldnt ignore how dumb you guys were being over this though.

**Not once in any of this discussion are the financials of TSM brought up** save 2 sentences about revenues that are only included because they were in the news cycle. The financials are stellar btw, so OP is lucky, but the fact nobody ever bothers to really talk about them is fucking troubling.

&amp;#x200B;

People will say this post is long but it takes very little words to put out some hot garbage and a lot more to explain why its hot garbage. Edits were to clean up some spelling mostly.",208,148,1710468507.0,2024-03-15T02:08:27+00:00,t3_1bf2we8,wallstreetbets

Use this ON TOP of any financial analysis you've ALREADY DONE. This is a guide for which options are good deals and which options are bad deals. I don't care if you buy puts or calls, that's up to your analysis, but if you do buy them, make sure you choosing ones that are a good deal.

Below is a list of options with their current bid and asking price, with this models estimated bidding prices next to it. The `Est Bid` is it's fair value compared to all of the options, and the `Rel Est Bid`  
 is it's fair value compared to the options with the same expiration.

213,TSM,It's not over for TSM...,"As a fast food worker I dumped my entire brokerage into TSM calls expiring 4/26 and 5/17 30-40$ OTM around its rise last tuesday-wednesday. These past few days I peer into the TSM chart and my emotions of selling start to get to me. At one point my brokerage had 32k and now it is sitting at a fine 9.5k and probably going to go down even more tommorow. BUT I HAVE auTSM and I WILL NEVER SELL.  


Getting rid of the emotional sides of things and thinking logically, this is a great stock if you bought calls either 4/19 or more out. I am down 20kish but logically TSM follows NVDA and NVDA is having their GTC meeting in a few days and then we have another monthly revenue report from TSM next month and a few days after their earnings. As a regard assuming the GTC only brings good news, TSM will rise at least 3% that day, monthly revenue report next month will boost TSM around 5-8% and then the final kick of the bucket is their earnings which Implied Volatility will certainly rise and boost our calls with a almost guaranteed beat in earnings which will boost the stock 10-12%.   


if you bought calls expiring this month ur fucked

I bring to you news again from the front-lines of the greatest battle ever to waged in the 21st century - **The AI Chip Wars**

On March 12th the Arm Holdings Expiry was released and employees where free to sell their shares. There were many articles fanning fear that the ARM apocalypse would ensue during this tumultuous week. And the confabulation that Arm's parent company SoftBank would simply UNLOAD billions and billions of shares and simply dilute and pummel the Arm stock into submission.

I was fearful, not going to lie. But I held Diamond hands and decided that I would not hedge or buy puts or short positions for a temporary ""feared"" sell-off.

I am here to tell you. ARM Held - NOT GIVING A DAMN INCH of pull back.

SoftBank protected the ARM Holdings position and did NOT let the stock go below $125. Look at the tiny trade volume standing tall. That GREEN Wall of protection ensued a wonderful and grande blockaide against puts and short sellers and profit takers. In the words of Karp (PLTR) - I love watching short sellers crumble and things about their drug dealers (some shit like that.)

Look at the volume a day / 2 days later. Nothing much. Their is not a major sell off AT ALL. ARM has passed the lock-up period test.

Oh and before we go to the Barron's DD I wanted to share with you something spectacular.

In this video. I want you to realize how profound of a time you are living in where we can do this technology. It is truly mind-blowing. And what you must understand is that ARM is and will be at the forefront of this. The way the robot see's the world, can think about the world and speak and interact with the world will all be done on ARM CPU's and GPU's.

This is the future and AI chips will be in this robotic control plane. From Tesla's Optimus to Figure AI 01 to the multitude of lesser and perhaps cheaper versions will all be powered by efficient and accelerated compute localized to the corresponding robotic device.

&gt;Most importantly, Arm's highly integrated and low-power characteristics make [delivery robots](https://deliveryrobotic.com/Robot-Chassis/) more compact and durable while significantly reducing manufacturing costs. This substantially enhances their competitiveness in the market.  
&gt;  
&gt;In summary, Arm's chip applications in the field of [delivery robot](https://deliveryrobotic.com/Robot-Chassis/) technology have changed the game, providing unprecedented value and experiences for robot manufacturers and end-users. With further technological advancements, we have reason to believe that Arm will continue to lead the revolution in this field, bringing more surprises and possibilities to the world.

It is truly an amazing time we live in to see the ground floor of these start to take root.

Finally, I bring you Barron's (paywall avoiding  article) [ARM CEO SEES A HUGE TAILWIND FROM NEW CHIPS - NVIDIA &amp; INTEL ARE HELPING TOO](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/arm-ceo-sees-a-huge-tailwind-from-new-chips-nvidia-and-intel-are-helping-too/ar-BB1jQwIi?ocid=hpmsn&amp;cvid=bfd8eddd85354651a411fc14ff77c4b1&amp;ei=42) written by Tae Kim.

&gt;Arm’s latest advanced chip technology, called Armv9, generates double the royalty rates of its previous Armv8 products. For some high-end processors, which combine more than 100 “cores,” Arm’s designs are now pulling in more than $100 per chip. It’s a massive change from prior generations.

Arm's high-end Chips are earning over $100 per chip. That is a MASSIVE change.

&gt;Cloud server chips based on Arm technology also benefit from the rapid growth in AI with Nvidia using Arm for its GH200 AI Superchip data center systems. A GH200 Superchip can have up to 144 CPU cores and Arm gets paid for each one.  
&gt;  
&gt;The question for investors now is whether the company’s recent financial performance is sustainable.  
&gt;  
&gt;I, for one, am bullish. Arm’s customers have been willing to pay the higher royalty rates, meaning the boost from Armv9 is likely in the early stages. Further, Arm-based cloud server chips from Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, Nvidia, and others will likely generate robust revenue for years.  
&gt;  
&gt;Outside of Nvidia, Arm may be the best fundamental growth story in technology.

**Here are edited highlights from my conversation with Haas:**

&gt;Barron’s: Can you talk about Arm’s opportunities in the cloud server data center market. It looks like this business is starting to take off.  
&gt;  
&gt;When we were privatized, we had an opportunity to look at what to do with our investment dollars. With data centers, we noticed several things that we could do. If you want to put together processors, we were lacking a fabric \[to weave the network together\]. We were lacking certain extension instructions. So we designed CPUs with the right power profile, features, and performance.  
&gt;  
&gt;Then there was a bunch of work that needed to happen in the software ecosystem. The magic moment came when Red Hat announced their Linux distribution for Arm servers. It all came together.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Amazon saw it very early. Roughly half of Amazon’s AWS server additions are now Arm-based.**

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;We also changed our business model. In the past, it would have been crazy to think Arm would someday get paid $100 for each SoC \[system- on-a-chip\]. But that is what we are getting after we priced at 50 cents to $1 per core. If you put in 100 cores, **we are getting north of $100 on these SoCs.**  
&gt;  
&gt;What kind of demand are you seeing for the Nvidia GH200 Grace Hopper AI systems? In the last earnings report, you noted how the GH200 will run some of the most demanding AI applications in the world today.  
&gt;  
&gt;It’s very, very strong. Nvidia is pushing it very hard. What Nvidia has done with Grace Hopper is essentially taken 72 to 144 Arm CPU cores, and bolted it to an H100. **It replaces the x86 implementation. Nvidia has also done all the CUDA driver work for Arm-based CPUs. It’s great for us that Nvidia is shipping it.**  
&gt;  
&gt;What’s the impact to the business going from Armv8 to Armv9? I saw that Armv9 accounted for 15% of royalty revenue in the December quarter from 10% the prior quarter. Is that pace going to keep up?  
&gt;  
&gt;It is. A couple of things to keep in mind on v8 to v9. We’re going to see very, very fast adoption with v9. Everything that we do in servers is v9. It’s more power efficient and has a huge amount of security features.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Then in mobile, premium Android is mostly all v9.** Over the next couple of years, most Android smartphones will move that way. I expect the other alternative operating system on phones to go that way as well.  
&gt;  
&gt;Then you get into the economics. When we went from v7 to v8, **we doubled the royalty rates from about 1%-1.5% to 3%. On v8 to v9, we’ve doubled it again to 5% or close to 6%.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**It’s a huge tailwind for us in royalty growth.** We locked down those v9 contracts in 2020-2021, knowing that starting in 2023, they would start to kick in. Our confidence rate on the sustainability of that is quite high.  
&gt;  
&gt;Intel, under CEO Pat Gelsinger, has prioritized Intel Foundry—**to give the market an alternative to Taiwan Semiconductor.** How did it feel to be on the stage at Intel’s recent Foundry event, and what do you see from that partnership going forward?  
&gt;  
&gt;I think Intel has realized that for Intel Foundry to be successful, they were going to have to look at where Taiwan Semiconductor was shipping a lot of volume. **Intel Foundry executive Stu Pann said 80% of TSMC’s logic wafers have Arm in some shape or form. So partnering with Arm is table stakes for Intel to grow that business.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Quite candidly, when I came on board, it was a little chilly between the two companies. I had a lot of meetings with Pat Gelsinger after I started. **We came to a meeting of the minds that both companies would benefit, and more broadly, the ecosystem would benefit if we partnered closely.**  
&gt;  
&gt;They’ve been great. They’re spending a lot of engineering effort to make sure that the world’s best server chip based on Arm can be built on Intel’s manufacturing process. **On one level, that sounds kind of crazy, but they’re quite committed to it. We would love to see them be successful.**

**So let's recap all that BULLISH goodness.**

* Arm is making over $100 per SOC (System on Chip)
* Nvidia's most high end GPU's are going to be using 144 core ARM chips and ARM is getting paid per  Core
* x86-x64 is getting replaced writ large
* ARM V9 version 3 is just getting started with it's higher royalty rates going from 10% of total revenue to 15% in the previously reported quarter
* AWS and increasingly Azure are using ARM based servers in their data cloud offerings. More power per watt, cheaper and more efficient
* Android is mostly all V9
* Intel is getting friendly with ARM to fab it's chip production to compete with TSM and help out Intell in its continued success.
* ARM Is going into Robotics Next and New AI Edge Devices

- **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (log variance of daily gains) of the underlying asset and compare that to the current implied volatitlity (IV) of the option price. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium associated with the pricing of options (implied volatility).
    
- **Directional Bias:** Ranges from negative (bearish) to positive (bullish) and accounts for RSI, price trend, moving averages, and put/call skew over the past 6 weeks.

- **Priced Move:** given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move.

- **Expiration:** 2024-04-26.

- **Call/Put Premium:** How much extra you are paying for the implied move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean options are ""cheaper."" High numbers mean options are ""expensive.""

- **Efficiency:** This factor represents the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price of the option. It represents how much traders will pay in slippage with a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.

224,TSM,The NVDA/SMCI/AMD/etc. bubble is likely to grow a lot more,"In previous weeks, we would see incredible buying in afterhours on the semi-conductor stocks, specifically SMCI, but all of them really. Then, this last week, this red week, we would still see buying in afterhours giving some hope for a recovery, to then again have sell-offs at open. This behavior fits the repositioning of large institutional investors who still have a lot of demand, but do not want to inflate the price too much. 

So, how does this behavior fit the repositioning of large institutional investors who still have a lot of demand for these semi-conductor stocks? Why is an observation on such behavior accompanied by a larger likelihood for the reason that these institutional investors are repositioning and still have demand?

Firstly, when large institutional investors buy a lot of a certain stock during after hours, this inflates the stock price due to lower liquidity. Then, secondly, if the large institutional investors sell off a lot of their shares of this stock at market demand when the market opens, they can sell them for the relatively higher price as the stock won't drop as much as it would have when they sold those shares in afterhours. There is more liquidity in regular trading hours.

Thus, they make a profit. That profit is not huge, but allows the strategy to be sustainable. Because, the real goal of the strategy is to influence the market to sell off as well. Upon seeing those incredible heights reached in afterhours or premarket, people get nervous, and then when a large drop happens at open, some of the nervous ones will sell off. Therefore, not only will they turn a slight profit, but new shares will become available to them at lower prices as well. The stock price will drop to a point where the large institutional investors can safely enter a large position again during regular trading hours, which then does not inflate the stock price as much due to the higher liquidity. Then, when regular trading ends, they inflate the price again, sell off again, etc. As a result, the institutional investors are able to increase their position size relative to the rest of the world while holding the price somewhat stable. Given that shares of big names are often owned mostly by large corporations like BlackRock, it would make sense for them to manipulate the market in this legal way so that they can gain similarly large positions in stocks which are approaching those big names.

However, that does mean that at some point, the weak hands will be shaken and those shares will be in their pockets; the aftermarket strategy will not work any more, and any buying they do from that point onwards will inflate the current bubble even more. For these reasons, I believe the poppening won't happen for a long time. Diamond hands baby.

To answer this we have to visit a part of the investing world rarely talked about, but foundational in it's role to stocks, ""vAluAtiOn"". This on paper is as boring as it sounds, but I can make it really simple for you, here's how people decide what a stock is worth.

Let's say Jpow brings a new product to the market, money printer *lite\*\***^(tm)*, a personal edition that prints 1 dollar every day for the foreseeable future. The question is, how much does he sell it for? Think about that for a second, it's actually kind of mind blowing. This phenomenon is what we call the time value of money. Is the value of it infinite? Not really because we don't live infinitely so what use is that to us? Perhaps it's worth how much it can print for an average 80year life span? nah because if I paid that amount I don't recoup my investment till I'm dead.

The way we answer it is this little beauty right here

https://preview.redd.it/riau11npawnc1.jpg?width=2880&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=164d1d79734781057e138138b3ac2a2a8fc4d3a2

This is the discounted cash flow model, I won't go too in depth with math, but it is one of the primary tools investors that are actually moving the share price use to give a stock it's price. What it says is that something's present value today, is worth the sum of it's discounted future cash flows (the money it prints). How does this not say the money printer is worth infinite dollars if it's cash flows are infinite? The key is the discounting part.

Why are we giving a discount to our cash flows? because they're not the only one, like a store putting an item on sale to make it more attractive over others, we do the same. First of all our money gets devalued at 2% (theoretically lol) per year, so that printer's dollar in 2052 won't be worth near as much. Second, instead of buying the money printer, is there other assets we could buy that print money? Duh, equities and bonds. let's say they can return between 5-10% per year, these are our discounts, so the money printer would be priced so that whatever you pay for it now up front, it will give you a similar amount of money back in the future as those other low/no risk assets.

Stocks are like that money printer. They are companies that each year make money (sometimes), their current value is the sum of all this future money, but all in comparison or discounted to the money anyone could make with low/no risk assets. Historically this was the treasury bond because it's considered THE risk free asset, but recently investor's have weighted volatile tech stocks against the overall market, which returns give or take 8-10% a year, if a stock is going to grow less than 8-10% per year it's share price will drop so that an investment at it's current price becomes an equal return to the market, and vice versa if it will grow more.

If it's so concrete then why do stocks move so violently? With our money printer we could get a very easy valuation because it's future cash flows are known 100% (this is why the bond market is priced so efficiently, they are assets that have known cash flows, only the discount rate changes) But a stock is different, that's a company that has millions of factors acting on it's ability to make money, and it changes all the time. so the future cash flows of a company are only investor's best educated guess at what they will be. In the last few months investors have realized that NVidia cash flows will probably be a lot higher than they initially thought, A LOT higher, so naturally the share price reflects this.

[With a growth rate of 20&amp;#37; for the next 15 years, we can actually get Nvidia's current price.](https://preview.redd.it/0gq2aepakwnc1.png?width=841&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1994371e0d284a10fc85fe983694be5b479dac24)

&amp;#x200B;

[lowering the discount rate \(market return\) gives us a higher valuation](https://preview.redd.it/czvao81ikwnc1.png?width=851&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f1673a9013921d895149b527f5d73233b503ac6)

&amp;#x200B;

[lowering the growth rate makes it theoretically overvalued](https://preview.redd.it/oz2aissnkwnc1.png?width=843&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad3f78a4a56d9dc12a11bd1a7855efa6f13d11b5)

Does this mean markets are efficient? A great book by economist Robert Shiller showed stocks are way too volatile to be explained by the efficient market hypothesis (what we mean when we say ""priced in""), and with NVidia, investors could be way overshooting with their growth rates, if they came out next earnings and gave lowered guidance it would sink like a stone because investors got too carried away with their estimates.

This explains why for any stock the guidance is usually what makes big drops or pops, it's all about how much money the company *will* make. That's why a biotech company can rally 500% in a day upon FDA approval , because it went from making no money for the foreseeable future to probably making boatloads.

Of course I didn't get into terminal growth rates, how investors determine their growth rates, how you would value a company that doesn't yet turn a profit, how risk factors effect future cash flows, and a million other things, take a course on finance for that, it's way out of the scope of this already boring long post. Just remember, if you know a stock will progressively make more money than is currently being forecasted, **the line will go up**, however, you are very very very unlikely to determine that against wall st.

- **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (log variance of daily gains) of the underlying asset and compare that to the current implied volatitlity (IV) of the option price. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium associated with the pricing of options (implied volatility).
    
- **Directional Bias:** Ranges from negative (bearish) to positive (bullish) and accounts for RSI, price trend, moving averages, and put/call skew over the past 6 weeks.

- **Priced Move:** given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move.

- **Expiration:** 2024-04-26.

- **Call/Put Premium:** How much extra you are paying for the implied move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean options are ""cheaper."" High numbers mean options are ""expensive.""

- **Efficiency:** This factor represents the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price of the option. It represents how much traders will pay in slippage with a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.

I’m here to discuss the investing advice I’ve got from my father, whom works in a banking firm as a manager of some sort. I’m currently in the compulsory national service in my country and am getting around 1k USD each month. I’ve talked with him and his advice boils down to either buying individual stocks that I am confident in / or 50-50 in ETF/index funds such as SPY, QQQ ,and individual stocks like AMZN, MSFT, AMD, TSM. 

He did tell me what I should choose from the two should also be determined by my risk appetite, asking if I’m the type to lose sleep at night if my stocks don’t well.

I’m here to discuss with you guys to get some perspective on the advice given and how you look at it. I’m not here asking on what I should be doing but just here to talk and have others opinions and look at this advice from a bigger perspective.

235,TSM,$TSM Stands for The Stonk Machine,"Whats up my fellow degens, I hope your weekend is going well. I had tendies for dinner, and I hope you did too. 

Disclaimer, this post is full of my opinions. I encourage you to make your own, you have a brain, hopefully, so use it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've started to notice that some of you regards will go all in on a shit show of a stonk like bbai and soun when they're up 2-3x in a week, you have absolutely no idea what they do, and never heard of the company until tomorrow. But fuck it, we ball. Someone told you to buy that bitch so we in it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then a real company comes along, enter $TSM. Possibly one of the most critical companies to our modern day society. They make \~60% of all chips in the world and \~90% of advanced chips (smaller process nodes) based on last estimates that I saw. They are the dominating force behind the manufacturing (fab) of the majority of the worlds chips. Top customers like Apple, Nvidia, AMD, the list goes on. It doesn't matter who the flavor of the week is in the semi world, TSM will always have the orders flowing through them to do the actual fab. They go up 10 percent in a week, drop 2 percent on Friday and some of yall freak the fuck OUT. ITS THE END. ITS A PUMP AND DUMP. FUCKKKKKKKKK. Its 10 percent up for the week, chill the fuck out. Its a 2 percent pull back, chill the fuck out. 

&amp;#x200B;

The fact is that most companies aren't ""chip makers"" as people call them. They are really ""chip designers"" (yea, looking at you Nvidia). That's just the way it works in the semiconductor industry. These companies are the face, they design and sell chips, but without TSM they are effectively nothing. TSM is the chip maker. Yea, there are others of course - but TSM is leaps ahead and everyone else is just trying to catch up. That's how its been.

&amp;#x200B;

The design of semiconductors is nothing to scoff at. But the fab of these chips is where the real complexity is at. There is a reason that most all companies decide to outsource this process. The capital requirements, ramp time, and expertise required is 10 fold difficulty compared to hiring some designers to make a chip with a pretty case. There's no reason to compete. Have an expert make your chip for you with all their expensive, fancy equipment, and slap your brand on the top. TSM is that expert. 

&amp;#x200B;

The world has a fixed capacity to manufacture chips, and TSM controls the vast majority of that capacity.

&amp;#x200B;

**Pros:** 

* Dominating force behind the actual fabrication of the majority of all chips in the world. Everything from semiconductors in your toaster, computer, to tens or hundreds that go in your car. 
* Solid monthly revenue in Jan/Feb (7.9% and 11.3% YoY increase respectively)
* Nvidia conference this month will likely give them more visibility and a further boost
* Increased semiconductor demand from most companies means more demand for TSM. Not specifically dependent on one customer or sector to do well. Generally semi demand goes up, TSM gets more orders. 
* Expecting the US chips act beneficiaries to be announced this month, and they are likely going to receive multi billion dollars ($5B?) to further develop manufacturing capacity within the US. 
* Quarterly earnings on 4/18 will most likely look decent, and more importantly they will probably have a killer outlook based on orders coming in from top customers (Apple, Nvidia, AMD, ...) for the next few years due to the booming AI hardware needs that all come back to, you guessed it, TSM. 
* In 4 years their monthly revenue has \~doubled. Its public information go look at 2020 revenue for Jan/Feb vs 2024. In general you will see their revenue is constantly booming as a general trend. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Cons:** 

* Your wife's boyfriend said it was stupid.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Some common Q&amp;A and Concerns:**  
**Concern:** B..But what about China! Id rather invest in Nvidia and play it safe!

**A:** Nvidia, and many others will collapse into a fraction of what they are today. What is a chip designer without an advanced fab partner? Will you buy cool pictures and schematics from NVidia of things they could make if only they had fab facilities? Will you buy their awesome IP and patents? Put that piece of paper in your PC and see how fast it will render. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Q:** B...But what about China! TSM will collapse if that happens!

**A:** Yea, so will the broader stock market. So will most semi stonks. So will the sky when bombs start dropping. We got bigger shit to worry about if that were to happen. The impact of this (unlikely event) being specific to TSM is far overblown. Every piece of tech produced today will become highly less available, and prices of anything with chips would skyrocket. TSM also has Fab locations around the world, not just in Taiwan. My understanding is that more of the advanced fab is kept in Taiwan (smaller process nodes), but they are in the process of expanding, including in the US. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Q:** B.....But TSM is way overvalued! 

**A:** Is it? TSM is quite possibly the most valuable company in today's technological society that most people never heard of and are just becoming aware of. This company is trading around 20-30PE ratio range and is over valued? Ok lets go buy more BBAI instead so we dont get rekt. Oof, too soon? Go look at the PE ratio of half the companies you invest in and come back to me. In my opinion TSM could have a 2T market cap and not be over valued. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Q:** B.....But TSM is gonna have the rug pulled!

**A:** What fucking rug? TSM is up 60% in the past year. QQQ is up 46%. Its slightly outperforming QQQ and its barely breached its previous ATH by around 15% increase (back in 2021 - 2022 timeframe). There is no fucking rug. TSM is the concrete foundation that the rugs are set on. It's always there even when those shitty rugs get pulled out from under you to hold your stupid ass up.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Q:** B.......But TSM will crash at earnings!

**A:** Will it? Will a company who is getting dramatically increased orders for semiconductor fab due to a spike in AI hardware demand have a slower year? Forget about the drastic increase in AI hardware, they always have more demand and expansions. Look at what they have done, and what they are doing today. They are expanding capacity and revenue all the time. They are doing nothing but becoming more and more dominate. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Q:** B.....But semiconductor manufacturing capacity is booked way ahead of time. Things move slow!

**A:** Yea, so what the hell do you think these companies are doing now? they are booking for the coming years with their expected boom in AI demand so they can have TSM capacity reserved now, and in the future. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR:

Dig deep, get your fucking balls out of your wife's boyfriends purse, and buy $TSM because this bitch isn't a fucking pump and dump. It's just getting started. If you think slightly outperforming QQQ is a pump and dump, you probably have PTSD from your mom getting pumped and dumped, don't take that shit out on $TSM. Go buy more BBAI calls where you belong. 

* $TSM Good
* $TSM Has a ton of room to run
* $TSM runs the world

236,TSM,What you should know before investing in TSMC,"TSMC is the backbone of almost every chip company in the USA, if not all. It is severly undervalued because of the geopolitical risk of China invading Taiwan. What you shouldn't worry about is them invading Taiwan but what our government speaks out about to Taiwan. Just by the Chinese President Pooh Bear's word of mouth about Taiwan's reunification with China would tumble Taiwanese stocks. The plan here is to buy calls all the way up until Election (Unforseen non-priced in election that kind of decided Taiwan's fate)   


Why buy calls on TSMC?   
As all of you know TSMC makes chips and their year over year revenue has exponentially increased, and they release earnings next month, April 19 and wouldn't need to make alot more to beat expectations based on their monthly revenue they post.

Bullish signs for next week- Talks of 5 Billion contract in Arizona, Investors will be buying back Monday's market since everyone sold this Friday, Monthly Revenue should boost the stock although it already did but the Friday sell-off came through.  


Potential Bearish signs for next week- CPI inflation report Tuesday 3/12/24  


Positions: Dumped my entire Brokerage portfolio into TSMC calls hoping I'll catch enough gains to fund my college   


TLDR: TSMC is very cool and I have auTSM and I'll never sell!!!!

238,TSM,When I plan to sell all my $NVDA,"So these are my thoughts. Monday we have Oracle earnings and then no other big AI/Semiconductor related earnings for a while. Nvidia has their GTC event next weekend but what after that? I'm hyped about what they will have in store and I think the AI train is here to stay for years to come but in the short term (1.5 months) I think Nvidia will start to fall and then crash after the GTC event. Regardless of what they announce, I don't think it will matter because it is priced in with the forward PE and the projected growth. I think there will be a time to buy back before $TSM earnings on 4/18 or a few weeks after. Long term bullish, short term bear.

Position: 25 shares (sold 57 shares Friday) and a 20Jun25 250c I bought March 15th 2023, up 56k on the call but I plan to sell after the 15th for long term capital gains.",572,300,1709992108.0,2024-03-09T13:48:28+00:00,t3_1bai4nb,wallstreetbets

240,TSM,"Was hoping for a discount on TSM, god listened too early and made it happen next day","Fellow regards!

I posted a few days ago showing my 7k position in TSM calls for their upcoming quarterly earnings on April 18th. Since I built my position TSM has ran up a lot and I was sitting comfortably at a 250% gain. But, I wished to add more to my position. I hoped for it to go down, so I could double down and go full regard into these calls. God listened, but alas too early! It fell from its peak at 158.4 to 145, almost a 10% drop. Taking full advantage of this discount I went full regard and added a lot of positions today. I added a few LEAPS, as well as ultra risky 220c that were open just today. Also added some 200, 210c today (who is pussy enough to but ATM, OTM calls? Only deep OTM calls for gainz🤑). 

So, what do you guys think of it? Not sure if I'll be adding any more to this position its already 20% of my portfolio for now. Will depend on how much my other calls print so I could move money around. Also, should I roll over my 200 and 220c from April into June with same/lower SP?",81,39,1709943505.0,2024-03-09T00:18:25+00:00,t3_1ba3x24,wallstreetbets

243,TSM,ALL ABOARD - TSM &amp; NVDA,"Just bought the dip for TSM and NVDA. First time locking in NVDA calls apart from Feb (which was nothing - find attached). 

WHY TSM:

- TSM’s gov contract should give a nice pop next week 
- reliance of industry on it will only build it up to a fair valuation 
- AI BOOM WILL KEEP BOOMIN’

WHY NVDA:
- it’s nividia. current is too large to swim against.

Positions:
TSM: $160 4/19C +4
NVDA: $950 3/22C +1

Worries:
- retail investors are known to get screwed over at any possible moment, so it does seem unreal that very obvious and vocal plays through this server will play out to be true for everyone (too good to be true like we saw with COST and MRVL). however, NVDA SMCI and more have been pushing the past couple months so anything is possible! half my account is riding on these trades
- nothing is guaranteed, so the bubble / hype can pop at any time

- **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (log variance of daily gains) of the underlying asset and compare that to the current implied volatitlity (IV) of the option price. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium associated with the pricing of options (implied volatility).
    
- **Directional Bias:** Ranges from negative (bearish) to positive (bullish) and accounts for RSI, price trend, moving averages, and put/call skew over the past 6 weeks.

- **Priced Move:** given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move.

- **Expiration:** 2024-04-19.

- **Call/Put Premium:** How much extra you are paying for the implied move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean options are ""cheaper."" High numbers mean options are ""expensive.""

- **Efficiency:** This factor represents the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price of the option. It represents how much traders will pay in slippage with a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.

- **E.R.:** Days unitl the next Earnings Release. This feature is still in beta as we work on a more complete list of earnings dates.

- **Why isn't my stock on this list?** It doesn't have ""weeklies"", the underlying is ""too cheap"", or the options markets are too illiquid (open interest) to qualify for this strategy. 480 underlyings are used in this report and only the top results end up passing the criteria for each filter.",18,1,1709910015.0,2024-03-08T15:00:15+00:00,t3_1b9q0pr,thetagang

I’m sure you have all used chatGPT , it’s already better than whole teams of people who compile and analyze reports, make project plans, outlines, etc. What would take a team of employees to do in a month, AI does in minutes.

AI will replace call centers, maybe not this year, but with everyday improvements, AI will be the single most important part of any business. It’s smarter, more patient, and doesn’t just have to specialize in one area, and can handle multiple calls. Right now just the major players are piling in. The frenzy to get AI to replace a part of their workforce hasn’t arrived , and it will. And when it does growth in AI will explode.

Example if I bought AMD and TSM for 6 months out.... and next week they start running. Should I cash out, and reinvest with that larger sum from gains (if gains happen), or do you find it grows better if it is left alone until closer to expiration?

I have only around 5k USD left, I have been unemployed since 5 months due to tech market and I dont have any choice left, either I go all in at this point or disappear quietly.

Here is my plan, according to the research I have done, for this ""bubble"" to peak, we need to see %3000 or similar growth in a short time in many stocks, looking at what happened during dot-com.

Some of the research you can see in this video, there is data on dot-com to compare: Write this to youtube to watch the video (""E7: NVIDIA AI BUBBLE - We Can't Stay Quiet Any Longer""). I didnt want to post the link

My targets:  
NVDA to 2500 or above. (I would even say 4000 for this one but I am taking it softer)

SMCI to 4000 or around.

AMD to 2000 or above  (this is the real deal because I think AMD will ramp up competition against NVDA. This would make AMD around 3 Trillion company)

AVGO to 2000 or above

SMH to 500 or above

AMAT to 500 or around.

TSM to 300 or above

Coming days I will be posting my positions. Wish me good luck. I will start adding more after CPI data on March 12 because I am expecting CPI to come hotter therefore it might give a good opportunity to enter into some of these stocks

EDIT 1: Since I promised to post some positions, I will post some. Now I have 3 calls on TSMC. 25 CFD contracts on NVDA, and 20 on AMD. Once they go up a bit, I am planning to transition all positions into call options, cuz you know what? Fuck CFDs. I have a romantic relationship with AMD that I cannot explain, I am planning to go big on that one. TSMC 200 C expires on 28 March.

EPS: declining, Profits: declining, Revenue: declining. All deciding factors are going fishing down the toilet bowl. Which means they gonna take a dump. Sure they may still be green and beat earnings by a small margin, yes. but that doesn't matter since guidance is what decides the fate. I'm going puts, to each their own though. Screw that I had to sign DOCUsign shit 30 times when applying for college grants and they ran into some authentication errors which screwed up my grants??? Fuck them. Short the bastard.

Disclaimer: these guys tend to move a day or two after earnings. So only take something ATM, or just OTM.

there is no pattern. Up, down, up down, fucking forklift. One thing I do ses is that they were/are red but the slowly moving into green. Which is effectively good guidance and hence, stonk go brrr. They're receiving subsidies and what not. Actual AI users and are doing real AI shit and not some random bumfuck name with a .ai tag (yes SOUn and BBAI, looking at you).

Why do i think it will go up even tho the charts aren't great per se? Mainly because semiconductors weren't as much as a hotshot in the past quarters. But this time. MY GOD. You name it, it's flying. Chip manufacturers are on a roll and MRVL is no different. NVDA for GPUs, AMD/INTC for CPUs, ICs, MRVL for switches, IC components. this is how it is. They're getting in the big leagues. Should just follow NVDA's path.

This is more like a sentiment play rather than ER play but well, if it makes you bags, who cares, right?

265,TSM,The case to move on from NVDA and AMD (long term),"There are times when I read about GPU makers here and I'm wondering if any of you have ever tried renting GPU by the hour or week or month for AI purposes in the past 2 years? If so have you ever calculated how much you're being charged per FLOP or in general the direction of the price of raw compute? As AI becomes mainstream and inference demand grows, what do you think happens to the basic laws of supply and demand?

&amp;#x200B;

I was in the data center business (aka HPC) until end of last year and I can tell you that pricing for Nvidia A100 rental had compressed by 70% over the last 2 years. The only reason you're seeing all these great GPU sales is because of 2 things: AI compute demand exploded, and greedy mofo distributors have been hording GPUs - yeah you heard me. I used to sell container loads of servers equipped with various GPUs like the A100, and then H100 purchased from the spot market (we do not have the volume to deal with Nvidia directly), and I've seen warehouses full of these GPUs sitting there waiting for the highest bidder. The only way Nvidia (or AMD for that matter) distributors get their discounts and priority is by placing huge orders. While you hear about big news of TSLA or AMZN buying a few billions worth of GPUs from NVDA, significant chunk of their GPU business is distributed by companies you've never heard of and made into complete systems via companies like SMCI. If you own the supply and you restrict the supply on the street, what will happen to the price on the street? There's a warehouse in Yokohama that I've been to that was floor to ceiling in tens of thousands of boxes of GPUs, waiting for the highest bidder.

&amp;#x200B;

Smuggling is also hugely profitable, not that my company ever did that, but we did have a ball selling overpriced A100s to Saudi Arabia before that was banned by the State Dept. However, the story goes that there's a vibrant and profitable smuggling business between Taiwan and China (where the most advanced GPUs are banned) via the Kinmen Islands which is only a few miles away from mainland China. Google Kinmen and you'll see there's been this brouhaha over 2 dead ""fishermen"" from the TWCG chasing and then hitting the ""fishing boat"" (that has FOUR huge outboard engines made for speed) and causing the boat to capsize and killing 2 of 4 ""fishermen"". Coincidence that none of the TWCG law enforcement personnel had their bodycams turned on, and rumor goes that TWCG is actually the biggest smuggler of them all. Why not? A few boxes here and there ""fall off the truck"" by TSM's loading dock and gets picked up by a non-descript van. Anyone ever looked at NVDA sales volume in Taiwan vs. its meager population? Yes they export a lot of that in the form of finished systems, but even the State Dept can't keep track of everything - there are plenty of ways to fudge the numbers, including TSM yield rates on ""defective"" GPUs.

&amp;#x200B;

While TSLA, GOOG, MSFT, AMZN, META can all get their hands on the high end GPUs directly at great discounts, why do you think they also invest heavily in their own AI chip development using RISC-V or ARM? Why do you think companies like Tenstorrent has gotten so much press over the past 12 months around their open RISC-V ecosystem designed for general AI and compute?

&amp;#x200B;

Ah but what do I know, I'm just a permabear regard (according to some) and I have no idea when this Jenga game will end. Enjoy the moonshot while it lasts, and congrats to all who profited hugely on NVDA, DELL, and SMCI the last few weeks.

35,TSM,300k Account Wheel Update - Month 17,"Hello everyone!

This is the Feb 2024 monthly update. Previous months update can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/1ahdfh1/16_month_wheel_update_300k_account/).

In February of 2024 I closed 17 trades with an average hold time of 8 days to collect $4,810 in premiums. Earnings season went well, saw many companies shoot up quickly after reporting. This led to some of my positions being closed within 1 or 2 days giving my average hold time a huge boost this month. I probably could have been more aggressive but I continue to stay conservative only looking for returns of around 15% annualized. I'm happy with the performance this month. I still have $250k in SGOV so if a pullback ever comes I'm ready to take advantage.

Below are the trades I closed in Feb 2024.

My total **realized** profits after 17 months is $109,400 and I have $4,100 in unrealized **gains**.

**This brings my NET profit to $113,500. This equates to a 37.8% gain on the initial 300k I started with. QQQ is up 48% and SPY is up 28% in the same time frame.** 

I did a good job keeping up with the QQQ this past month as both are up roughly 5%, however it is still outperforming over the past 17 months. I'm happy to be outperforming SPY over the same time frame. I do believe if there is any volatility or broad market pullbacks I'll be able to catch up to the QQQ and outperform. The goal isn't to outperform on any given year though, but to return a consistent 10-20% yearly gain. So far my annualized rate of return over the past 17 months is 25% which I am very happy with.

Below is the P&amp;L statement for my account and all current positions.

274,TSM,"Nvidia has peaked, time for Warner Bros","🚀🚀🚀🚀

Let’s analyze the S&amp;P 500’s best performer, and their worst. 

I truly think NVDA is as great of a company as they say. That’s why I invested at $150 a share when they were down off crypto (couldn’t hold it as it went down to $120 and I was full ported $6k in shares on margin, I do belong here I’m not the best at dip buying). I just think the other semiconductor companies like TSM haven’t yet enjoyed the catch up growth, and we’ll soon find that NVIDIA’s moat is not as big they say it is.

In any case, WBD is now down ~90% due to the combo of the possible death of cable, theaters, the strikes, the (now reduced) debt etc and it’s had their investors depressed like those longing BlackBerry, but me entirely seeing dollar signs because they have the one streaming platform that can by itself face off against Netflix and Disney’s offerings (who have been doing great), a streaming platform which somehow beat Disney and Hulu to profitability this last quarter.

Not to mention, the release of Sora AI should drastically lower the cost of film production. I hear them say $30 million is a small budget for an animated film? Psssh…. uh, buddy, Dall E charges $0.04 a picture, that’s ~$4,500 for the number of frames in Toy Story. Where are you getting your frames. 

Anyways Sora is developed by OpenAI, which recently worked out a deal with CNN, Warner Bros’ subsidiary, for training data for GPT:

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-10/openai-in-talks-with-cnn-fox-and-time-to-license-content

Which by the way, should be telling of what’s to come. A sufficiently large library of training data is required for all AI to achieve performance. For LLM’s like GPT, that’s well written text. For image AI like Dall E, that’s well composed pictures and art. For video AI like Sora, I imagine it’ll be well composed video content. Specifically, pre ai-tainted data, as we’ve found AI in AI training data taints the batch: https://bdtechtalks.com/2023/07/17/llm-data-contamination/amp/

Where am I going with this? Well obviously as OpenAI is facing lawsuits due to using copyrighted data for training, they’re increasingly realizing they’ll have to pay to license that valuable data, as they are with Warner Bros at CNN.

And who has the largest (pre-AI) library of owned,  well composed professional video content in one place? (Alongside evaluation ratings data for said video content)

Disney and Warner Bros.

I don’t know if they realize it, but those two likely have the highest potential for firm ownership or licensing for higher quality performance video AI models. I heard Zaslav though is a cable obsessed old head so he might need to be swayed by a more modern tech affiliated type to realize this.

This is why I also support the possible merger with Paramount, that sinking ship, even though it’ll result in possible short term debt/chaos, as they say that’ll include DreamWorks and a generally large enough media library to match Disney no question if they don’t have that already. Plus I think Zaszlav seems like he can handle debt. Owning the most pre-ai media content will soon be king.

Anyways, just my thoughts. Sora AI comes out this year and already exists so the paradigm shift is happening. If it can make even 50% of the movie frames pre-photoshop, it’ll be wild. WBD moon 🚀🚀 etc

EDIT: Sora transition shot video: https://youtu.be/TAflTfPckQs?si=tEFHP6y3VEFoeDYj

EDIT 2: Tech companies in particular are often valued for the quality of their data. The simple explanation is this: if I have superior data for instance of your internet traffic, I can make a trading AI that trades superior to the market and you. This is a real tactic employed I won’t say where. Superior data = superior AI performance. For these reasons, data is like Silicon Valley gold, in case you want to know why Google hates your privacy. Conveniently enough, I was an AI Specialist at one of the big tech companies you guys talk about here I won’t say which one. Recently laid off, which is why I lately have the time for this post.

In any case, if I had to pick one asset to own if I was a machine learning engineer tasked to develop a model to compete with Sora, I’d pick Warner Bros no contest with their 12,500+ well made films, labeled by production, and tens of thousands of tv shows, etc.

Disney could do well too, with their well stored 6,500,000+ art pieces for their media, however I know for a fact their video content and data skews family friendly. Which might mess up your AI generated concept broody Viking or War film for making it look too much like Frozen. For the more varied and diverse data all in one place, I’d definitely say Warner Bros wins no question.",372,269,1709231067.0,2024-02-29T18:24:27+00:00,t3_1b37byx,wallstreetbets

With every company using their production line obviously they will have good quarters this year and next.

1. TSM is currently building out a Plant in Kumamoto scheduled to open Q4.  This will obviously get some upside into 2025. Unless there is a glut of chips, A.I. gets boring, or China does something.

3. With All the A.I. talk don't miss out on the manufacturing side.
4. TSM is building a factory in Arizona starting production early in 2025. Meaning 2nd QTR 2025 Sales Will Increase.

6. LEAPS are about $10-$20
7. China Invasion Fears: Though war is possible but stupid in China's case. TSM will likely disable then entire plant. 

With all these catalyst not priced in Currently, the plants being completed, increased sales from increased production output and more traders in the Tech space as A.I. improves and funds seek out value. 

I think buy 3rd QTR 2025 we could see $250-$300 Which is a $7000-$11000 in profit.

Following the infallible investment strategy of going all-in on a hype-beast stock when it's at ATH - I took my hard-earned 25k and bought the March 1 1040 Calls on SMCI and watched my money evaporate. Yes, it wasn't as bad as the 70k 0DTE guy, but I think I have outperformed his ability to time the market.

Buying my calls at several different levels, I accepted an average somewhere in the range of $84.30. In shock at the immediacy of my loss, I accepted that the stock would never recover in time, and waited for the absolute bottom to come in so that I could close my position for a $23,000 loss.

\- Only to watch as it started to climb almost immediately after my sale and continue to do so all the way until market close. Guys, I timed the absolute top of this run and closed for as large of a loss as I possibly could. I am absolutely cursed and will live out my days knowing exactly what level of self-sabotage I am able to inflict upon myself.

Closer to - 0.020 for SPY, TLT, IWM 

I don't sell them all at once .. I typically sell 2 or 3 a day .

These are governed by  a combination price drop,  50 , 100, 200 day EMA .

I typically manage to sell about 15  to 16 K worth of puts annually , using IBKR margin .

So that's a return of 15 percent.

279,TSM,"NVDIA, TSLA, TSM, PLTR, SMCI and QQQ","

Hello regards, after the crazy market session with SMCI loosing the $1k level , and with NVDIA ER coming to play next week, I saw lots of posts with probable moves on PLTR, TSM, SMCI and others.

Since IV is quit high for options play in SMCI and NVDIA, if the prices tanked we will not see Put or Call gains. However some regards sugested to go with QQQ, trying to capture the NVDIA movement, I did some charts and from my regardness ( I cant read candles, only YOLO charts), my points are summarized bellow:

1. TSLA:  There is a likelihood that TSLA can be rebound if the market start to sell-of NVDIA after the ER. The chart shows migration from TSLA to NVDIA in January.

2. QQQ : seems does not capture the moves of NVDIA, by the chart presented.

3. PLTR: keep the same NVDIA moviment, if one goes down the other goes too...

4.TSM: looks like after Feb/07 investors also have migrate to NVDIA. But TSM also can follow the NVDIA's patterns post ER.

5. SMCI: this crazy rocket since Jan/17 has it own move ...and the NVDIA results or moves can affect only by fear of wich were happened to SMCI (my gues, I am not an expert).

Any thoughts? Something that I missed or my ape brain could not figure out ?

Disclaymer : I have positions in MSFT and AAPL - calls and both are red :(), Put on COIN and Put on CSCO.

But I am considering buying some Calls on TSLA for DTE 03/15, Put on PLTR and TSM.

TLDR: If NVDIA hit the wall after ER, PLTR seems to follow also SMCI, however TSLA has small chance of rebound, since the migration can be reversed after NVDIA ER.",30,26,1708215693.0,2024-02-18T00:21:33+00:00,t3_1atgr9x,wallstreetbets

 Nvidia's Valuation Sparks Reddit Debate: Echoes Of Apple's Innovation, Cisco's Challenges 11:12 am ET February 12, 2024 (Benzinga) Print The technology sector has always been a hot topic for investors, and Reddit is buzzing with discussions about NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and its potential trajectory. While trading at high TTM P/E valuations of 95, Nvidia stock is a Buy based on analyst ratings consensus. 

Redditor u/waterlimes sparked a conversation by drawing parallels between Nvidia and Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO), raising concerns about the company’s high P/E ratio of around 95. This article explores the various perspectives shared by the Reddit community and evaluates whether Nvidia, with its impressive growth in the chip and AI markets, is still a wise investment. Also Read: Nvidia On The Rise, ChatGPT’s Secret Sauce And AI Cracks Ancient Code: This Week In Artificial Intelligence Nvidia’s Technological Advancements And Adaptability 

Competitive Landscape: User normal\_gouy pointed out the key reason Cisco lost ground was the ease with which competitors could replicate their products. However, in the case of Nvidia, the complexity of GPUs and Tegra devices makes replication more challenging. The consensus is that Nvidia’s products are intricate, giving them a competitive advantage that might persist for a considerable period. 

Versatility and Innovation: Normal\_gouy countered the comparison to Cisco, emphasizing Nvidia’s versatility as a company. The sentiment is that Nvidia is agile and adaptable. If a new technology emerges, Nvidia is likely to explore and capitalize on it. The comparison to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) highlights how companies that continually innovate can thrive despite potential challenges. 

Advanced Technology Differentiation: Astronaut100 dismissed the comparison with Cisco, stating that Nvidia’s technological advancements surpass anything Cisco ever accomplished. The consensus is that Nvidia’s capabilities in AI and GPU technology make it a unique and advanced player in the industry. 

Consideration of PE Ratio and Industry Dynamics: 3LevelACDF addressed the concerns over the company’s P/E ratio, arguing that it may not be the best metric for evaluating a growth stock like Nvidia, especially when its revenue increased by 200% in the last quarter. The cyclical nature of the chip industry and the potential for oversupply were acknowledged, but the immediate demand for Nvidia’s chips and its impressive revenue growth were emphasized. Concerns Regarding Technology Shifts And Supply Chain Dependencies 

Technology Shift Risk: TimeTravelingChris introduced the risk that Nvidia might face, not from direct competition, but from a shift in technology that could render their current chip offerings obsolete for AI applications. The uncertainty of when such a shift might occur leaves investors on edge. The advice is to monitor earnings reports closely and observe any signs of flattening EPS growth. 

Supply Chain Dependency Concerns: POPnotSODA\_ expressed concerns about Nvidia’s dependence on external suppliers like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (NYSE:TSM) for chip fabrication. The lack of local manufacturing capabilities raises worries about potential disruptions in the supply chain, emphasizing the need for Nvidia to secure its chip production. 

 Competition and Market Dynamics: GongTzu drew parallels between Nvidia and Cisco in terms of market dynamics. Predicting that competition will catch up, GongTzu highlighted the cyclical nature of hardware-related industries. The anticipation is that prices will eventually decrease as new competitors enter the market, and Nvidia’s dominance might be challenged. While concerns about technology shifts, supply chain dependencies, and potential market saturation exist, many from the Reddit community acknowledge Nvidia’s current dominance and technological prowess. The consensus seems to be that Nvidia is well-positioned for the near future, but investors should stay vigilant and monitor industry trends for signs of potential challenges. As always, investing in stocks involves risk, and each investor should carefully consider their risk tolerance and conduct thorough research before making any decisions ",24,14,1707756565.0,2024-02-12T16:49:25+00:00,t3_1ap4ig5,wallstreetbets

25,TSM,Nvidia chases $30 billion custom chip market with new unit,"Nvidia NVDA  is building a new business unit focused on designing bespoke chips for  cloud computing firms and others, including advanced artificial  intelligence processors, according to nine sources familiar with the  company's plans.

The dominant global designer and  supplier of AI chips aims to capture a portion of an exploding market  for custom AI chips and to protect itself from the growing number of  companies interested in finding alternatives to its products.

The  Santa Clara, California-based company currently controls about 80% of  the market for high-end AI chips, a position that has sent its market  value up 40% so far this year to $1.73 trillion after it more than  tripled in 2023.

Its customers, which include ChatGPT creator OpenAI, Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOG and Meta Platforms META, have raced to snap up the dwindling supply of Nvidia chips to compete in the rapidly emerging generative AI sector.

Nvidia's  H100 and A100 chips serve as a generalized, all-purpose AI processor  for many of those major customers. But the tech companies have started  to develop their own internal chips for specific needs. Doing so helps  reduce energy consumption, and potentially can shrink the cost and time  to design.

Nvidia is now attempting to play a role in  helping these companies develop custom AI chips that have flowed to  rival firms such as Broadcom AVGO and Marvell Technology MRVL, according to the sources who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly.

""If  you're really trying to optimize on things like power, or optimize on  cost for your application, you can't afford to go drop an H100 or A100  in there,"" Greg Reichow, general partner at venture capital firm Eclipse  Ventures said in an interview. ""You want to have the exact right  mixture of compute and just the kind of compute that you need.""

Nvidia does not disclose H100 prices, which are higher than for the  prior-generation A100, but each chip can sell from $16,000 to $100,000  depending on the volume purchased and other factors. Meta has said it  plans to bring its total stock to 350,000 H100s this year.

Nvidia officials have met with representatives from Amazon .com AMZN,  Meta, Microsoft, Google and OpenAI to discuss making custom chips for  them, according to two sources familiar with the meetings. Beyond data  center chips, the company has pursued telecom, automotive and video game  customers.

In 2022, Nvidia said it would let  third-party customers integrate some of its proprietary networking  technology with their own chips. The company has said nothing about the  program since, and Reuters is reporting its wider ambitions for the  first time.

A Nvidia spokesperson declined to comment beyond the company's 2022 announcement.

Dina McKinney, a former Advanced Micro Devices AMD  and Marvell executive, heads Nvidia's custom unit and her team's goal  is to make its technology available for customers in cloud, 5G wireless,  video games and automotives, according to a LinkedIn profile. Those  mentions were scrubbed and her title was changed after Reuters sought  comment from Nvidia.

Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Meta and OpenAI declined to comment.

$30 BILLION MARKET

According  to estimates from research firm 650 Group’s Alan Weckel, the data  center custom chip market will grow to as much as $10 billion this year,  and double that in 2025.

The broader custom chip market  was worth roughly $30 billion in 2023, which amounts to roughly 5% of  annual global chip sales, according to Needham analyst Charles Shi.

Currently, custom silicon design for data centers is dominated by Broadcom and Marvell.

In  a typical arrangement, a design partner such as Nvidia would offer  intellectual property and technology, but leave the chip fabrication,  packaging and additional steps to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.  2330 or another contract chip manufacturer.

Nvidia moving into this territory has the potential to eat into Broadcom and Marvell sales.

""With  Broadcom's custom silicon business touching $10 billion, and Marvell’s  around $2 billion, this is a real threat,"" said Dylan Patel, founder of  the silicon research group SemiAnalysis. ""It's a real big negative -  there's more competition entering the fray.""

BEYOND AI

Nvidia is in talks with telecom infrastructure builder Ericsson 61QS  for a wireless chip that includes the chip designer's graphics  processing unit (GPU) technology, according to two sources familiar with  the talks.

650 Group's Weckle expects the telecom custom chip market to remain flat at roughly $4 billion to $5 billion a year.

Ericsson declined to comment.

Nvidia also plans to target the automotive and video game markets, according to sources and public social media postings.

Weckel  expects the custom auto market to grow consistently from its current $6  billion to $8 billion range at 20% a year, and the $7 billion to $8  billion video game custom chip market could increase with the  next-generation consoles from Xbox and Sony 6857.

Nintendo’s  current Switch handheld console already includes an Nvidia chip, the  Tegra X1. A new version of the Switch console expected this year is  likely to include a Nvidia custom design, according to one source.

Nintendo declined to comment.

Thing is, if something was to happen to a manufacturing plant, natural or terroristic because the supply chain and how little redundant manufacturing they have. Any hiccup would cause a catastrophic downward spiral. They don't need more cash and that's what an insurance payout would give.  They need a rock solid supply chain.

The real problem is to many institutions, 401k, and life savings are heavily propped up by nvidia. This makes it a national security threat.  A sell off of this magnitude or even correction is going to devastate our economy.

I personally believe they need to rethink and move their manufacturing to the USA. Their margins are high enough to cover the labor cost, and it is in the instrest of the USA for them to do so.

271,TSM,U.S. to reportedly announce billions of dollars in subsidies for advanced chips,"The Biden administration is expected to award billions of dollars in subsidies to top semiconductor companies, including Intel
 and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co
. (TSMC), in the coming weeks to help build new factories in the United States, The Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday.


The forthcoming announcements are aimed at kick-starting manufacturing of advanced semiconductors that power smartphones, artificial intelligence and weapons systems, the WSJ reported, citing industry executives familiar with the negotiations.


The executives expect some announcements to come before U.S. President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address on March 7, the WSJ report added.


Among the likely recipients of the subsidies, Intel has projects underway in Arizona, Ohio, New Mexico and Oregon that will cost more than $43.5 billion, the Journal said.


TSMC has two plants under construction near Phoenix for a total investment of $40 billion. South Korea’s Samsung Electronics, also a contender, has a $17.3 billion project in Texas.


Micron Technology
, Texas Instruments
 and GlobalFoundries
 count among other top contenders, WSJ said, citing industry executives.


The U.S. Department of Commerce, Intel, and TSMC did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment.


In December 2023, U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said she would make around a dozen funding awards for semiconductor chips within the next year, including multibillion-dollar announcements that could drastically reshape U.S. chip production.


The first award was announced in December, of over $35 million to a BAE Systems facility in Hampshire to produce chips for fighter planes, part of a $39 billion “Chips for America” subsidy program approved by the U.S. Congress in 2022.",530,237,1706423245.0,2024-01-28T06:27:25+00:00,t3_1acw7qp,stocks

272,TSM,Intel stock sinks as early 2024 outlook comes up short,"[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/25/intel-intc-earnings-report-q4-2023.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/25/intel-intc-earnings-report-q4-2023.html)

Intel shares dropped in extended trading on Thursday after the chipmaker issued an outlook for the first quarter of 2024 that lagged analyst forecasts even as results for the latest quarter beat Wall Street estimates.  
  
Here’s how Intel did versus LSEG (formerly Refinitiv) consensus expectations for the quarter ended in December:  
  
Earnings per share: 54 cents adjusted, vs. 45 cents expected  
Revenue: $15.4 billion vs. $15.15 billion expected

  
For the first quarter of fiscal 2024, Intel expects earnings per share of 13 cents on between $12.2 billion and $13.2 billion in sales, versus LSEG expectations of 33 cents per share on $14.15 billion of revenue.  
  
Intel posted net income of $2.7 billion, or 63 cents per share, compared to a net loss of $0.7 billion, or 16 cents per share, last year.  
  
With Intel reporting sales growth in the fourth quarter of 10% from $14.04 billion a year earlier, the company breaks a streak of seven quarters with declining revenue.  
  
Intel shares are up over 74% over the past year. The company is the largest semiconductor maker by revenue, according to Gartner, a market research firm, even though its market cap puts it below Nvidia and AMD on Wall Street.  
  
Cloud providers and large tech companies, the big spenders, have been focused on the AI boom, which explains Nvidia’s recent outperformance. In the past, the most important part in a server was the central processor made by Intel. Now, AI servers can have as many as eight Nvidia or AMD graphics processing units (GPUs) attached to one or two Intel CPUs.  
  
Intel also continues to focus on a five-year plan implemented by CEO Pat Gelsinger, who took over the chipmaker in 2021. Intel wants to catch up to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company in its ability to offer manufacturing services to other companies, while also improving its own branded chips.  
  
Intel has been cutting costs through workforce reductions and offloading small parts of its business. In the past year, the company said it would spin off its programmable chip unit, after turning self-driving car subsidiary Mobileye into an independent company in 2022.  
  
Intel’s largest division is its Client Computing group, which includes laptop and PC processor chips. The overall PC industry has been in a slump for two years, but recently started showing signs of growth again. Intel reported $8.8 billion in fourth-quarter sales, up 33%.  
  
Intel’s second largest division, Data Center and AI, saw sales decline 10% to $4 billion. That unit includes server CPUs and GPUs.  
  
Intel foundry services, its business making chips for other companies, remains nascent, with $291 million in revenue, a 63% annual increase.",455,211,1706217460.0,2024-01-25T21:17:40+00:00,t3_19fk5fp,stocks

27,TSM,💰Going Long on TSM: The Unseen Goldmine Behind NVDA’s Success💰,"Fellow apes, I want to discuss a compelling investment thesis for TSM (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company). This isn't about hype; it's about understanding the strategic position TSM holds in the semiconductor industry.

Key to this thesis is the relationship between TSM and one of its largest clients, NVDA. NVDA, a leader in the GPU market, relies almost exclusively on TSM for its chip manufacturing needs. This reliance is crucial because NVDA's business model boasts impressive gross margins, around 90%.

The crux of the investment argument for TSM lies in this dependency. TSM, as a leading foundry, has not yet fully leveraged its pricing power. Given the increasing demand for advanced chips and the limited number of players capable of manufacturing them at the cutting-edge level that companies like NVDA require, TSM is in a prime position to renegotiate pricing.

As TSM realizes its strategic advantage and adjusts its pricing model to reflect the value it provides, we can anticipate a significant impact on its revenues and margins. This scenario is not far-fetched considering the growing demand for semiconductors and the substantial investments TSM is making in advanced manufacturing technologies.

In conclusion, going long on TSM is a bet on the company's ability to capitalize on its pivotal role in the semiconductor supply chain. It's a play on the increasing value of chip manufacturing in a tech-driven world and TSM's unique position within that realm.

Yes, there is geopolitical risk but a war would also mean no chips for iPhones, NVDA and pretty much all advanced electronics. They have a plant planned in America but from whatever I can research, this is running a decade late.

i made this post in this sub a long time ago, and while my stop losses were broken (i actually didnt use those stop losses i was just trying to give a reasonable play) the stock did do what i thought it would.

TSM  went down, it made a low that was still a bit higher than its prior low, then it continued in the uptrend and made a new high. 115.

i think theres still value here. you get a pull back, especially anything south of 100 dollars, i think you could see 145 again on this stock easily over the next year if semiconductor sales stay good, which they likely will.

semiconductors are the new oil. tech is not stopping. tech runs off data and computing. data and computing are done by chips. chips need semiconductors.

diversify into ASML (i buy FEZ on RH to get diversified exposure, which is inefficient.)

buy the other foundrys INTL and SAMSUNG (I buy EWY on RH to get exposure).

find a packaging company, i buy AMKR because they do packaging and testing.

Buy other design if you want - amd, i dont. Buy NVDA if you want, i dont i own it through indexes (spy on RH spx would be better otherwise) and etfs (VOOG).

buy the coding languages ARM or some alternative.

Buy the entire supply chain.

**NVDA,** liquidity 8/10- Broke all times highs AGAIN- 575, 550, and 600 levels worth watching. This thing is a steam train and $600 is the major level that will make or break this stock (if we ever reach it). Not worth playing otherwise IMO.

**MESA**, liquidity 8/10- Enters agreement with UAL to improve operating and financing terms, very low market cap (&lt;$50M) but pretty liquid. Worth watching to see if we break $1.25 ceiling.

**AMD/TSM/Semis/etc.** – Entire sector has been hot, 

**SAVE,** liquidity 9/10- SAVE gained 25% today- it’s appealing with JBLU to appeal merger block, and reported Q4 prelim revenue.

284,TSM,Why I don't think NVDA party gonna last,"I know I know - you all think NVDA can reach higher than the sky, but here is why I say they don't. In fact, here is why I say they have already outburnt their rocket!  
Look at the list below.   
there are only 5 companies at the $1T club, and number 6 and 7 are fighting their asses off to get in. now lets talk about ALL of them, and why NVDA isn't one of them:  


1. MSFT has just this week gained supremacy and passed AAPL. There's no argue why MSFT is one of the top 5 companies in the world. They control more than 60% of all OS on all computers on the entire planet, they have access to us all with their products, and they control 22% of could services world wide with Azure. billions of users world wide uses products they 100% own, and profit of with no middleman anywhere. That's dominancy! That's not talking about LinkedIn which is considered to be the best professional social network, and they sure as fuck monetize this.
2. AAPL since they dropped Intel's processors for the M1 and later M2, they control end-to-end of their production process and have roughly 50% market share of wealthy users world wide, plus 26% of mobile users globally. Not sure if they truly invented it, but they have perfected the subscription profit model, and controlling the spending of their huge users base fiercely! And I bet there's a hidden report out there showing they control the majority of the top dome of socio-economic group. BTW a friend of mine working as senior full stack at MSFT told me they gave him a MacBook when he started working for Microsoft. He's developing MS-Office on a MacBook!!!!! 
3. Saudi-Aramco - I know shit about them, but they control oceans of oil and you know.... oil is oil
4. Google - 98% market share for online searches. plus, over 70% global market share of mobile OS and 12% share of  cloud service. All in-house and 100% owned by Google. Oh yeah, and don't forget about Youtube. Oh BTW - do you drive much? did you know that to avoid competition, Google bought Waze too?
5. AMZN - Well to be honest, I don't believe they have a strong valuable market place anymore and I am pessimistic about their retailing now days. In fact I heard somewhere (and I can't find it now) that they lost almost $10B on their forward sellings in 2022, BUT!!!! they earned over $20B off advertising on site which covers the returns and customer's care. we can argue about that, but we can't argue about the crown jewel of AMZN - AWS!!!! 33% of all data on could, is located on an AWS server. You know NFLX, DIS, and WBD streaming services? Along with Amazon prime, they are all located on the same fucking servers!!!! In fact, unless you're watching Youtube or AppleTV, if you're watching streamers, you're watching it off an AWS server! 
6. NVDA - let's roll back to it later
7. Meta - I do hate that evil empire, but there's no argue that there's no other company with as much user data as they have. Between Instagram, Facebook, whatsapp - if you want to talk or meet someone, it's probably through one of their platforms, and they monitor it.
8. Tesla - I hate Elon! I think he should be in jail for violating at least 10 SEC regulations. But he's still out there and roaming. I won't argue that TSLA is A-Z solution to car manufacturing. Everything is In-house as well, and the marketing expenses are 0!!! But in a world where everybody are looking for autonomous vehicles, Elon's got the most data collected in the world. When they talked about creating a center control for autonomous driving, they suggested Tesla will be the center since they have the biggest data centers dedicated for it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now lets get back to NVDA - 10 years ago, they were nothing. A great product for a special segment of hardcore computer users willing to spend $200-$500 on hardware no one else even knows needed.  
Back then Intel was God and AMD tried biting on them. But got no where close.   
Then AI kicked in, and engineers found out GPU are better to teach the modules rather than CPU and guess who's the best GPU manufacturer? wait no!!! It's not NVDA! They have never manufactured a single processor. They don't have a single factory. They do it all with TSMC (number 11 on the list, but around 1/3 the value on NVDA). 

Ok so they have the best design. Fuck!!! no they don't!! They use ARM technology to design their processors ($74B market cap). And why ARM are so important? well because couple months ago, NVDA wanted to buy them, so the US regulator looked this deal up, and found out these 2 companies are the only 2 companies to design such technologies and by buying them, NVDA will basically eliminate the competition, and be a full monopoly on ARM architecture processors. so how come one company is worth $74B and the other $1.4T??? because they design the best AI training processors.

WAIT!!!! FUCK they don't!!!!! haven't you heard?? AMD just steamrolled them with Frontier ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontier\_(supercomputer)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontier_(supercomputer)))  


AMD has had the best week in their life!! how good? $250B good. That's still 1/6 of NVDA.  
And wait, I mentioned Intel several times before, but what's the deal with them? Well in a nut shell, they have dragged behind. They used to have an enormous market share of processors in the market and they got cocky and neglected R&amp;D while the rest rushed to innovate. But even though you are probably reading this on an Intel based computer, or have one at work/home, and they used to be the sole suppliers for Apple computers, Intel at it's peak was worth $273B (Jan 31st 2020). Still fraction of NVDA's worth. And in opposed to NVDA, ARM and AMD - Intel has always owned their own factories, meaning their worth should combine NVDA and TSMC together!!!!

So the question remains - WTF??????

 This will be my first time actually doing a pmcc.
I have 2 stocks in mind.

TSM : chart has it ranging from $94 to $104 I seek to get a $90 call with a delta of .75 exp on 184  days then sell strike of $104 exp jan 26th . The delta is .33 premium is $132. I feel i can do this for a few weeks if not longer 

The other stock i was considering is pltr but im not sure if itll keep dropping which would kill off my long call? 

What should i know before i attemtp this trade?
Is this even a smart trade? My goal is to gain capital from theta decay.

28,TSM,Nobody asked but I averaged Altman’s Z-Score for every public company (Ex financials/SPACS/Holdcos) and the results are not great.,"Altman’s Z-score is used as a measure of how likely it is that a company will go bankrupt. A score close to 3 indicates a healthy balance sheet, and a score below 1.8 indicates distress. Altman’s Z-score cannot be used for most financial institutions/SPACS due to their vague accounting practices. 

In the data here, most Mega cap companies are relatively healthy with the exception of Intel.

274,TSM,TSMC posts flat Q4 revenue but beats expectations,"TAIPEI, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Taiwan chipmaker TSMC (2330.TW) reported a largely flat fourth-quarter revenue on Wednesday, but that still beat both the company's and market's expectations.  
The world's largest contract chipmaker, whose customers include Apple (AAPL.O) and Nvidia (NVDA.O), has benefited from a boom in artificial intelligence applications that has helped it weather the tapering off of pandemic-led demand.  
Revenue in the final three months of last year came in at T$625.5 billion ($20.10 billion), according to Reuters calculations, compared with $19.93 billion in the year-ago period.

That beat Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co's (TSMC) previous prediction for fourth-quarter revenue being in a range of between $18.8-19.6 billion, and also beat an LSEG SmartEstimate of T$617.1 billion drawn from 21 analysts.

- **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (log variance of daily gains) of the underlying asset and compare that to the current implied volatitlity (IV) of the option price. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium associated with the pricing of options (implied volatility).
    
- **Directional Bias:** Ranges from -100 (bearish) to +100 (bullish) and accounts for RSI, price trend, moving averages, and put/call skew over the past 6 weeks.

- **Priced Move:** given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move.

- **Expiration:** 2024-02-02.

- **Call/Put Premium:** How much extra you are paying for the implied move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean options are ""cheaper."" High numbers mean options are ""expensive.""

- **Efficiency:** This factor represents the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price of the option. It represents how much traders will pay in slippage with a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.

The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) seeks about 650 billion yen in a proposed supplementary budget for Japanese chipmaker Rapidus' prototype production line and an Intel research center, as well as support for advanced semiconductor designs.

About 770 billion yen in aid will be sought for a second TSMC chip plant in Kumamoto prefecture on the southernmost main island of Kyushu.

It was higher the first two hours even while the market was up on the day, an unusual occurrence, especially on a Friday. Some of that can probably be attributed to worries about the Middle East into the weekend but out-of-the-money puts are certainly being bought as hedges, with vol below the 20 delta level now above 20IV in the next two months. Keep an eye on the VIX as it's been asleep for so long it wouldn't take much for people short vol to get caught offsides. (they also could be completely correct and the market slow grinds higher into year-end, but the point is the VIX is not ""broken"" and still tells a story when it gets above 20).

The expected move for this week in SPY is a bit more than 1.5%. QQQ is about 2%. 0DTE expected moves in SPY has been pretty consistently near the 0.7% range, and QQQ 0DTE expected moves have been closing in on 1% a day. That's alot more than over the Summer when SPY 0DTE expected moves were consistently below a half a percent a day.

The one-month range in Tesla more or less lines up with the expected move for earnings this week. Here's how an Iron Condor at the expected move's breakevens line up, positioning for the chance that TSLA stays within that range following its report:

For those not in the know TSM fabs like 50% of apple chips, all NVDA chips. They are the most sophisticated chip fabrication plant on the globe. 

TSM is hanging right around the bottom of the channel of the uptrend. 

now this is a solid company, solid financials, 2% annual dividend, diversifying into arizona (with struggles) and germany (with both comes a lesser ability to produce chips than the main Taiwan factory), which removes **some** of the risk of being solely in Taiwan. Maybe a japan factory as well?

If you bought around 93-92 dollars, set a stop loss at say 87 or 86 being a significant break in trend, or maybe even as low as 84 or 83, a real break in the trend, you would lose somewhere between 6.5% to 10%. 

now if TSM continues the uptrend and we go to 100 you are up 7.5%

if we go to 105 youre up 12.9%

if TSM suprasses a high on its trip down in 2022 around 109 to hit 110, you're up 18.2%

and it just continues up from there, i mean you hit 115 and the risk reward is totally worth it. So you're a long term holder buying into the bottom of the uptrend and setting a stop loss around 88-87, 5-6% risk to make maybe 20% on the high upside, maybe 12.9-7.5 on the lowside. 

its a decent bet. 

full disclosure i think hanging around the bottom of the trend shows a little uncertainty but it also is opportunity for you. i bought days ago.

51,TSM,MGNI short put during ER - lesson learned,"Hi all, I sold 5 short puts on Magnite stock yesterday just before closing bell for each SP 12.5 and 8/18 expiration with $100 premium per contract. I was actually bullish on the stock and even if it crashes 10% thought I should be ok. Today it nose dived 35% and I BTC my 5 contracts for a total loss of $1.7K.

It took me 4 weeks to make $1.7K with various CSPs and CCs but gone with one mistake.

Lessons learned:

1. Don't sell options on any stock during ER week again (I did once back in the day with TSM CC, and then the stock took off). This time $1.7K is realized loss.
2. Don't sell options in the heat of the moment (be very careful in placing your trades with an solid exit plan).

I know many did these mistakes and burnt their hands but this is the first time I faced the harsh reality. Please read this post and don't make the same mistake. I am confident that I can cover my loss soon but the pain really stings!

66,TSM,[Week 2] AI momentum trading journey guided by chat GPT/LLM. Feedback welcome,"This is a follow-up on my latest AI trading post where I laid out my short/mid term bullish case on the AI supply chain due to major upcoming disruption driven by policy and private/public markets. Those are:

1. **The Fed’ning:** Major increase in government expenditure in relation to Global GDP that will trickle down into the AI economy.
2. **The upcoming major IOT adoption via regulatory enforcement:** FSMA food traceability act compliance deadline is fast approaching, Chipps Act, etc.
3. **Upstream/Downstream innovation in private markets:** Early stage capital has commoditized AI (APIs, et al.)  with billions of dollars of VC funding. This early stage innovation will trickle down  into public markets sooner that expected.

For those missing initial context, I’m using AI to invest in AI with automated investing strategies.

**I decided to adjust my automated investment strategy midweek (See below)**

![img](zk5vp690fkeb1 ""
 "")

1. First, I look at the momentum of SPY generally, if not I move into SVOL (VIX etf).
2. If there's positive SPY momentum, I then look at if tech is overbought or not (RSI &gt;= 80).
3. If tech is overbought, I stay in SPY.
4. If tech is not overbought, I go into my AI strategy. It's threshold rebalancing at 10%.

As I initially mentioned, I intend to be super transparent about my bet on AI and share losses as much as wins. I might change the strategy for better positioning if I think it makes sense.

277,TSM,TSMC warns of deepening chip slump as AI boom fails to offset economic woes,"The world’s biggest contract chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, has warned of a deepening semiconductor slump, as the boom in artificial intelligence fails to offset global economic woes and China’s delayed recovery.

TSMC now expects its 2023 revenue to drop by 10 per cent, rather than the less than 5 per cent it forecast three months ago, the Taiwanese company told investors on Thursday. This would translate into a 15 per cent revenue decrease in the second half of the year, compared with the same period in 2022.

“Three months ago we were probably more optimistic, but now [we are] not. The recovery of the Chinese economy is weaker than we thought, so end-market demand is not as we expected,” said CC Wei, chief executive. “Although we have very good AI end-market demand, it is not enough to offset [that weakness].”

The warning comes as the growth of large language models behind generative AI services such as ChatGPT is boosting the need for high-end processors for data centres, with TSMC making chips for Nvidia, whose AI processor business is booming.

2,TSM,"Expected moves, Tesla, Netflix, Intuitive Surgical, Capital One and more.","* Futures lower. 
* QQQ -0.70%, SPY -0.25% 
* Tesla and Netflix are both lower, but both within the expected move (thus far)

One of the things to look for as earnings season heats up is whether companies that miss see buyers below. We're about to get a test of underlying strength in the market with both Netflix and Tesla are lower on earnings. The two companies were the first mega-cap tech stocks to report this cycle. And most mega-cap stocks rallied into earnings season. If these companies miss, and find buyers below, the stocks will stay above their expected move levels, indicating an underlying bid in these stocks, folks that may have missed some of this rally, and now see a chance to get in. Obviously support levels are interesting spots to watch, but the options market provides another consistent one, the expected move. If the stocks continue lower, and close the day below their expected move (into earnings) it may indicate some buyer exhaustion, with buyers unwilling to step in or defend levels that were expected on a miss.

68,TSM,My AI momentum trading journey just started. Dumping $3k into an automated trading strategy guided by ChatGPT. Am I gonna make it,"As a major lurker, I’ve seen quite a few of these “Trading journey” posts and I decided that I might as well jump in the fire with my very own take.

The weather is just about brewing with enough chaos that we might see a decent tailwind across AI stocks within the next few months. I intend to ride the hypecycle with a an automated AI strategy to capture as much upside value as possible.

**A few things that make me believe the AI hype cycle is just getting started:**

**The Fed’ning**

* Government expenditure in relation to GDP will continue to increase This isn’t just a US phenomena, Nation states worldwide are increasing government expediture and reach.(Chipps act, various AI accessibility and regulatory acts). A good portion of this will trickle down into the market cap of bluechip co’s with big AI departments ready for big ol entreprise contracts.

**The upcoming major IOT adoption via regulatory enforcement**

* On this, I can single out an event that most people are sleeping on. The US food supply chain is about to undergo massive digital transformation with FSMA (The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act ). Think big data lakes and lots of machine learning having to be adopted at gunpoint in unseen rates all across the food supply chain.

**Upstream/Downstream innovation in private markets**

* AI tech has been commoditized, can be forked, API called, build on top of. Its pretty fluid and easy to access. As I type this, there’s tens of thousands of AI startups across all imaginable industries getting past product-market-fit hurdles, opening distribution channels, and ultimately expanding the AI global total addressable market . This early stage innovation will trickle down into public markets in record time. Wait a few months.

**My AI investment strategy - AI investing in AI (kinda “quirky” huh?)**

To create my strategy I asked an AI tool “Can you create a momentum trading strategy focused on AI-focused stocks?”  


&amp;#x200B;

The AI-created strategy was interesting but I then made some tweaks based on the basket of AI stocks I wanted to include in this momentum trading approach. I removed IBM (as I don’t think they’ll be a key beneficiary or leader in the AI race), and added PLTR (for defence/government AI exposure), TSM (for some semiconductor exposure) and META (this is a questionable one but the open source models that their research team have created our world-class and I don’t want to bet against Zuck).

You can see the final strategy below. One potential concern I have is the max drawdown from the backtests is a little higher than I’d like but I’m willing to roll with it this week. Let’s see how it does!

69,TSM,Investment plan for about 85 000$ USD over the coming year,"So I have been reading up on investing for a while now, painfully missing the amazing opportunity to buy last year. I want you to criticize, and help improve, my plan for entering my assets into stocks and ETFs over the coming year to two years.

I very strongly believe that AI will be even more transformative for society than what most expect, and will have greater implications for the overall economy than most think. I think that even buying tech related stocks, or for instance an ETF following the NASDAQ right now, near ATH, will almost definitely be a solid investment by 2030.

However I am also a bit unsure about the more short-medium term market and it would feel really bad to miss yet another great market for buying. I think I will keep a significant portion of my money outside the market for now.

I should also mention my country of residency is Norway so this has some implications for choices.

The plan:-Buy 100 shares of LYMS (**European UCITS ETF following NASDAQ** \- I think this will be better than QQQM long term due to tax benefits unique to holding European shares and funds in Norway) (Done)-Buy around 2 500 $ worth of **Norwegian dividend stocks** (Done)-Buy shares in **AMD** for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think they have a very good shot at taking AI processor market shares from Nvidia, and honestly I think I might even favor them over Nvidia in the long rund, though this is just a hunch from how good they are at developing efficient GPUs)-Buy shares in **Alphabet** ABEA for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Alphabet's DeepMind is further ahead of the curve when it comes to AI than has been fully let on by now)-Buy shares sin **Tesla Corp** TL0 for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Tesla is a solid company that will benefit both from increasing electrification of the carpool and increased potential of AI - will probably be significantly higher valued in 2030)-Buy shares in **TSMC** TSM (Only one I will not buy in the European market, but I think their incredibly dominant position in semiconductor manufacturing will make this stock really really valueable over the next 10 years unless China invades Taiwan, which I think is a bit further into the future than that, although possible)-Move the remaining 400 000 - 580 000 $ to **bank account** I just opened with the highest interest rate offered in the Norwegian market (Have cash at hand if the market should go down in the relatively near future so I can actually benefit from it next time)

Some possible additions right now:-Considering Invesco **S&amp;P 500 UCITS ETF** Acc P500 (Follows the S&amp;P 500 - with a soft landing seeming plausible and a land war raging in Europe, and Europe being further off getting its inflation under control, I think this might be a solid investment as confidence in, and the performance of, the US economy rises)-Considering Franklin FTSE **China UCITS ETF** FLXC (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, positions me to benefit if confidence in Chinese stocks rises - if the market becomes less afraid of Chinese government intervention this one will be severely undervalued. At the same time I don't want to buy specific Chinese stocks precisely because of said intervention)-Considering Franklin FTSE **India UCITS ETF** FLXI (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, the Indian economy seems to be consistently experiencing solid growth and might be a pretty good long term investment)-Considering **Apple** APC (I think the price will probably be lower at some point within the next two years, but Apple is still a really solid company that probably will be valued significantly higher than today eventually)-Considering **Microsoft** MSF, **Meta** FB2A (Big tech companies that might stand to gain from AI without being completely reliant on it either)-Considering **Amazon** (Further from full price recovery than other tech companies, stands to gain massively if US economic activity and confidence rises, though as I expect interest rates to remain high might take some time)-**Berkshire Hathaway Class B** BRYN (They seem to know what they are doing, better inherent diversification than most of the other stocks here)-Considering **Palantir** PTX (So I can sell it when Reddit speculation leads it to new heights)-Considered **Nvidia** (FOMO)-Considered **IBM** and **Intel** as competitors to Nvidia and AMD, but upon looking into it I see AMD as the only real competitor to Nvidia for now. I don't think IBM is a terrible buy, I am not convinced Intel will be more valueable long term)

So what do you think - is my plan good? Should I buy any of the stocks I am considering? Should I drop some of the stocks I am currently planning to buy? Should I keep more or less money in reserve? Am I wrong about some of the companies?

Give me your reasons and tell my why I am wrong so I can make better decisions! :)",0,13,1689600489.0,2023-07-17T13:28:09+00:00,t3_1521zl5,StockMarket

72,TSM,Gallium &amp; Germanium: How will the second half of 2023 play out? Shift in the supply chain imminent?,"How would China's recent announcement to limit gallium and germanium export affect chip-making companies? I would argue that it is possible for non-Chinese suppliers like $TECK (Canada) or $UMI (Belgium) to see an increase in production as non-Chinese chip-making companies look to source these precious metals elsewhere. $WOLF saw a 11-12% increase today in their stock price today due to the signing of a new deal for the supply of chip, they also happen to grow their own supply of silicone carbide therefore not having to rely on Chinese suppliers. Might this momentum be enough to follow through into August when Chinese restrictions come into effect?

Perhaps I'm thinking of this the completely wrong way, the latter would be the tensions between the U.S. and China crashing the tech market completely as both do not want the other's involvement in this industry. If so, could this pose a threat to $TSM? (I'm not entirely sure where they source all of their materials from though).

In summary, I would argue that companies to watch out for could be Teck Resources, Umicore and Wolfspeed. Perhaps companies like $NVDA or $QCOM might alter their chip-sourcing partners straying away from Chinese partners and look for companies in the west?

278,TSM,Intel stock drops 6% as company updates chip manufacturing plans," 

* Intel stock dropped 6% Wednesday after the company gave investors an update on the company’s turnaround plan to become a foundry competing with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.
* Intel’s new reporting structure could help control costs at the chipmaker, which is seeking to trim as much as $10 billion from its costs over the next three years.
* Other chip stocks also fell Wednesday amid a down day for tech stocks.

 Intel stock dropped 6% Wednesday after the company gave investors an update on the company’s turnaround plan to become a chip manufacturing company competing with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.

Wednesday’s update featured Intel’s Chief Financial Officer David Zinsner explaining how the company would soon change the way it reports its financial results to give its foundry business, known as IFS, its own profit-and-loss statement, which would reveal the company’s manufacturing margins.

Intel’s new reporting structure could also help control costs at the chipmaker, which is seeking to trim as much as $10 billion from its costs over the next three years.

The update comes as investors continue to assess Intel’s turnaround plan under CEO Pat Gelsinger, which depends on catching up with TSMC’s manufacturing technology by 2026, a plan it calls “five nodes in four years.” Intel plans to use its own chips to work out problems in its manufacturing before opening the factories to third-party companies.

If Intel catches up with TSMC, then it can compete for contracts to build high-performance chips from companies such as Apple, Nvidia, and Qualcomm

, which don’t run their own manufacturing and currently often opt for TSMC or Samsung manufacturing. Intel said it expected to announce a key customer for its foundry business later this year.

“The manufacturing group will now face the same market dynamics as their foundry counterparts,” Zinsner told analysts. “They’ll need to compete for volume through performance and price as internal customers will have the option to leverage third-party foundries and to attract external foundry volume, they must do the same.”

Wednesday’s update was focused on how Intel would use its manufacturing capabilities for its own chips. It said more updates on the foundry business and third-party customers would come later this year. Intel also said its own chip needs would contribute $20 billion in revenue to the unit next year.

Analysts on the call worried about Intel’s gross margins and asked how this plan would increase them. In April, Intel said its gross margin for the first quarter was 38.4%, down 51.3% in a year. Intel management said Wednesday it was shooting for 60% margins.

Separately, Intel said Wednesday that it planned to sell 20% of an Austrian subsidiary, IMS Nanofabrication, to private equity firm Bain Capital in a deal that valued the unit at $4.3 billion.

“This will turn out to be one of the best acquisitions we’ve ever made, given that level of valuation and investment made,” Zinsner said Wednesday.

Other chip stocks also fell Wednesday amid a down day for tech stocks. AMD

, Intel’s chief rival, fell nearly 6%, while Qualcomm fell more than 3%. Nvidia, which has been boosted by the recent artificial intelligence wave, fell less than 2%.",211,88,1687411253.0,2023-06-22T05:20:53+00:00,t3_14fub3p,stocks
29,TSM,What Recession? The Wall St China Trap and your money,"Let's talk about the incessant recession headlines that have been dominating the news lately. Initially centered on the United States, the focus has now shifted to a so-called ""worldwide"" recession. However, it's crucial to question the prevailing narrative and critically analyze the situation. While high interest rates in the US and globally may raise concerns, the news often presents a different story. Let's break free from the moneyed Wall Street trap and explore the reality.

Intel's Strategic Investments: A Positive Outlook

Contrary to the recession narrative, Intel is actively investing billions worldwide to address the challenges in Chinese supply chains. This shows a long-term commitment to solving the issues rather than a harbinger of economic downturn.

India's Record Order: A Sign of Economic Strength

The Paris Airshow witnessed India's historic order of 500 airplanes just this morning, hinting at a robust economic outlook. Notably, India's significance in this context cannot be overlooked, suggesting potential growth opportunities outside of China.

Challenging the Perception:My theory diverges from the prevailing belief that a recession is imminent. I argue that perceived shocks and market drops are often linked to those who deliberately choose to ignore the economic situations in Western Europe and the USA, which stand in contrast to a challenging environment in China. China's youth unemployment rate and the need for additional stimulus amid an already heated economic climate provide evidence of this. Moreover, concerns about China's real estate bubble raise more than just eyebrows for the informed investor.

Investment Strategies:Given the current market climate, it becomes crucial to identify companies that are not trading at all-time highs but possess significant growth potential. You do not want to buy VOO at ATH or the mega cap tech stocks at ATH.

One example of what is investable is TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company), which remains undervalued despite its long-term prospects. While TSMC's US factory investment is noteworthy, the key play lies in the belief that China is unlikely to invade Taiwan in the next two decades. This perspective aligns with the global will, barring any extreme actions by Xi Jinping resembling Mao's regime. If you are not aware, believe me when I say that the Xi is aware that a dozen well placed ships could block all middle eastern oil shipments from reaching China, destroying the economy, even if they could blockade Tawain. Berkshire Hathaway would potentially invest billions in TSMC if it were not entangled in Chinese interests, highlighting the company's strong position. Intel is another strong example.

While the prevailing narrative warns of a looming recession, it is essential to challenge these assumptions and examine the global economic landscape more objectively. By identifying undervalued companies with significant growth potential, such as TSMC, long-term investors can seek opportunities in the market. Depending on reception of my write up, I'll share other investment ideas if there's interest as I have identified several.

TL:DR Wall Street has way too much money in China, they need to offload it to under-informed investors in an enviroment like this.

* **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (log variance of daily gains) of the underlying asset and compare that to the current implied volatitlity (IV) of the option price. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium associated with the pricing of options (implied volatility).
* **Directional Bias:** Ranges from -100 (bearish) to +100 (bullish) and accounts for RSI, price trend, moving averages, and put/call skew over the past 6 weeks.
* **Priced Move:** given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move.
* **Expiration:** 2023-06-16.
* **Call/Put Premium:** How much extra you are paying for the implied move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean options are ""cheaper."" High numbers mean options are ""expensive.""
* **Efficiency:** This factor represents the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price of the option. It represents how much traders will pay in slippage with a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.
* **E.R.:** Days unitl the next Earnings Release. This feature is still in beta as we work on a more complete list of earnings dates.
* **Why isn't my stock on this list?** It doesn't have ""weeklies"", the underlying is ""too cheap"", or the options markets are too illiquid (open interest) to qualify for this strategy. 480 underlyings are used in this report and only the top results end up passing the criteria for each filter.",14,1,1686945642.0,2023-06-16T20:00:42+00:00,t3_14b6gzw,options

My US portfolio is mostly Microsoft, Apple, AMD, Amazon and I'm betting heavily on big growth in tech sector due to AI development.

74,TSM,3 soaring stocks that show no signs of slowing down,"\-Nvidia has bounced back this year from its dismal 2022, and enthusiasm for AI can continue to drive shares higher.  
\-Taiwan Semiconductor is poised to benefit from a multi-decade growth runway for chips.  
\-General Electric's incredible run isn't over yet.

**These chip and industrial stocks have tons of upside potential.**  
No matter how long you've been investing, you've probably heard the phrase ""buy low, sell high."" But it's not that easy. In fact, following this advice can frequently result in money being left on the table. Outsized gains are typically realised over a multi-year period by allowing winning positions to compound. The best companies have a habit of improving their fundamentals until they reach a premium valuation. This has been the case with a company like Apple, which has effectively compounded its earnings (and bought back its stock) to justify a sustained valuation expansion. Nvidia ($NVDA), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ($TSM), and General Electric ($GE) are three well-known stocks that are currently on fire but may still be worth investing in.

**Nvidia is a smart way to invest in AI**  
Scott Levine (Nvidia): Falling more than 50% in 2022, Nvidia's stock has roared back in 2023. Since the start of the year, shares of Nvidia have skyrocketed about 160%. While the stock had climbed steadily through the first four months of the year, most recently the catalyst behind the stock's rise was a strong first-quarter 2024 earnings report and guidance for Q2 2024. And, despite the stock's meteoric climb this year, there's still reason to believe shares can fly even higher.  
  
In all likelihood, most investors recognize Nvidia for its prowess in graphics processing units (GPUs). What many may not know, however, is that the company is also at the forefront of artificial intelligence (AI) -- an area that has exploded in popularity recently thanks to ChatGPT. While Nvidia played a pivotal role in the development of ChatGPT, the company's AI offerings transcend this one AI chatbot.

Thanks to its industry-leading GPUs -- critical components in training AI -- Nvidia is highly sought after by companies developing AI systems. In late March, for example, Nvidia announced that Alphabet's Google Cloud will be the first cloud services provider to use its L4 GPU for assisting in the development of large generative AI models. A variety of other industry leaders also rely on Nvidia for their AI platforms, including AT&amp;T, Oracle, and Adobe.  
  
With Nvidia's recent rise, the stock is trading at a premium. Currently, shares are valued at 68 times forward earnings. With this steep price tag, it wouldn't be surprising if investors choose to take profits, resulting in a slight decline. Over the long term, though, with some analysts forecasting the generative AI market to rise from $11.3 billion to $51.8 billion in 2028, Nvidia is well positioned to see its stock outperform the market -- especially since the company relies on much more than simply its AI solutions to keep the lights on.

**Taiwan Semi has it all**  
Daniel Foelber (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing): Shares of Taiwan Semi have rebounded nicely after a brutal 2022. And for good reason. The stock had sold off primarily due to concerns about a slowing economy (which impacts cyclical chip stocks) and Taiwan Semi's geopolitical risk with China. The industry leader now sells for an inexpensive valuation -- sporting a price-to-earnings ratio of 14 (near a 10-year low).  
  
Shares of Taiwan Semi got an additional boost after Nvidia blew expectations out of the water and soared to a new all-time high. While Taiwan Semi doesn't have the direct exposure to AI that a chip company like Nvidia does, it does provide a catch-all way to benefit from a rising tide in AI and robotics.

Taiwan Semi operates a third-party foundry business that receives designs from customers like Apple, Nvidia, and Advanced Micro Devices (among others) and manufactures chips to their specifications. In this vein, Taiwan Semi is one of the more straightforward ways to indirectly benefit from a growing chip industry. Instead of building a new factory and hoping customers come knocking on the door, Taiwan Semi's expansions are more so in response to its customers demanding higher volumes and increasingly sophisticated products.  
  
There's a short list of third-party foundries that can handle a surge in chip manufacturing as a result of AI and other trends -- giving Taiwan Semi a wide moat in addition to massive growth potential. The biggest risk for this company is geopolitical. However, it is combating that risk by expanding outside of Taiwan with a new 4-nanometer fab in Arizona and a sophisticated technology fab in Japan (both are expected to come online in late 2024).   
  
With an inexpensive valuation, industry leadership, growth opportunities, cheap-looking shares, and a 1.9% dividend yield to boot, there's a lot to like about Taiwan Semi stock -- even though it's run up a lot in the last month.

**GE's end markets keep improving**  
Lee Samaha (General Electric): The industrial powerhouse General Electric is up over 55% in 2023 but still has room to run. The reasoning behind this argument is that all three of its end markets continue to improve.   
GE is a much smaller company now than in Jack Welch and Jeff Immelt's heydays. Following the healthcare spinoff early this year, GE is now focused on aerospace (mainly commercial with some defense exposure), power (especially gas turbines and services), and renewable energy (wind power and grid solutions).   
In aerospace, GE continues to enjoy the benefits of the recovery in commercial aerospace and a gradually improving supply chain. GE Aerospace grew orders by 14% in the first quarter, and its joint venture with Safran, CFM International, is on track to ramp up production of its LEAP engines by 50% in 2023. While the LEAP comes with a negative engine margin, it generates highly lucrative aftermarket revenue spread over decades as the engines are used.   
In addition, GE Aerospace may have an opportunity to take market share on the Airbus A320 neo family of aircraft. Its competitor on the airplane, Raytheon Technologies' geared turbofan engine (GTF), has disappointed some airlines with durability issues in harsh environments.   
GE Power is heading for another solid year, with management forecasting low-single-digit revenue growth and ""slightly better"" operating profit than in 2022. However, given that the natural gas price has fallen by 74% over the last year and 33% this year, it's likely that gas turbine usage will increase, leading to more services revenue and a possible increase in investment in gas turbines.   
Finally, the infrastructure bill is unleashing pent-up demand in GE's core market, U.S. onshore. As such, GE Renewable Energy orders rose 94% in the first quarter to $5.4 billion, driven by onshore wind and two large grid solutions orders to connect renewable energy sources to the grid.   
Given the strengthening momentum in its end markets, there's plenty of reason to believe the industrial company could exceed its earnings guidance.",0,14,1685440419.0,2023-05-30T09:53:39+00:00,t3_13vlwwm,stocks
75,TSM,"Not all ""tech"" companies deserve to have tech valuations","I often hear a lot about how this &amp; that company are the next Amazon so the PE ratio does not apply to them.

There's a simple question that can tell you whether a company can have tech PEs: do they have unique products that enable them to grow their profit exponentially while keeping their costs linear? If the answer is no, they are just waiting for a correction. Even Amazon's valuation is mostly due to AWS &amp; not their retail side. 

For example:

Uber should not have a tech valuation: they are a modern cab company that needs to hire drivers and deal with local presence &amp; its costs grow at the same rate as its revenue. That's why they are not profitable &amp; likely never will be.

TSLA is another one, we can all see now that they want to scale, their margins are shrinking &amp; getting closer to all other car manufacturers.

NVDA is even more prevalent: datacentres don't need an infinite number of GPUs to use pre-trained models to run generative AI applications. They currently have a demand surge &amp; after one or two quarters, the demand will go down just like the crypto craze. The $1 trillion projection Jensen did was pure nonsense. No semi company should have software tech PEs as they cannot grow exponentially while keeping their costs linear. Especially a company like NVDA which is at the mercy of TSM, ASML &amp; others to produce anything.


Edit: No, I don't have exposure to NVDA but the subreddit is full of FOMO posts in last 3 days.

Edit 2: Not financial advice or anything close to it. Just random thoughts.",87,95,1685231819.0,2023-05-27T23:56:59+00:00,t3_13tm27w,stocks
76,TSM,Taiwan Semiconductor is a screaming buy,"Taiwan Semiconductor is trading at a P/E ratio of 15. ASML, a similarly important semiconductor company who is also the global leader in its respective field commands a P/E of 37. Nvidia, and AMD also trade at far higher multiples despite being largely dependent on TSM for chips.

The reason TSM is so cheap compared to these other companies is because of the geopolitical risks associated with investing in a Taiwanese company. However, this risk is way overstated on many levels.

#1. China invading Taiwan is nowhere near a certainty.
#2. TSM is building manufacturing plants outside of Taiwan including in Arizona.
#3. Most importantly if China were to invade Taiwan, the entire stock market would drop off a cliff. US involvement and concerns over nuclear war would hit all non military stocks.


In that situation TSM probably falls like 70% but the rest of the market may drop by 30%. Buying a company trading at half its market value is entirely worth it if the biggest risk is that it would lose an extra 40% in value in the event of WW3 starting. 

I don’t know about y’all, but I’d be more worried about getting drafted then I would about my portfolio underperforming the market.

Investing in TSM is like getting 2/1 odds that WW3 won’t happen in the next 10 years.

30,TSM,Third time is a charm? Nearing the End - long post," I haven't posted here in awhile mostly because I havent had much to say. But I think the next couple of weeks will be interesting. I hate people who waffle so here's what I am saying in case you don't want to read the long post: the VIX is going higher and the market is going lower and there is already evidence the house of cards is teetering.

I am not going to discuss the terrible breadth in the market, or what the VIX is actually signaling the market will do in the next couple of months (move in a 1% range), or the fact that we are being invaded at our southern border, or that the market returns are largely due to five stocks, or that CMG has a PE of 55, Salesforce 961 PE, Zoom 187, NVDA 162, or that earnings were terrible if you remove cost cutting measures etc. None of that matters either apparently.

# When will this tight range end?

Way back in February, I posted somewhat jokingly that what would drive everyone nuts is if the SP500 pinned itself to the 4000 level. Here we are in June and thats effectively what its done. I've posted about my frustration, my bewilderment and then my conviction that when it does break, it will be to the downside.

Whats important is not to take one or two data points and then deduct a result that is full of confirmation bias. However, I believe we are close - like next two weeks close - to this market being able to break out of this range.

A couple of points (thanks again to my expat genius on Twitter @/frankoz95967943 who learned me the very complex details of this) - all of these I have discussed at length in posts on my sub):

1. VIX is being suppressed artificially. I have covered how in previous posts. Simplest way to know is to look at HYG. It normally correlates. Not anymore.
2. Oil is also being suppressed. Again, if oil rises, everything else rises in price. The Fed does not want inflation. Best way to fight inflation is to keep oil down. I've shared how they are doing this in previous posts. (links at the end)
3. The Japanese are the major fbuddy helping the Fed do all of this.

I have to tell you that in +30 years in the market managing assets, I have not seen a market like this before. It is unnatural and controlled. That's why the VIX keeps dropping when risk keeps rising. I have posted at great length about the outlier risks that currently exist (Ukraine, banks, etc.) so no need to get into that again.

# WHY IS IT DIFFERENT NOW?

So a couple of things have happened and a couple are scheduled to happen that have caused me to go out on a limb and say this: what the Fed can control is limited and the end is near. Yes, the Fed can print money ad infinitum, like they have been doing, and the Japanese can play their role, but at some point, outside events will occur that they cannot control. Even with the help of the devil, I mean Jamie Dimon and JPM.

Here is what has happened recently:

# TRIGGER #1: OIL being manipulated is close to being out of US hands:

1. As I postulated earlier, because the US keeps hammering down the price of oil, eventually those countries whose GDP is based on oil might decide they've had enough. Well, OPEC+ is communicating they've had enough.
   1. [Saudi Minister Says OPEC+ Could Cut Production At Any Time | OilPrice.com](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Saudi-Minister-Says-OPEC-Could-Cut-Production-At-Any-Time.html)
2. Then there is this: [Iraq And Iran Ignore U.S. Sanctions In Talks To Expand Energy Ties | OilPrice.com](https://oilprice.com/Geopolitics/Middle-East/Iraq-And-Iran-Ignore-US-Sanctions-In-Talks-To-Expand-Energy-Ties.html)
3. There this: [Syria’s normalization signals a new Middle Eastern order (brookings.edu)](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2023/05/10/syrias-normalization-signals-a-new-middle-eastern-order/) &lt;----- Let's not forget that Assad is a war criminal. So bad that the Arab league suspended Syria's membership in 2011.
   1. Of course, the NeoCons in the US govt respond by doing this: [US lawmakers introduce bill to combat normalization with Syria's Assad (yahoo.com)](https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/us-lawmakers-introduce-bill-combat-135934548.html)

The Middle East seems to be getting MORE peaceful, not less, Israel excluded of course. Why? I think its because they see that they have a shot at gaining more control over their regional politics AND perhaps a chance to wean themselves off of the US dollar dependance.

If the price of oil is allowed to trade freely, its going up. Period. If the price of oil goes up, inflation goes up.

# RESULT: If oil goes up, inflation goes up, and then the Fed will truly lose control.

# TRIGGER #2: DEBT CEILING TALKS

Lots of news lately about the debt ceiling. Of course the debt ceiling would not be a problem if the US just spent LESS but thats a moot point since thats not going to happen. I don't know if the US will default, probably not a full default anyway. BUT, the mere appearance of the possibility of the US defaulting will cause risk assets to plummet.

1. [Biden and Hill leaders postpone debt meeting as deal talks continue - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/05/11/debt-limit-meeting-between-biden-and-hill-leaders-postponed-00096548)
2. [McCarthy was 'disrespectful' in Biden meeting on debt limit, sources say (nbcnews.com)](https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/mccarthy-was-disrespectful-in-biden-meeting-on-debt-limit-sources-say-173870149509) \- what a bunch of children.
3. [McCarthy blasts Biden after White House debt ceiling meeting (axios.com)](https://www.axios.com/2023/05/09/mccarthy-biden-white-house-debt-ceiling-meeting)

Look, they will raise the debt ceiling at some point. The question is how long it will take and who will blink first. However, the longer it takes, the more nervous the markets become.

Don't forget this too: ***The Treasury General Account fell to $154 billion, down from $184 billion on May 9th. In fact, at this rate, the account will be EMPTY on May 19th. OPEX.***

Don't be fooled by the chatter of deals and more deals. Yes, a deal will get done but the point is the SP500 is not trading like there is any concern.

# RESULT: The empty TGA will force the US government to RAISE rates it offers to investors to fund operations. Raising rates is bad for the market.

# TRIGGER #3: SHORT SELLING BAN on bank stocks.

Beyond the hypocrisy of this, compounded by the fact that other than Yellen, the main spokesperson trumpeting this idea is the devil, I mean Jamie Dimon, is the fact that the last time they did this in 2008 after Lehman, 3 months later the XLF was down 51%.

1. [JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon wants US regulators to consider a ban on the short selling of bank stocks | Business Insider India](https://www.businessinsider.in/stock-market/news/jpmorgan-ceo-jamie-dimon-wants-us-regulators-to-consider-a-ban-on-the-short-selling-of-bank-stocks/articleshow/100169845.cms)
2. [Calls to Investigate Short Sellers Intensify as Bank Crisis Deepens - The New York Times (nytimes.com)](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/12/business/dealbook/jamie-dimon-short-sellers-banks.html) &lt;---short sellers as being blamed for bank failures - thats rich.
3. Oddly the SEC says nope.
4. TREASURY SECRETARY YELLEN TO MEET TOP BANK CEOS NEXT WEEK IN WASHINGTON: POLITICO &lt;---- prob to discuss the $18b they are going to force on the banks to recapitalize the bank insurance fund.
5. Discussions of raising the FDIC limit to infinity &lt;--- this is bank nationalization or rather, JPM et al.

# RESULT: A BAN WILL ONLY OCCUR IF ANOTHER BANK IS ABOUT TO FAIL - this is the only reason. IF IT OCCURS, BYE BYE MARKET.

# TRIGGER #4: MONEY IS LEAVING AAPL.

AAPL is close to an all time high. As AAPL goes so goes the market. AAPL's earnings S U C K E D unless you are a fan of gains due to outsourcing of labor overseas. Also, Foxconn, AAPL's largest supplier, reported a 56% drop in net income ( [Apple supplier Foxconn's Q1 profit plunges, outlook ""conservative"" | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-supplier-foxconns-q1-profit-falls-56-yy-worse-than-forecasts-2023-05-11/) ). Oh and Samsung Electronics profit fell 95% in first quarter. But yeah, AAPL is fine.

But while the stock is going up, money is leaving:

1. 2 billion left the stock May 5
   1. Money flowed in May 10th
2. Then this past Friday, 7 billion - and no its not repositioning or some other reason.

***Since Jan 1, AAPL has added $760,000,000,000 in market cap. Sure, that makes sense.***

# RESULT: AAPL rolling over will pull the techs and the rest of the market down.

# All it will take is FOR ONE OF THE ABOVE THINGS TO HAPPEN and the market goes down.

# But wait, thats not all. Here are some possible ""canaries in the coal mine"":

# The VVIX, which is the volatility of the VIX, is going UP when the VIX is being manipulated going down. HUH?

1. The UAE announced a $10 billion short position on US stocks last week. What's odd is how public this announcement was.
   1. I believe this was another warning to Washington to knock off their manipulation of the oil markets.
   2. Our government responded 2 days later that they would start buying to refill the markets in June. What?? Why would you communicate when you will buy in the open markets? The US has publicly stated they will only buy when oil is $67-$72 per barrel. Either the US thinks thats where oil will be or they are communicating to OPEC+ (the + is for Russia) that they will be done screwing around in June.

# OTHER RISK BEING IGNORED:

1. US Banks - not any better regardless of what Yellen and JP and the devil say. There is a structural problem with regional banks: they cannot compete unless they take on more risk and that has led to them taking on more risk which is why the banking system is set to collapse - collapse into a national banking system, run by the devil of course. I am not a conspiracy theorist - if you understand how much money the TBTF banks are getting for less than 1% from the Fed, you understand that regionals dont have a chance.
2. Ukraine - there is still a war going on. People are dying. The US public is done caring about Ukraine having moved on to better things.
3. China / Taiwan - probably not this summer since Taiwan is going to be having an election in 2024 and if the KMT party wins, unification, i mean war is called off: China wins, without a single shot being fired. By the way, this is the great idea our leaders Washington have if China invades: [US Threatens To 'Blow Up' Taiwan's Semiconductor Manufacturing Firm If China Invades The Island; Taipei Unhappy (eurasiantimes.com)](https://eurasiantimes.com/us-threatens-to-blow-up-taiwans-semiconductor-manufacturing/) WHEN YOU HAVE FRIENDS LIKE US...

   4. Trucking rates are WORSE than the 2019 ""Trucking Bloodbath"" when 10 large trucking companies went bk. Truck rates are down to $1.19/mile with operating costs up $.30 mile since then. This doesnt even include rising finance costs. (thanks to Craig Fuller@freightalley on Twitter).
5. Other items of interest are credit card chargeoffs higher than 2008 levels, rising auto loan delinquencies, poor tax collections, layoffs, BBBY bankruptcy (this would've normally crashed the market for a day or so due to their large real estate holdings). But yeah, there's no inflation.

# And really, the big data point to me that proves without a doubt the VIX is being manipulated is the following chart which shows that normally, like the last 15 years, when yields move higher, the VIX moves higher (historical R [correlation] of 71.21%). But not this time I guess. VIX is purple, Yields are green.

# CONCLUSION:All it will take is for one card to fall in this humongous house of cards. And I only listed a couple of them.

The US stock market is apparently not concerned. Since the VIX is sub 17 and headed to 0.

The FED is controlling what it can. They are running out of time and money.

The next two weeks are crucial and I have little confidence in Washington &lt;--- they will screw up enough where they can't hide it.

* OPEX this Friday
* TGA runs out of money - probably this Friday
* Debt ceiling talks get ulgier - already happening.

1. ***Celebration over universal*** *~~healthcare~~* ***FDIC insurance.***
2. ***AAPL sets a new ATH***
3. ***VIX collapses below 14***

31,TSM,"China, Taiwan, Semiconductors, and Intel","Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor; I barely know how to read.

Russia updated the existing playbook re: how to invade a neighboring country without getting the US involved. At this point, it doesn't seem to be ""whether"" China will invade Taiwan, it's more like ""when"". And apparently Taiwan and semiconductors have some sort of relationship.

So I asked ChatGPT, ""Who has technology, know-how, resources, etc. to actually try to cover a potential loss of semiconductors or increase in prices?""

*Semiconductor manufacturing is a highly specialized and capital-intensive industry, and it cannot be quickly or easily ramped up in response to sudden geopolitical changes. The technology, knowledge, and infrastructure required to build advanced semiconductor manufacturing facilities (also known as fabs) can take years, if not decades, to develop and billions of dollars in investment.*

*If China were to invade Taiwan, potentially disrupting the operations of major Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturers like TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company), it would have a significant impact on the global semiconductor supply chain, including the U.S. market. As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, the following entities might potentially step in to mitigate such a disruption:*

1. *Intel Corporation (USA): Intel has been investing heavily in its manufacturing capabilities and announced in 2021 that it plans to become a major provider of foundry services in the U.S. and Europe. However, as of 2021, Intel's foundry capabilities are not yet on par with TSMC's in terms of the most advanced processes.*
2. *Samsung Electronics (South Korea): Samsung has extensive semiconductor manufacturing capabilities and could potentially increase its production to cover some of the demand, but this would require significant investment and time.*
3. *Other global semiconductor manufacturers: Other companies, such as Micron Technology, Texas Instruments, or Infineon, could potentially increase their production or expand into new areas, but they would face similar challenges as Intel and Samsung.*
4. *US Government initiatives: The U.S. government has been taking steps to bolster domestic semiconductor manufacturing to reduce reliance on foreign suppliers. This includes proposed funding and incentives for semiconductor research, design, and manufacturing through legislation like the CHIPS for America Act.*
5. *Global cooperation: Other countries and regions, including Europe and Japan, are also interested in expanding their semiconductor manufacturing capabilities. Global cooperation could help mitigate the impact of a potential disruption in Taiwan.*

*However, it's important to note that any mitigation efforts would face significant challenges and would likely take several years to have a substantial impact. The most advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes, such as those used by TSMC to produce 5nm and 3nm chips, are incredibly complex and difficult to replicate. Additionally, expanding semiconductor manufacturing capabilities would require significant investment, a highly skilled workforce, and an extensive supplier network. As such, it's unlikely that any entity could fully cover a significant disruption in Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturing in the short term.*

Then I looked at Intel's stock, sitting at like \~$30, less than half of what it was two years ago with basically the same balance sheet, and started wondering, am I missing something here? How can the market be so fickle with this company that actually \*makes\* physical/real stuff? Is Intel not a decent-looking buy/hold given their $20b investment in a New Albany manufacturing facility and other non-Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturing locations (e.g. Ireland)?  Would it be an easy buy ""if"" China invades Taiwan? Even if not, isn't every day China doesn't invade Taiwan an extra day Intel gets to play catch up? Is the time-horizon on this too long to be interesting? Is Apple going to step in and prevent this war?",19,38,1683670002.0,2023-05-09T22:06:42+00:00,t3_13d7orp,wallstreetbets

78,TSM,The Semiconductor/Chip Bubble," Hi everyone,

I want to start by clarifying that this is ***not*** financial advice.

I believe that there is a semiconductor bubble that is anywhere between 2 to 3 quarters from popping.

A combination of growing recession, war, supply chain, and decreasing demand pressures exasperated by overvaluation in the chip space is a ticking time bomb.

# Let's start by reviewing the decreasing demand for semiconductors...

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;WASHINGTON—April 6, 2023—The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) today announced global semiconductor industry sales totaled $39.7 billion during the month of February 2023, a decrease of 4.0% compared to the January 2023 total of $41.3 billion and 20.7% less than the February 2022 total of $50.0 billion. Monthly sales are compiled by the [World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS) organization](https://www.wsts.org/) and represent a three-month moving average. SIA represents 99% of the U.S. semiconductor industry by revenue and nearly two-thirds of non-U.S. chip firms.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Regionally, year-to-year sales increased slightly in February in Japan (1.2%), but decreased in Europe (-0.9%), the Americas (-14.8%), Asia Pacific/All Other (-22.1%), and China (-34.2%). Month-to-month sales were down across all regions: Europe (-0.3%), Japan (-0.3%), Asia Pacific/All Other (-3.6%), the Americas (-5.3%), and China (-5.9%).

**Souce:** [https://www.semiconductors.org/global-semiconductor-sales-decrease-4-month-to-month-in-february/](https://www.semiconductors.org/global-semiconductor-sales-decrease-4-month-to-month-in-february/)

The bottleneck for semiconductors seems to have certainly passed, and I would expect to see the balance sheet for semiconductor and chip manufacturers to begin contracting.

# Moving onto war and legislative pressures, I believe that this industry has tremendous exposure to China &amp; Taiwan...

TSMC is the largest producer of semiconductors, virtually all other chip manufacturers rely on TSMC to produce their semiconductors. Additionally, outside of TSMC, many chip manufacturers rely on China for at least part of their chip manufacturing or assembly as well.

I believe that the growing conflict between China and Taiwan may be approaching a tipping point.

Although tensions have been high between Taiwan and China for sometime, a recent Quiver Quant Instagram reel outlines some suspicious trading behavior from Senator Tommy Tuberville as well as Warren Buffet regarding TSMC.

Reel: [https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cq89p-1ggyM/?utm\_source=ig\_web\_copy\_link](https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cq89p-1ggyM/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)

Yahoo Finance Article on Buffet TSM Sale: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-says-unusually-quick-002444050.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-says-unusually-quick-002444050.html)

Quiver Quant Page on TSM Trades: [https://www.quiverquant.com/dashboard/TSM/](https://www.quiverquant.com/dashboard/TSM/)

I believe that this conflict will create a huge supply chain issues for chip manufacturers. I believe it will be a delayed issue, meaning that we won't see the issue manifest for at least a quarter or two on earnings, and I would not be surprised if their first earnings following the conflict is actually stronger, but their forward guidance becomes incredibly poor.

Adding to the bottleneck they may be experiencing with semiconductors, I believe that OPECs decision to reduce oil production will also manifest itself as additional operating costs for the chip manufacturers. The cost to import parts will increase and henceforth their operating cost as well.

Here in the U.S, I believe this will be a stark contrast for us month to month. The government has been able to artificially suppress crude oil prices by dipping into the the national reserve, however, this is not sustainable long term. Once this stops, we'll see a big jump from moderate to high inflation in a matter of days and this will likely shock our economy quite a bit.

# Overvaluation...

I'm specifically taking aim at NVDA. They have a book value of approximately $8.96 but closed the trading day on 4/14/23 at $267.58

That is 29.86x their book value. YTD their stock price has risen 80.18% while their actual book value has dropped from $10.62 to $8.96 YOY from Q4 of 2021 to Q4 of 2022.

To contrast, TSM's price-to-book ratio is 4.72 as of 4/14/23.

AMD's P2B value is 2.70, and just for fun, TSLA's is 13.09

Obviously when we look at the actual price of a stock, we understand that a large degree of a stock's price is speculation. I'm arguing that the speculation in NVDA's stock price is out of control, and that at some point it will return to a more reasonable price-to-book ratio.

I believe in this case, the conflict between Taiwan and China will be the catalyst that will accelerate NVDA's waterfall down into a more reasonable price point.

I do believe that after this bubble bursts, we're going to form another bubble, so I'll be looking to reverse my positions at some point.

Specifically I will be looking at INTC and MSFT to lead the next bubble in this sector given their foray into semiconductor manufacturing.",2,57,1682882528.0,2023-04-30T19:22:08+00:00,t3_1340jmy,stocks

I scrapped articles analysing the last earnings report, and **asked ChatGPT to summarise key new information and how market reacted to the new release.**

Here are the results for this week biggest earnings.

&amp;#x200B;

# LMT: Lockheed Martin Corp 

Lockheed Martin's Q1 results exceeded analysts' expectations, leading to a record high stock surge. Revenue rose by less than 1% to over $15 billion, but the company expects revenue to decline this year due to supply chain constraints. Lockheed saw a decline of 2% in its aeronautics revenue, primarily due to a backlog of F-35 fighter jets. However, the company gained a boost in contracts related to the war in Ukraine, expected to generate $1.5 billion in sales this year and up to $6 billion by 2027. The Chinese government has banned senior executives from Lockheed and Raytheon from entering, working, or residing in China, along with imports and exports related to China.

Lockheed Martin's stock rose by almost 2.5% on the day, and it is up by more than 3% year-to-date, showing that Wall Street is taking notice of the company. Investors are concerned about the China issue and the potential for decoupling from Chinese suppliers, leading to dependency on other sources. The next presidential election may focus on this issue, as both sides of the political spectrum agree that the US needs to decrease its dependence on China. Many industries, including technology, chips, and production, are dependent on China, and this issue is likely to resurface repeatedly in the near future.

&amp;#x200B;

# GS: Goldman Sachs Group Inc 

Goldman Sachs (GS) reported a drop in quarterly profit year-over-year, leading to a 2% decrease in share price on April 18, 2023. While they beat earnings expectations, the company missed on top-line revenue. Despite this, the drop was not significant compared to previous months in bank stocks. In the earnings call, CEO David Solomon discussed the new deposit channel provided by the bank's recent partnership with Apple to offer savings accounts to holders of the Apple Card. The move into the deposit space is seen as an attempt to keep up with the trend of online high-yield savings accounts offering upward of 4%.

The bank saw a drop of 17% to $3.93 billion in fixed income trading revenue and posted a loss of $470 million on the partial sale of its $4 billion Marcus loans portfolio. Retail banking, which has a smaller role in Goldman, saw deposits down by about 3.1% quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. The bank's CEO, David Solomon, said that the events of the first quarter demonstrated the resilience of Goldman Sachs and the largest financial institutions in the country. 

&amp;#x200B;

# NFLX: Netflix Inc 

Netflix Inc. (NFLX) reported its Q1 2023 earnings with mixed results, posting 1.75 million new subscribers, well below the expected 2.3 million. The company also announced an updated timeline for its password sharing crackdown, with the United States expected to receive the update in Q2. Despite the missed subscriber numbers and the stock decline, Netflix still added at least 1 million new subscribers in the Asia-Pacific region for the past five quarters. The company also said farewell to its mail-order DVD business that has been operating for 25 years.

The market reaction to the earnings release was negative, and the company's shares fell nearly 3% on Wednesday. The weaker-than-expected subscriber growth and the delay in the password-sharing crackdown contributed to the decline in stock price. Investors are skeptical about the possible benefits of password sharing crackdown and are waiting to see how the restriction will play out. They also want to see more traction and more established markets, where monetisation initiatives like advertising can drive growth. Analysts believe that it's still very early innings in building out the ad tech stack and that the paid-sharing product cycle is more skewed towards Q3 or Q4.

&amp;#x200B;

# TSLA: Tesla Inc 

Tesla (TSLA) reported weaker-than-expected Q1 earnings, which weighed on other electric vehicle (EV) stocks, including GM and Rivian. The company had previously cut prices at the beginning of the year, which led to a shrinking profitability in Q1. However, Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, said the company will likely launch full self-drive technology this year and generate significant profits, which could offset some of the margin pressure it’s facing due to aggressive price cuts. Despite the weaker Q1 earnings, Tesla’s EVs are still completely sold out at the moment, which has helped alleviate some of the pricing pressures felt by Ford since rival Tesla started cutting prices this year. 

&amp;#x200B;

# T: AT&amp;T Inc 

AT&amp;T Inc reported a slowdown in growth in postpaid phone subscribers for Q1 2023, but the number still beat estimates. Free cash flow fell short of expectations but was reaffirmed by the company's CFO. The business is still growing, and the overall industry is also seeing growth. AT&amp;T's wireless service revenue growth for the quarter is over 5%, and the business grew profits by 8%.

The market reacted negatively to the news, and AT&amp;T shares fell after the earnings release. Although the growth in subscribers still beat estimates, the slowdown is a cause for concern. Free cash flow also fell short of expectations, but the company's CFO reaffirmed the outlook for free cash flow, stating that it would progressively get better as the year went on. The health of the consumer is relatively stable, and the delinquency patterns remain consistent with those seen in the second half of 2022. The business is relatively resilient, but the lower-income cohorts are more challenged.

&amp;#x200B;

# PM: Philip Morris International Inc 

Philip Morris International Inc reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.38, exceeding analysts' consensus of $1.34 per share for the first quarter of 2023. However, the company's revenues fell short of expectations. While Philip Morris is facing ongoing headwinds, its long-term smoke-free goals remain on track. Favorable pricing variance has been an upside for the company, although earnings declined year over year..

The markets reacted negatively to the news, with Philip Morris International falling in Thursday trading. The decline followed the announcement that the company's revenue missed expectations. 

&amp;#x200B;

# TSM: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd 

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC), the world’s largest contract chipmaker and a major Apple supplier, announced a revenue slowdown in Q2 due to the weak global economy and high energy prices weighing on demand. The company’s CFO, Wendell Huang, stated that TSMC is expecting further inventory adjustments to continue impacting its business in Q2 2023, and the company forecasts a Q2 revenue of between $15.2 billion and $16 billion, down from $18.16 billion a year earlier. The chipmaker’s Q1 earnings rose and beat expectations, but it was the smallest quarterly earnings growth in almost four years. Despite the revenue forecast, TSMC reaffirmed its target for capital spending this year, and its shares rose about 4% after earlier being down.

TSMC’s Q2 revenue forecast highlights the inventory glut consumers are facing, while a weakening global economy clouds the demand outlook. However, the fact that TSMC reaffirmed its target for capital spending this year despite the revenue forecast provides some optimism. TSMC is an important supplier to Apple and a bellwether for the rest of the chip industry. Despite the worse-than-expected Q2 revenue forecast, the company’s shares rose around 4%, indicating that investors have already factored in the expected slowdown.",20,12,1682021345.0,2023-04-20T20:09:05+00:00,t3_12tdkcd,wallstreetbets

53,TSM,"Expected Moves: Low IV Trading and Earnings from Netflix, Tesla, Goldman, IBM and more.","## Market View

**Last Week – Closing with a VIX Level we haven’t seen in years**

SPY finished higher by about 0.8% last week, another fairly quiet move inside what options were pricing (+/- 1.6%). The VIX was lower on the week and its closing low Friday near 17 is its lowest level since the late 2021all time market highs. The range on the week was also inside the expected move, with less than a 1.5% difference between the intra-week highs and lows. In other words, IV is low, but realized moves for the past few weeks have been even less.

**This Week – Earnings heat up as IV cools**

SPY options are pricing just a 1.1% move for the upcoming week. That’s as low a move as we’ve seen in quite some time, a factor traders need to be aware of into what could be some idiosyncratic moves in individual stocks as they begin to report. A good example came Friday as several of the large banks reported. The banking system has obviously been a focus for traders the past month, and banks giving insight in that environment would typically come in high vol environment. But because the market had stabilized since the regional bank chaos, the big banks that reported on Friday actually reported in a low IV environment. The result was two of the banks, PNC and Wells Fargo barely moving, well inside their expected moves, while the two that did see moves (JPM and Citi) nearly doubled their expected moves to the upside.

A general rule of thumb on expected moves into earnings is that a stock will stay at or inside its expected move roughly 70% of the time. But the IV backdrop does factor into those numbers. When IV is historically high, it is more likely that a stock stays within its expected move, with the moves outside expectations sometimes massive, but occurring less often. However, when the IV backdrop is low, moves outside expectations tend to happen more often, but the outsized moves themselves tend to be less massive. This makes sense intuitively. Had JPM reported in the middle of the banking turmoil of last month, and shown a net inflow of deposits from regional banks, while its IV, and the market’s overall IV had been alot higher, its move may have been even more. And that’s not just due to sentiment, although that’s a big factor, but it also has to do with the amount of short gamma that is in the market at high IV levels. High IV can create air pockets for stocks to move through. Whereas lower IV backdrops can create a long gamma backdrop, acting as a governor on moves.

The TL:DR version of that is that moves in low-vol environments are smaller overall, with less short gamma in the market. But because the expected move is so much smaller as well, moves outside expectations happen more often. The 4 banks that reported Friday are a small sample size, but the fact that two barely moved, and the other two doubled their expected move on a move that would have been considered normal just a few weeks ago, is a good illustration.

So what does that mean for trade strategies? Credit spreads create really tight windows for a stock to stay within, and it will often be self-fulfilling. The fact that the SPY’s last two weeks saw moves of just 0.4% and 0.8% is indicative of that. However, when a stock does violate that expected move, it won’t take much, and is likely to happen slightly more often. Credit Spreads should be defined risk because the premium received is not enough to make up for the fact that a % move of a couple percent could be a 4x loss. And debit spreads could look to take advantage of that as well. For instance, the likelihood of a massive move on earnings of 20% in a low IV/long gamma environment of a stock expecting a 5% move is very unlikely, however, that stock moving 6-7%, slightly beyond the expected move will happen more often. And because of that, a debit spread at the expected move could see a 3-4x return when that stock goes beyond expectations.

E.G., a stock trading $100 with a 5% expected move, the trader looking to sell premium should be very careful to define risk narrowly, perhaps a dollar wide at or beyond the expected move, so that a move to $92 or $108 (beyond the tight $95 to $105 expected move) doesn’t cause outsized losses. And on the flipside, there can be an opportunity for a long premium trader looking for a move beyond $95 or $105, with say a 105/106 call spread or a 95/94 put spread, rather than a lotto ticket call or put. The chances that the stock will make a massive move is less likely, but the chance it will move slightly beyond the move, is a slightly more frequent occurrence in low IV.

*Note, although a 17 VIX is the lowest level for the past few years, it isn’t super low historically and could just be a blip before it goes higher, or it could go much lower (mid to low teens is historically low). However, it is now lower than the historical mean, something we haven’t seen much of in recent years*.

After last Friday’s upbeat jobs report, May rate hike probability jumped to 72% however market is still pricing in 1-2 rate cuts this year.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company said Monday that its revenue fell 15% in March from a year earlier, marking the first drop in nearly four years, suggesting softer than expected demand from downstream electronic companies (e.g. Apple etc). TSMC has slashed its capital spending plans for this year to a range of $32 billion to $36 billion, down from $36.3 billion last year, creating headwinds for upstream semiconductor suppliers. But the executives said that they expect the company’s sales in the first half to decline by a mid-to-high single-digit percentage in US dollar terms, but that business would pick up in the second half.

My current estimations:

Base case: earnings close to current estimation, however, inflation is stickier than expected, not Fed cut by year-end.

Bull case: earnings close to current estimation, however, inflation is down without large job loss; Fed hint cutting in 2024.

Bear case: earnings come in lower than expectation, however, inflation is still sticky, no Fed cut by year-end.

# [S&amp;P 500 futures decline to start the week as investors’ recession fears grow: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/09/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)
*****
&gt; S&amp;P 500 futures declined on Monday, as investors looked ahead to key inflation data and the start of first-quarter earnings season.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the broad market S&amp;P 500 fell 0.18%, and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures was little changed. Nasdaq 100 futures shed 0.49%.
*****
&gt; On Thursday, the major averages rose to end a holiday-shortened trading week. However, only the Dow notched a weekly gain of 0.6% while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite posted weekly losses, ending lower by 0.1% and 1.1%, respectively.
*****
&gt; The market was volatile as economic data showed signs of a weakening labor market. The March jobs report on Friday showed a resilient economy and moderate inflation, however, which pushed stock futures and Treasury yields higher. The New York Stock Exchange was closed for Good Friday.
*****
&gt; Nonfarm payrolls grew by 236,000 for the month, about in line with the Dow Jones estimate of 238,000, the Labor Department reported. The unemployment fell to 3.5%, against expectations that it would hold from the previous month at 3.6%.
*****
&gt; Investors are in for a busy week of economic data, including the latest consumer price index and producer price index data – due out Wednesday and Thursday, respectively – which will be key in determining if or when the Fed will pause or put an end to its rate hiking campaign.
*****
&gt; “Our guess is the equity market needs economic Goldilocks, a bit of slowing to continue to cool inflation expectations, but not too much to spark ‘hard landing’ fears,” Raymond James’ Tavis C. McCourt wrote in a Sunday note.
*****
&gt; They’ll also get the first batch of companies reporting first-quarter financial results. Tilray Brands kicks things off Monday. The major banks – JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup – will report on Friday.

# [S&amp;P 500 futures decline to start the week as investors’ recession fears grow: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/09/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)
*****
&gt; S&amp;P 500 futures declined on Monday, as investors looked ahead to key inflation data and the start of first-quarter earnings season.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the broad market S&amp;P 500 fell 0.18%, and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures was little changed. Nasdaq 100 futures shed 0.49%.
*****
&gt; On Thursday, the major averages rose to end a holiday-shortened trading week. However, only the Dow notched a weekly gain of 0.6% while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite posted weekly losses, ending lower by 0.1% and 1.1%, respectively.
*****
&gt; The market was volatile as economic data showed signs of a weakening labor market. The March jobs report on Friday showed a resilient economy and moderate inflation, however, which pushed stock futures and Treasury yields higher. The New York Stock Exchange was closed for Good Friday.
*****
&gt; Nonfarm payrolls grew by 236,000 for the month, about in line with the Dow Jones estimate of 238,000, the Labor Department reported. The unemployment fell to 3.5%, against expectations that it would hold from the previous month at 3.6%.
*****
&gt; Investors are in for a busy week of economic data, including the latest consumer price index and producer price index data – due out Wednesday and Thursday, respectively – which will be key in determining if or when the Fed will pause or put an end to its rate hiking campaign.
*****
&gt; “Our guess is the equity market needs economic Goldilocks, a bit of slowing to continue to cool inflation expectations, but not too much to spark ‘hard landing’ fears,” Raymond James’ Tavis C. McCourt wrote in a Sunday note.
*****
&gt; They’ll also get the first batch of companies reporting first-quarter financial results. Tilray Brands kicks things off Monday. The major banks – JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup – will report on Friday.

80,TSM,Taiwan Semi Posts First Fall in Monthly Revenue in Years as Macro Headwinds Hit Chips,"https://www.barrons.com/amp/articles/taiwan-semiconductor-manufacturing-revenue-4ba5eeaa

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing reported its first drop in monthly revenue in almost four years as macroeconomic headwinds hit the world’s largest maker of computer chips, putting the group’s first-quarter earnings due April 20 in the spotlight.

TSMC (ticker: TSM) reported revenue of 145.4 billion Taiwanese dollars in March ($4.8 billion), down 11% from February and falling 15% from March 2022. It’s the first annual drop in monthly revenue since May 2019, according to Dow Jones Newswires.

The chip making giant flagged in January that “as overall macroeconomic conditions remain weak, we expect our business to be further impacted by continued end market demand softness, and customers’ further inventory adjustment” in the first quarter. 

But softness in March may have ushered in a poorer performance than expected for the first three months of 2023, which has the potential to bite investors.

TSMC disclosed in its monthly report that January through March revenue was NT$508.6 billion, up 3.6% from the first quarter of 2022 and—at $16.7 billion in U.S. dollars—at the bottom of the previous range of $16.7 billion to $17.5 billion. Analysts expected a better performance to start the year, with the consensus first-quarter revenue estimate among brokers surveyed by FactSet as of Monday remaining at NT$525.9 billion.

Now that TSMC has disclosed lower revenue in March, leading to first-quarter sales at the bottom of its forecast, analysts’ estimates could be revised lower.",32,8,1681130098.0,2023-04-10T12:34:58+00:00,t3_12hhhp2,stocks

34,TSM,Addressing Semiconductor Supply Chain Risks - Time to Diversify?,"Several major semiconductor manufacturers have significant supply chain risk due to their reliance on Taiwan for chip production. Some of the most notable companies with considerable supply chain risk from Taiwan include:

NVIDIA: As a leading player in the semiconductor market, NVIDIA relies heavily on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) for the production of its high-performance GPUs and AI chips.

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD): AMD, another significant player in the semiconductor industry, is also heavily reliant on TSMC for manufacturing its processors and graphics chips.

Apple: As one of the largest technology companies globally, Apple depends on TSMC for producing its custom-designed processors, such as the A-series chips for iPhones and iPads and the M-series chips for Mac computers.

Qualcomm: This leading semiconductor company, which designs and markets wireless telecommunications products and services, relies on TSMC for the production of its Snapdragon processors used in smartphones and other devices.

Broadcom: Broadcom, a major designer, developer, and supplier of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions, also depends on TSMC for manufacturing its chips.

These companies, among others, face considerable supply chain risk due to their dependence on Taiwan's semiconductor manufacturing capabilities. Disruptions in Taiwan's production capacity, caused by geopolitical tensions, natural disasters, or other unforeseen events, could have significant impacts on these companies and their customers. Therefore, it is crucial for these manufacturers to consider strategies for diversifying their supply chains and mitigating the risks associated with overreliance on Taiwan.",0,9,1679569183.0,2023-03-23T10:59:43+00:00,t3_11zgtno,wallstreetbets

76,TSM,"Taiwan chip export plunges, China still lags amid U.S. restriction","Taiwan’s exports of integrated circuit chips to China fell for a fourth month in February as Washington-Beijing tensions simmer and demand for electronics continues to cool down.

https://preview.redd.it/oshicj8182pa1.png?width=688&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d17b23cfd252b81f98161759013e90414cc4d9e

The self-governing island’s exports of IC chips, which are pivotal components of electronic appliances, computers, and smartphones, to China mainland and Hong Kong dropped 31.3% from a year earlier. It was the worst decline since 2009, even topping January’s 27.1% fall. According to data compiled by Bloomberg, China's market share of Taiwan-made chips plummeted to the lowest level since February 2019 due to the nearly one-third decline.

Taiwan is the world’s largest producer of cutting-edge chips, and demand for the advanced technology that has bolstered its economy has dropped rapidly. The fall is hastening as Taiwan comes in as a geopolitical hotspot.

As China attempts to develop its own advanced technologies, the US has taken steps to prevent the world’s second-largest economy from doing so. In January, the Biden administration reached an agreement with the Netherlands and Japan to restrict exports of some advanced chipmaking machinery to China.

Taiwan-based [TSMC](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NYSE-TSM/) is regarded as the “sacred mountain protecting the island” because of its economic importance. Last year, the semiconductor giant announced its second chip plant in Arizona with an increased $40 billion investment for further partnership with the U.S..

The semiconductor giant’s founder Morris Chang said last Thursday that he supported U.S. efforts to slow China's advances in the semiconductor industry. [TSMC](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NYSE-TSM/) is the most valuable listed company in Asia and a major Apple Inc. supplier.

""There's no question in my mind that, in the chip sector, globalization is dead. Free trade is not quite that dead, but it's in danger,"" Morris Chang said, speaking at an event.

As Taiwan, the island that China views as its territory, plays a more “rebellious” role between U.S. and China, especially in flaed-up competition for advanced technology, Beijing turns to give domestic chipmakers new founding access after a sweeping graft probe in the chip industry last year.

China-based Huawei, Chipmakers Semiconductor Manufacturing International (SMIC), Hua Hong Semiconductor, and other equipment suppliers will be among those benefiting from the policy shift, according to Financial Times’ report.

“The Chinese government will subsidize these companies to produce and deploy localized chipmaking tools without any funding cap, just in order to overcome US restrictions,” said one person with direct knowledge of the policy shift.

China needs to accelerate the development of homegrown replacements in face of the U.S. and its allies’ restrictions, but it would not be an easy task. [TSMC](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NYSE-TSM/)’s Chang said China's chip manufacturing technology lags that of Taiwan by ""at least five or six years"", although Beijing is pouring billions into supporting its chip sector.

# [Stock futures fall Wednesday as investors process inflation data: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/14/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures slipped Wednesday following the release of January’s hotter-than-anticipated consumer price index.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures lost 83 points, or 0.2%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures fell by 0.4% and 0.5%, respectively.
*****
&gt; The Dow fell during the trading session and closed lower by more than 156 points. The S&amp;P 500 remained relatively flat, dropping 0.03%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite shook off earlier losses to close 0.57% higher.
*****
&gt; Inflation data for January came slightly above economists’ estimates, indicating a potentially longer path in the Federal Reserve’s fight against rising prices. The consumer price index increased by 0.5% for the month and 6.4% from the prior year, compared to estimates of 0.4% monthly and 6.2% annually, according to Dow Jones’ survey of economists.
*****
&gt; Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, noted that while inflation remains above the Fed’s target rate of 2%, the higher-than-expected numbers weren’t entirely surprising.
*****
&gt; “The inflation came in with expectations, and I think that’s why the market took it in stride,” he said on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.” Commenting on the monthly uptick in inflation data, Yardeni added, “I think we’re going to have some bumps along the road. But all in all, I think we are certainly seeing strong disinflation.”
*****
&gt; However, he added that despite anticipating a soft landing for the economy, he doesn’t expect the Fed to cut interest rates this year.
*****
&gt; Biogen and Kraft Heinz will be reporting their quarterly earnings on Wednesday before the bell.
*****
&gt; Investors will also be looking toward the latest retail sales data to gauge consumer demand. The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index, industrial production and business inventories data will be released on Wednesday morning.

78,TSM,"Valuing Semiconductor manufacturers and a look at INTC, AMD, TSM and MU","I would like to build a position in a semiconductor manufacturer as their valuations come under pressure in the downturn for this cycle. I intend to look at the data they release in the upcoming earnings reports. As I look at that information what do you think are the most critical components of it to determine the outlook for these companies? I'm currently looking at their PE, Forward PE, Price to Earnings Growth and Price to Free Cash Flow. Stocks on my list at the moment are INTC, AMD, TSM and MU. This is in part because I'd like to buy an even lot eventually so that I can hedge and potentially profit with options. 

As I see it right now INTC is a multiyear recovery story with a high dividend that may need to come down with all the capital outlay involved in their turnaround despite having plenty of free cash flow. While their PE looks cheap compared to some others their FPE looks about inline and analysts don't see much more room to the upside. I am wary.

AMD looks like it has some potential despite having a high current PE their FPE looks to be a little but mostly inline. Their Price to Earnings Growth and Free Cash Flow look less attractive but at the moment analysts are still calling for some reasonable upside to the stock.

TSM looks to be growing well according to the Price to Earnings Growth but the stock price has mostly priced that in and the Free Cashflow looks to be under pressure. Its 2.47% dividend is potentially under even more pressure than INTC according to the financials as it commits to expanding here in the states.

Lastly MU seems to be struggling the most with Cash Flow out of the four and potentially hitting a growth slowdown. 

Thoughts about the companies themselves and advice about trying to determine the value of these businesses going forward are much appreciated.",14,37,1674326998.0,2023-01-21T18:49:58+00:00,t3_10hyf98,investing

36,TSM,TSM (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) posts weak Q4 results - But still up 6.4%,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), the world's largest contract chip maker, reported better-than-expected earnings in the fourth quarter but missed on sales. The company also provided below-average guidance for the current quarter as demand for chips weakens. Despite this, TSM's stock rose in early trading.

For the December quarter, TSMC earned $1.82 per U.S. share on sales of $19.93 billion. Analysts had predicted earnings of $1.80 per share and sales of $20.6 billion. Compared to the same period last year, TSMC's earnings increased by 57% and sales grew by 30%.

TSMC forecasted sales for the current quarter to be between $16.7 billion and $17.5 billion. The midpoint of $17.1 billion falls below Wall Street's target of $17.65 billion. This implies a year-over-year sales growth of just 1% for the first quarter. 

**What they're saying:** ""Our fourth-quarter business was affected by weakened end-market demand and customers' inventory adjustments, despite the ongoing ramp-up of our industry-leading 5-nanometer technologies,"" said Chief Financial Officer Wendell Huang in a statement. He also mentioned that due to weak macroeconomic conditions, the company expects to see further impact on its business in the first quarter of 2023.

TSMC noted that there has been a decrease in demand for data center chips, while demand for chips for smartphones and consumer electronics remains weak. The company projects low single-digit percentage growth for 2023 and implies that the second quarter may mark the lowest point for revenue for the year.

Analysts have mixed reactions to the report, with some reiterating their buy ratings on TSM stock and others maintaining a neutral rating.

# [Stock futures rise slightly in runup to key inflation data](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/11/stock-market-news-futures-open-to-close.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures advanced Thursday as investors awaited a key inflation report to assess the outlook for the Federal Reserve’s rate-hiking campaign.
*****
&gt; Futures linked to the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 87 points, or 0.3%. S&amp;P 500 futures were up 0.3%, while Nasdaq-100 futures added 0.2%.
*****
&gt; All eyes are on December’s consumer price index reading with the consensus forecast calling for a slight easing in price pressures.
*****
&gt; Economists expect the consumer price index to dip 0.1% for December but rise 6.5% year-over-year, compared to a 0.1% monthly gain in November and an annual pace of 7.1%, according to Dow Jones. The CPI is well off the 9.1% peak rate in June.
*****
&gt; Excluding food and energy prices, economists expect the CPI for December will be 0.3% higher than the prior month and 5.7% higher than a year ago.
*****
&gt; “Inflation should continue to decline, leading to an end to Fed rate hikes this spring, keeping interest rates in check, and buoying corporate profits,” Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial, said in a note.
*****
&gt; Stocks rallied Wednesday ahead of the inflation report as investors bet that the Fed could slow down its rate hikes in light of tamer prices. The Dow climbed more than 260 points, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 1.3% with all 11 sectors ending the day higher. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite advanced 1.8% Wednesday, notching a four-day streak.

*****
&gt; Stock futures rose Wednesday as Wall Street looked to build on what has been a positive start to 2023 so far.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 94 points, or 0.3%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures each gained 0.3%.
*****
&gt; The moves come after the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.01% on Tuesday to clinch its first three-day winning streak since November. The S&amp;P 500 and Dow rose 0.70% and 0.56%, respectively, and all three averages are positive for the young year.
*****
&gt; 2023 has brought a relief rally so far for more risky areas of the market, such as tech, but many investors are still cautious ahead of earnings season and further expected rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.
*****
&gt; “I think it is going to be a challenge to try to time when the Fed will ultimately start to cut rates,” said Matthew Palazzolo, senior investment strategist at Bernstein Private Wealth Management. “There is some evidence that when rates start to decline from the Federal Reserve, better markets are ahead. But whether that ends up being in 2024 or late 2023, at least at this point in time, sitting the middle of January, it’s just too difficult a situation.”
*****
&gt; Wednesday features a light schedule for economic data, but investors will be gearing up for a key inflation report on Thursday and major bank earnings on Friday.

**Last Week – A Rally to Start 2023, Powered by NFP**

SPY closed 1.5% higher for the first trading week of 2023, largely on the back of Friday’s positive market reaction to employment and wage data. The VIX is now near 21, down slightly on the week. But options for this week are comparatively high, more on that in a second.

**This Week – Options expecting movement for CPI, Earnings Season Gets Real with the Banks**.

SPY options are pricing a 2.2% move for this week. The primary uncertainty for the markets this week is the CPI release, which will arrive pre-market Thursday morning. The SPY expected move chart via Options AI shows low IV into the release and the majority of this week’s expected move and an IV spike for Thursday:

54,TSM,Can someone recommend some good companies to wheel in this bear market?,"I got these
1. MSFT
2. DIS
3. AMD
4. NKE
5. TSM
6. PFE

Reasonably liquid, reasonably high IV sometimes, good company set to do well - although price dropped quite a bit..

My plan is to
1. Buy on very red days (with patience!) sell ITM, 2-3 weeks out covered calls with expected gain of ~3% (usually required strike to be ~3% lower than current price). 
2. Good case scenario, the shares get called away and I get 3% gain. No strings attached. I get my capital back.
3. Bad case scenario, the stock fall below strike, but I should be reasonably hedged against significant downside risk. I then continue to sell ITM calls and to have breakeven above my original cost basis (price - calls sold).

Considering we are in a bear market, I’m not very comfortable picking Pennies. I’d rather hold some shares of good companies.

This strategy can probably generate ~3% per month with most hits and some misses. So it might reach 30%+ per year? But overall should provide stable returns? 

Example: (let’s say it’s a red day)

https://i.imgur.com/uYpFpFB.jpg

MSFT price 225. Sell 3 weeks out, 220 call for 11 premium with breakeven 231 (~3% gain). downside protected for 214 (5% drawdown protected). So even if it fell below 220. As long as it’s above 214. I can even sell and profit!",16,83,1673072411.0,2023-01-07T06:20:11+00:00,t3_105huwb,thetagang

80,TSM,"Why Buffet just bought 60m Shares of TSMC, and should you?","Berkshire Hathaway had just invested $4.1B in $TSM (TSMC), which translates to 60.1 million shares of Taiwan Semiconductors shares. For those who are not familiar with the semiconductor industry, TSMC is one of the most dominating semiconductors companies in the world currently, working closely with companies like Apple, and competing with the giants $INTC $AMD and $NVDA.

**Why did Warren Buffet buy TSMC now?**

Warren Buffet stock picking strategy is pretty straightforward - companies with optimistic long-term prospects, sound financial health and profitability, and relatively low price-earning (PE) and price-to-book (PB) ratios. With strong EPS growth, P/E at one of its lowest points since 2012, it seems TSMC's Q3 fall made it a good opportunity in the eyes of Buffet.

**Taiwan-China Risk for TSMC**

One of the main risks of investing in Taiwanian companies these days is the ongoing geopolitical crisis between China and Taiwan. In TSMC's case, just 10% of TSMC’s revenue comes from China, while 50% is USA. This puts TSMC in a very good position against this crisis, as China needs TSMC more than the other way around. I can only guess Warren Buffet simply doesn't see China as a threat to the company.

**Buffet Trims 20% of BYD for TSMC - What does it mean?**

Buffet's position in $BYDDY , an EV auto company, was partly replaced with the new TSMC position. While many analysts believe Buffet's decision signals that he sees better prospects in semiconductors than electrical vehicles (EV), I believe Buffet simply sees the EV market as an overpriced market.

**Should you invest in TSMC?**

My take - TSMC is a great value investment. A profitable company that paid stable cash dividends over 2 decades, and it maintained growth momentum despite the current downturn in tech. No doubt what's holding this stock right now is the China-Taiwan war, resulting in fearful investors that keep the stock undervalued. The major risk here is if China decides to invade Taiwan, other than that, TSMC is at a pretty clear buy point.

81,TSM,Stumped on my 8th stock to pick in my portfolio(s).,"Title says all, but truthfully don't know who to ask so this place seems like a good place to throw some ideas around.  

My current portfolio is currently and only concentrated in 7 stocks, there's a fair bit of diversity in it but it's mainly weighted on tech.  I'll give a list for what I got and my reasoning for each, beyond the obvious that tech seems here to stay for many years (which is my goal for these accounts, retirement).  

1.  AMD - Makes excellent processors, seems to be if not already beating Intel in market share and technology due to their head start with their newer CPUs.  
2.  MSFT - I don't think this needs elaboration.
3.  RTX - Government defense contracts are a big reason, but they also own United Technologies now, which is a big manufacturer for HVAC components among other things, and in the future I see HVAC use trending upwards (if nothing else climate change will make things way hotter).  
4.  TFC - Truist Financial, This is my bank is is actually a regional bank.  But they are also the 10th largest bank in the US with assets ($509 Billion).  Stock is just solid.  
5.  TSM - They contract with both Intel and AMD for their processors.  So if nothing else, if Intel and AMD should fail, either move the losses to TSM or just get out of tech in general.  China poses a potential issue but I see this is a non-issue due to the rest of the world's reliance on Taiwan for their semiconductor production.  
6.  VZ - Telecommunications company, I picked it over AT&amp;T because it has far less debt.  This is the dividend stock of the group.  
7.  WMG - Warner Music Group, I would have rather picked UMG but they're not public.  Music royalties mainly,  they have quite a few artist I like in their catalog.  

Now, a preface:  should this be taken as due diligence for anyone?  No, not really, these are just MY personal picks, and I'm just trying to even it out because I don't like odd numbers.  All of these companies could fail in the future and I'd sell at a loss and put it into SPY like the rest of us.  But one of the best pieces of advice I ever heard was ""invest in things you understand"", and all of these are industries I've either worked in or am very familiar with.  I'm not investing expert.  

That said, I want my next pick to be something a bit more old money conservative, so I've been considering some more unorthodox options - like SPGI or CME.  Something that tracks the market (or literally OWNS the tracker, in these cases).  BRK.B also seems like a strong choice.

86,TSM,I now understand what Warren Buffet means about buying the whole company (TSM),"I remember seeing clips where Buffet has given advice bout buying a stock as if he is buying the whole company. Clearly for him, this is a realistic scenario but not for almost everyone else - certainly those watching his comments for 'tips'.

Well my journey has come full circle in the past week with TSM (Taiwan Semiconductor). This was 1st on my radar earlier this year and some very quick research told me they were big, made 50% of global semiconductors and had been hit by the supply chain issues affecting much of the Asian market.

I decided I would buy in, but would be committed and go in for the long term and generally start focussing on fewer stocks. I 1st purchased on 2nd March at $108 and steadily increased my position most months. The result was, that despite the falling market and my initial holding being savaged, I was able to reduce my average price to $80.

Last week Warren Buffet bought $4 billion worth of shares and my position is now in positive territory.

I now realise how stupid it has been to buy in smaller positions stocks without being fully committed to a holding and to keep buying it. Toe dipping is fine, but the opportunity cost is that it can tie up a chunk of funds and not allow you to commit to the bets you feel you should commit to.",25,56,1668848796.0,2022-11-19T09:06:36+00:00,t3_yz7p2i,stocks

38,TSM,Apple plans to source chips from Arizona plant that’s set to open in 2024: report," 

[Bloomberg News reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-15/apple-prepares-to-get-made-in-us-chips-in-pivot-from-asia-supply?srnd=premium&amp;sref=Oeyjq8by) Tuesday that Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook recently said during an internal meeting in Germany that the tech giant is preparing to buy chips from “a plant in Arizona,” which is expected to go online in 2024. Cook reportedly added that Apple will likely buy more European-made chips as well.

That’s all in an effort to reduce its reliance on chip manufacturing from Asia, which has been plagued by COVID-19 and shipping disruptions in recent years. Apple has been working to remake its supply chain, with dozens of its parts suppliers [adding manufacturing facilities in the U.S.](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-suppliers-add-manufacturing-sites-in-u-s-with-focus-on-california-11664912415?mod=article_inline) in fiscal 2021, according to a supplier list released by Apple in October.

The Arizona plant Cook referred to is likely [the $12 billion facility](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/taiwan-semiconductor-to-build-12-billion-chip-factory-in-arizona-2020-05-15?mod=article_inline) north of Phoenix being built by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which was announced in 2020. TSMC is the world’s largest contract manufacturer of silicon chips and is Apple’s chip-making partner.

Last week, [the Wall Street Journal reported](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chip-making-juggernaut-tsmc-eyes-multibillion-dollar-arizona-factory-expansion-11667973859?mod=article_inline) TSMC would expand that facility, which could serve as a second manufacturing plant.

TSMC’s U.S. shares surged more than 10% on Tuesday after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. [disclosed a significant stake Monday](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/berkshire-hathaway-discloses-stakes-in-tsmc-jefferies-louisiana-pacific-sending-those-stocks-higher-11668464901?mod=article_inline).

11,TSM,Keeping things in perspective,"I was reviewing my portfolio, and was feeling pretty down by its performance.  Before I do, I like to keep the returns of the indices in mind. It is the only for me to determine whether my methods are still working or not. Just so you know, I invest only in equities, including gold mining, REITs, and hedging ETFs. I do not invest in bonds, but I will keep some cash on hand in case there is an opportunity too good to pass.  Thank you Elon Musk for the nice little Twitter bonus. I also use covered calls with one year contracts to enhance my income. I only rebalance and reassess the third Friday in January. That keeps me from being totally reactive to market gyrations.

Based on total return, the S&amp;P 500 is down -15.1% this year. The Vanguard Total Bond Fund is down -15.69% this year. If that holds up, it would be an example proving that this is the worst year for bonds since 1793 (yes, you read that right). 

So far this year, I am only down 11%.  I know that is not something to write home about, but I will write it down here, it does give me faith that what I did work. The key is focus on quality companies that generate growing revenues, increasing profits, and have strong balance sheets.  I do use some literal calculus to determine a fair present value, so I don't overpay on my holdings.

60,TSM,Advice on building a credit spread strategy,"Hey all, 

I’m hoping for tips/criticism on my credit spread strategy I’m attempting to establish. I believe that when investing you should establish a system, and stick to it. This minimizes the amount of decisions you have to make and allows you to focus on the few decisions you do make. 

I’ve decided on credit spreads as shorting options can generate income, makes money on a flat market, and has limited loss. I can’t ever guess the direction of the markets, but with this system I’m trying to build the goal is that i won’t have to.  The goal of this system is to eliminate the movement of the market-and focus the success of each investment down to simply picking how one stock performs relative to another. 

Here are the rules I have in place

1. Sell a blend of put and call credit spreads, with a ratio of 50/50 of each. This way I’m hedged against market swings. 

2. The long and short positions are to be on firms within the same industry-to avoid risk of industry specific news. (Ex. Long LRCX short TSM). 

3. The spreads sold will be OTM- this is to allow the trade to be max profit on a flat market. The spread will have as narrow as possible of a max loss/max profit difference. (Max profit needs to be at least 50% of max loss, Ideally 75%+)

4. The options sold will be short dated-weeklies. They should lose value faster than longer dated options due to exponential decay of time value

5. Stay as diverse as possible. By heavily diversifying I can improve my chances of profit. It’s 50/50 whether any trade will generate profit or loss. If I’m heavily diversified, some percentage of these spreads will have an underlying that trades flat, which is what should push this strategy into profitability. 


One thing I could use help on is an exit strategy. Currently the plan is to take profit at 50% of max. How can I structure stop losses to improve profitability?

Any advice is welcome. Thanks.",9,12,1666541778.0,2022-10-23T16:16:18+00:00,t3_yblri1,options

Taiwan makes 60% of the world's semiconductors and 90% of the advanced chips, mostly because of TSM, but also Mediatek and UMC are located in Taiwan.

# [Stock futures rise ahead of key inflation data, Fed minutes](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/11/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures rose Wednesday as investors awaited the latest inflation numbers and the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s latest meeting.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 151 points, or 0.53%. S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.69% and 0.89%, respectively.
*****
&gt; The moves came after the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite fell 0.65% and 1.1%, respectively, to post their fifth straight day of declines. The Dow ended the day on a higher note, up about 36 points, but gave back most of its gains from a rally earlier in the session.
*****
&gt; Stocks fell from their highs, and bond yields ticked up, when the Bank of England said its market intervention will be over soon and pension funds have just three days to rebalance positions.
*****
&gt; Investors are looking forward to the September producer price index, a gauge of final-demand wholesale prices, due to be released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Wednesday. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones are expecting headline PPI to increase 0.2%, after declining 0.1% in the previous month.
*****
&gt; The minutes from the Federal Reserve’s September meeting will also be released Wednesday. While Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has acknowledged that aggressive interest rate increases could be painful, the central bank will continue to charge forward in its fight to lower inflation.
*****
&gt; “Powell has repeated, in what has become his mantra, that without price stability we cannot have a strong economy or a strong labor market,” said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial. “Investors are concerned that restrictive monetary policy, that is, tighter financial conditions, could lead to the kind of financial accident that dries up liquidity and delivers more harm to the global economy.”

Browsing through the investment subs, I can see it's getting much more depressing recently, including the news/article from those paid investment websites. 

I am quite excited to have an even better chance increase the positions for all of my current investments. In these times, are you buying stocks? or ETF? 

According to some of investment philosophies, it is now a good time to buy (well, unless you might point out that when it's really time to buy, these types of post like this wouldn't even appear). 

Bad news gets more attention than good news; albeit the current bad ones are global and systematic, but I believe good companies will still get through and be benefit from it.

# [Stock futures are flat after the Nasdaq Composite closes at a 2-year low](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/10/stock-futures-are-little-changed-after-the-nasdaq-composite-closes-at-a-2-year-low.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures were flat Tuesday after the Nasdaq Composite closed at its lowest in two years during the regular session.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures traded higher by 40 points, or 0.13%, rebounding from a slump that took the index down about 200 points in premarket trading. S&amp;P 500 futures rose 0.02% while Nasdaq 100 futures slipped 0.03%.
*****
&gt; Stocks closed lower Monday, with the Nasdaq Composite falling 1% following a drop in semiconductor stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed nearly 94 points, or 0.3%, while the S&amp;P 500 declined about 0.8%.
*****
&gt; Bond prices also fell. The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury rose about five basis points to 3.937% after nearing the key 4% level overnight. Bond yields are inverse to prices, and a basis point is one hundredth of one percent.
*****
&gt; The moves came as investors weighed comments from JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, who warned that the U.S. would likely fall into a recession over the next “six to nine months,” and said the S&amp;P 500 could fall another 20% depending on whether the Federal Reserve engineers a soft or a hard landing for the economy.
*****
&gt; Those remarks came at the start of a big week for third quarter bank earnings, and ahead of Wednesday’s producer price report, Thursday’s consumer price index report for September and Friday’s retail sales numbers, also for last month.
*****
&gt; Investor reaction is focused solely on how the Federal Reserve will react to the economy as it works to dampen inflation.
*****
&gt; “There’s always this idea of a Fed pivot coming right around the corner, and they’re just going to tighten their belts to bring inflation down without affecting the economy more broadly,” Dan Greenhaus, chief strategist and economist at Solus Alternative Asset Management, said Monday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.”
*****
&gt; “All of that was always hopes and dreams. And the most likely outcome was ... what history shows always happens, which is the Fed tightens, they tighten too much, they cause an economic dislocation, the market goes down. Full stop,” he added.

279,TSM,Semiconductor route wipes out $240 Billion from chipmakers - TSMC drops 8.3% and Samsung and Tokyo Electron also declined.,"Asia’s top chip stocks tumbled Tuesday, ensnared in an escalating US-China tech race that has erased more than $240 billion from the sector’s global market value.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s largest contract chipmaker, plunged a record 8.3% while Samsung Electronics Co. and Tokyo Electron Ltd. also declined.  The selloff spread to the foreign-exchange market as investors tallied up the damage from the sweeping curbs the US is imposing on companies that conduct technology business with China.

The Biden administration measures erect barriers of entry to China’s market by limiting the ability of US firms to sell equipment and tech to their Chinese counterparts. There are concerns that the restrictions could spread if Washington widens the initiative to include other countries, while questions also remain over the scope and final impact of the moves.

The US announced the export curbs Friday, and there have been suggestions that similar actions may be deployed in other countries to ensure international cooperation. The announcement spurred a two-day rout of over 9% in the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index that saw it close Monday at its lowest level since November 2020. Markets in Korea, Japan and Taiwan were shut that day for holidays. 

The US measures include restrictions on the export of some types of chips used in artificial intelligence and supercomputing, and also tighter rules on the sale of semiconductor equipment to any Chinese company. Washington also added more Chinese firms to a list of companies that it regards as “unverified,” which means US suppliers will face new hurdles in selling technologies to those entities. 

 “It is difficult to call a bottom on the performance of the chip sector,” said Gary Dugan, chief executive officer of the Global CIO Office. “The big story is that the West is becoming profoundly more concerned about security around any form of technology. We see no reason to re-enter the sector for the moment despite the profound poor performance.” 

US chip stocks were on track to decline for a third day, with Nvidia Corp., Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Qualcomm Inc. and Texas Instruments Inc. all down more than 1% before the bell. Chip-tool maker ASML Holding NV traded down 2.3% in Amsterdam, bringing three-day losses to more than 11%.

*****
&gt; Stock futures were lower Monday morning as the markets come out of a tumultuous week and traders look ahead to key reports coming in the next week that can offer insights into the health of the economy.
*****
&gt; Futures connected to the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 28 points. S&amp;P 500 futures were lower by 0.18%, while Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.30%.
*****
&gt; Market observers generally consider the week ahead as the kickoff to earnings season, with four of the world’s largest banks – JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley and Citi – reporting Friday. PepsiCo, Delta and Domino’s are also among companies reporting next week.
*****
&gt; Inflation will also take center stage as new monthly Consumer Price Index data comes Thursday morning.
*****
&gt; It will follow a week of whiplash for market participants. The first half of the week brought a relief rally that pushed the S&amp;P 500 up more than 5% in its largest two-day gain since 2020.
*****
&gt; But jobs data that economists say will keep the Federal Reserve on a path to continue raising interest rates and OPEC+’s decision to slash oil supply rattled investors, knocking the market down later in the week. When trading ended Friday, the S&amp;P was up 1.5% compared to where it started the week. The Dow and Nasdaq were up 1.5% and 0.7%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Still, the Dow, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq had the first positive week in the last four. All remain down substantially so far in 2022, however, and the Nasdaq is less than 1% away from its 52-week low.
*****
&gt; “The direction of the stock market is likely to be lower because either the economy and corporate profits are going to slow meaningfully or the Fed is going to have to raise rates even higher and keep them higher for longer,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance, on Friday.
*****
&gt; “Given the conditions that we are operating under, we believe it’s prudent to begin preparing for a recession,” he added. “The talk of a shallow recession that is now the narrative-du-jour strikes us as eerily similar to the ‘inflation is transitory’ narrative of last year.”
*****
&gt; Last week brought heightened concerns that corporate earnings will show the ugly side of a surging dollar as Levi Strauss became the latest to cut guidance due to sliding international sales.

&gt; **Ford (F), General Motors (GM)** – UBS downgraded both automakers, cutting Ford to “sell” from “neutral” and downgrading GM to “neutral” from “buy.” UBS said the auto industry is rapidly moving toward vehicle oversupply following three years of unprecedented pricing power. Ford slid 3.6% in the premarket while GM fell 3.5%.

61,TSM,"Expected moves this week: Dominos, Wells Fargo, JP Morgan, SPY, QQQ and more","## Market View

**Last Week –** SPY was higher by about 1.5% in a wildly volatile week. Stocks saw a large two-day relief rally to begin the week as treasury yields declined, and hopes rose that the Fed was beginning to see evidence that would allow them to slow their aggressive rate hikes. Those hopes were dashed on Friday as the NFP report came in hot. Those numbers are notoriously backward-looking and even if it was the last hot payrolls report, markets seem to decide, that the Fed has cover for continued aggressive rate hikes for the foreseeable future.

The move on the week was inside what options were pricing but the swings in either direction during the week were way outside.

**This Week –** SPY options are again pricing about a 2.9% move for the upcoming week. The VIX ended last week around 31 and implied vol remains near its highs of the year.

**Expected Moves for This Week** (via Options AI)

* SPY **2.9%** (+/- $11)
* QQQ **3.5%** (+/- $11)
* IWM **3.4%** (+/- $6)
* DIA **2.5%** (+/- $7)

* **Thursday** – CPI
* **Friday** – Retail Sales, Consumer Sentiment

&amp;#x200B;

## Earnings Season in High Vol

This week marks the beginning of earnings season, with a lot of eyes on the large banks that report towards the end of the week. Earnings season in a high vol environment means that options need to price both the earnings event itself but also the potential for large market moves into and out of the event.

That means trading the event itself needs to be fairly precise, with strategies placed just before and taken off just after in order to isolate the event itself. Here’s an example, with Wells Fargo (WFC) options pricing in a 5.2% expected move for the week ([Options AI free tool link](https://tools.optionsai.com/companies/WFC)).

&amp;#x200B;

To put that into some very recent perspective. WFC closed last week up nearly 4% and at one point during the week was higher by nearly 8%. The other banks reporting this week are also pricing around 5% moves, more on that below:

# **Dow drops 600 points, Nasdaq closes 3% lower as rates pop after September jobs report - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/06/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks fell Friday as traders evaluated September’s jobs report, which showed the unemployment rate continuing to decline and sparked an increase in interest rates.
 *****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 630.15 points, or 2.1%, to 29,296.79. The S&amp;P 500 lost 2.8% to 3,639.66. The Nasdaq Composite slid 3.8% to 10,652.41, which is less than 1% above its low of the year.
*****
&gt; Friday’s losses trimmed the gains for what started out as a big comeback week for stocks. The major averages still ended the week higher but gave back most of the gains from the rally that kicked it off. The Dow rose 2% for the week, while the S&amp;P added 1.5%. The Nasdaq eked out a 0.7% gain.
*****
&gt; The U.S. economy added 263,000 jobs in September, slightly below a Dow Jones estimate of 275,000, the government said Friday. However, the unemployment rate came in at 3.5%, down from the 3.7% in the previous month in a sign that the jobs picture continues to strengthen even as the Federal Reserve tries to slow the economy with rate hikes to stem inflation.
*****
&gt; 10-year U.S. Treasury yield and the S&amp;P 500 this week
*****
&gt; “While the data was about as expected, the drop in the unemployment rate is seemingly what the markets are obsessed with because of what it means for the Fed,” said Bleakley Financial chief investment officer Peter Boockvar. “When combined with the low level of initial jobless claims, the pace of firing’s remains muted and this of course gets the Fed all fired up about continuing with its aggressive rate hikes.”
*****
&gt; The falling unemployment rate sparked a jump in rates, in turn weighing on stocks. The 2-year year Treasury yield rose 6 basis points to 4.316%. (1 basis point equals 0.01%.)
*****
&gt; Advanced Micro Devices’ stock tumbled after the chipmaker warned its third-quarter revenue would be lower than anticipated. Levi Strauss shares slipped following a cut to the company’s guidance.
*****
&gt; “The conclusion many we have spoken with have reached is that not only will the Fed not help markets, but in their dogged pursuit of price stability keep going until something breaks in the capital markets,” said Christopher Harvey, an equity analyst at Wells Fargo Securities. “What appears to be their increasingly singular focus — price stability — will likely help catalyze the dislocation.”

&gt; # 7 Things to Know About The Historically Strong Fourth Quarter

&gt; “You make most of your money in a bear market, you just don’t realize it at the time.” Shelby Cullom Davis

&gt; We all blinked, and it is now October, which could be good if you are hoping for higher stock prices. But, as this great quote by Shelby Cullom Davis explains, people’s decisions in a bear market will significantly impact their investments down the road.

&gt; Are you going to sell now that stocks are firmly in a bear market? Many investors have done that over the years and missed out on massive rallies as stocks eventually returned to new highs. This year hasn’t been fun at all for investors, but better times could be coming, and making a rash decision now could greatly impact your investments years from now.

&gt; To help with this, today we’ll take a closer look at the fourth quarter and show why a potential year-end rally (and maybe more) could be likely.

&gt; First, the fourth quarter is historically the best quarter of the year, with the S&amp;P 500 up 4.1% on average and nearly 80% of the time.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image001-800x409.png))**

&gt; Second, this is a midterm year, and the good news is that market gains during these years are backloaded. In fact, October is the best month of a midterm year, followed by the second best month in November and the third best in December.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image002-800x338.png))**

&gt; Third, here’s a chart we’ve shared a lot lately, but we’ll do it again, as it is very powerful. Midterm years tend to see weak stock returns in the first three quarters (check for 2022), but the fourth quarter of a midterm is the second-best quarter out of the entire four-year Presidential cycle. The best quarter and third best quarter are right around the corner early next year. As bad as things have been this year, the calendar is currently a major tailwind.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image003-800x302.png))**

&gt; Fourth, the fourth quarter has historically done even better when September is down big. Given this year saw one of the worst Septembers ever for stocks, this could be another clue a bounce back is possible. To quote Lloyd Christmas, “So you’re telling me there’s a chance!”

&gt; Fifth, this was the third worst start to a year ever for the S&amp;P 500. Well, the good news is looking at the ten worst starts ever to a year saw the fourth quarter higher nine times. Only in 2008 was it red; fortunately, we don’t think we are in that environment. Going out a year, the S&amp;P 500 was up eight times and higher, a median of 25.5%.

&gt; Sixth, the S&amp;P 500 bear market cracked down 25% last week. As bad as that feels to investors, the stock market doesn’t care about what just happened and only cares about what is next. The good news is once a bear market is down 25%, the returns going out can be quite strong, with the S&amp;P 500 up nearly 23% on average a year later. Additionally, many lows took place soon after this milestone was hit, so a major low could be near. Yes, the ’73/’74 recession, tech bubble, and financial crisis all saw more weakness (and in some cases for a long time), but we don’t see an economy nearly as weak as those times. Therefore, we think this time will play out like the others, and stronger returns could be quite likely.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image016-800x501.png))**

&gt; Here’s another way of showing the study above. As you can see, many times once the S&amp;P 500 was down 25%, it was quite near a major low.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image010-800x383.png))**

&gt; Seventh and lastly, October is known as a bear market killer. Remember, this year was the worst start to a year since 1974 and 2002. Below we show how bear markets tend to bottom in October, and sure enough, both of those vicious bears ended in October. The ’73/’74 bear ended on October 3, while the tech bubble bear market bottomed on October 9.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image017-800x582.png))**

&gt; Investors are worried, and we understand those feelings here at the Carson Investment Research team. Could stocks bottom and rally? We think there’s an above-average chance. And a chance is all we need, as Lloyd Christmas would say.

&gt; # Bears Remain Above 50%

&gt; The past week's rebound in equity prices has bolstered sentiment a bit as the latest AAII survey showed an increase in bullishness. For the second week in a row, bullish sentiment rose week over week to come in at 23.9%. That is, of course, still below the reading of 26.1% only three weeks ago and even further depressed relative to the historical average.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/100622-AAII-1.png))**

&gt; The pickup in bullish sentiment borrowed from bears. After two consecutive weeks of readings above 60% (the first such occurrence in the history of the survey), bearish sentiment has turned lower falling to 54.8%. As with bullish sentiment, that marks some improvement, but much more progress would need to be made to bring bearish sentiment back in line with the historical average of 30.5%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/100622-AAII-2.png))**

&gt; Although the streak of readings above 60% is over, more than half of the respondents remain bearish. As shown below, that has grown to be the longest streak of such readings since the depths of the COVID Crash. Prior to that, there have only been six other such streaks: four occurring between 2008 and 2009 and the others occurring in August and October of 1990.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/100622-AAII-2a.png))**

&gt; With both bullish and bearish sentiment improving, the bull-bear spread has risen up to -30.9 after hitting the lowest level since 2009 only two weeks ago.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/100622-AAII-3.png))**

&gt; Again, in spite of any improvement, sentiment remains heavily in favor of bears as it has for more than half a year. As shown below, the bull-bear spread has remained negative for 27 weeks in a row. That is the second-longest streak of negative readings on record but would need to continue for another two months to surpass the 2020 record.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/100622-AAII-3a.png))**

&gt; Not all of the losses to bearish sentiment went to bulls. Neutral sentiment also rebounded slightly rising from sub-20% (the lowest level since April 2020) to 21.3%.

&gt; The market may not be down during the Sell Rosh Hashanah/Buy Yom Kippur period which ends today on Yom Kippur 2022. But it sure was a wild ride. Most importantly it lines up perfectly with our Almanac Aggregate Cycle. Back in mid-August this Aggregate Cycle called the end of the summer rally and now it’s pointing to a big move higher.

&gt; You can check the full stats Sell Rosh Hashanah, Buy Yom Kippur, Sell Passover in our September 23 post, but here’s a reminder of the awesome history of rallies from midterm year Yom Kippur to pre-election Passover. DJIA p 10 of 12, average gain 12.0%.

&gt; # Big Bounce in Claims...Or Is It?

&gt; Following a few months of downward trending initial jobless claims bringing the indicator back down around multi-decade lows, there has finally been a significant uptick. Whereas last week's reading was revised lower to an even more impressive 190K (the lowest since April), the latest print soared 29K to 219K. That is only the highest level since the end of August, but it also is back in the range of pre-pandemic readings while also marking the largest week over week increase in claims since the first week of June.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/100622-Claims-1.png))**

&gt; On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, claims rose as might have been expected for the current week of the year. As shown in the second chart below, as far as consistency of week-over-week increases go, the current week of the year is tied with the 2nd and 45th (approximately the weeks of January 8th and November 5th) for fourth as claims have risen 85.5% of the time since 1967. Additionally, before seasonal adjustment, it was not a particularly large increase as the 13.3K WoW rise was half of the average for the comparable week of the year. Even after that increase, unadjusted claims have only been lower during the year's comparable week twice: 1968 and 1969. In other words, a drift higher in claims is normal at this point of the year, and even with that move higher, claims remain nothing short of impressive.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/100622-Claims-2.png))**

&gt; As for continuing claims which are lagged an additional week to the initial claims number, the latest week saw a modest increase of 15K to 1.361 million. That snapped a streak of four consecutive weeks of declines. Whereas seasonally adjusted initial claims have risen back into the pre-pandemic range, continuing claims have only experienced a modest move higher and are well below their own levels from pre-pandemic years.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/100622-Claims-3.png))**

&gt; In the past few months, we have consistently checked in on the ratio of initial jobless claims to continuing claims (both seasonally adjusted) as a measure of the lack of follow-through of the former to the latter. With last week's very strong initial claims number that was more reflective of the still strong continuing claims number, that ratio has now come back in line with the historical average.

&gt; # Market Rebounds 28.2% After Midterm Year Down YTD Q3

&gt; S&amp;P 500 closed September down -24.8% year-to-date – the 4th worst YTD Q3 performance since 1930. Since WWII (1946) when S&amp;P 500 was down YTD at the end of Q3 in midterm year it gained 28.2% on average over the next 5 quarters with no losses.

&gt; In all 23 years the following Q4 was up 69.6 % of the time for an average gain of 3.1%. Subsequent Q1s were up only 52.2% of the time for an average gain of 2.7%. The following Q2s gained ground 65.2% of the time for an average gain of 2.9% and then next years were up 73.9% of the time for an average gain of 11.9%.

&gt; But the record for midterm years down at the end of Q3 is better. Of those nine midterm years highlighted in blue in the table only 1946 into 1947 had no bounce with 1947 closing exactly at the same price as 1946 for S&amp;P. Overall, Q4s were up 88.9% of the time, average gain 7.6%, Q1s up 77.8% of the time, average gain 6.7%, Q2 up 77.8% of the time, average gain 4.6% and next years up 88.9% of the time, average gain 19.2%.

&gt; So, while things look grim out there on Wall Street, economically and globally, odds are we are nearing a bottom and the prospects for Q4 and next year are encouraging, at least historically, seasonally and 4-year cycle-wise. But there is still a lot that needs to go right, and the market likely has further downside left.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 10th, 2022.

# **Dow drops 600 points, Nasdaq closes 3% lower as rates pop after September jobs report - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/06/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks fell Friday as traders evaluated September’s jobs report, which showed the unemployment rate continuing to decline and sparked an increase in interest rates.
 *****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 630.15 points, or 2.1%, to 29,296.79. The S&amp;P 500 lost 2.8% to 3,639.66. The Nasdaq Composite slid 3.8% to 10,652.41, which is less than 1% above its low of the year.
*****
&gt; Friday’s losses trimmed the gains for what started out as a big comeback week for stocks. The major averages still ended the week higher but gave back most of the gains from the rally that kicked it off. The Dow rose 2% for the week, while the S&amp;P added 1.5%. The Nasdaq eked out a 0.7% gain.
*****
&gt; The U.S. economy added 263,000 jobs in September, slightly below a Dow Jones estimate of 275,000, the government said Friday. However, the unemployment rate came in at 3.5%, down from the 3.7% in the previous month in a sign that the jobs picture continues to strengthen even as the Federal Reserve tries to slow the economy with rate hikes to stem inflation.
*****
&gt; 10-year U.S. Treasury yield and the S&amp;P 500 this week
*****
&gt; “While the data was about as expected, the drop in the unemployment rate is seemingly what the markets are obsessed with because of what it means for the Fed,” said Bleakley Financial chief investment officer Peter Boockvar. “When combined with the low level of initial jobless claims, the pace of firing’s remains muted and this of course gets the Fed all fired up about continuing with its aggressive rate hikes.”
*****
&gt; The falling unemployment rate sparked a jump in rates, in turn weighing on stocks. The 2-year year Treasury yield rose 6 basis points to 4.316%. (1 basis point equals 0.01%.)
*****
&gt; Advanced Micro Devices’ stock tumbled after the chipmaker warned its third-quarter revenue would be lower than anticipated. Levi Strauss shares slipped following a cut to the company’s guidance.
*****
&gt; “The conclusion many we have spoken with have reached is that not only will the Fed not help markets, but in their dogged pursuit of price stability keep going until something breaks in the capital markets,” said Christopher Harvey, an equity analyst at Wells Fargo Securities. “What appears to be their increasingly singular focus — price stability — will likely help catalyze the dislocation.”

&gt; # 7 Things to Know About The Historically Strong Fourth Quarter

&gt; “You make most of your money in a bear market, you just don’t realize it at the time.” Shelby Cullom Davis

&gt; We all blinked, and it is now October, which could be good if you are hoping for higher stock prices. But, as this great quote by Shelby Cullom Davis explains, people’s decisions in a bear market will significantly impact their investments down the road.

&gt; Are you going to sell now that stocks are firmly in a bear market? Many investors have done that over the years and missed out on massive rallies as stocks eventually returned to new highs. This year hasn’t been fun at all for investors, but better times could be coming, and making a rash decision now could greatly impact your investments years from now.

&gt; To help with this, today we’ll take a closer look at the fourth quarter and show why a potential year-end rally (and maybe more) could be likely.

&gt; First, the fourth quarter is historically the best quarter of the year, with the S&amp;P 500 up 4.1% on average and nearly 80% of the time.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image001-800x409.png))**

&gt; Second, this is a midterm year, and the good news is that market gains during these years are backloaded. In fact, October is the best month of a midterm year, followed by the second best month in November and the third best in December.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image002-800x338.png))**

&gt; Third, here’s a chart we’ve shared a lot lately, but we’ll do it again, as it is very powerful. Midterm years tend to see weak stock returns in the first three quarters (check for 2022), but the fourth quarter of a midterm is the second-best quarter out of the entire four-year Presidential cycle. The best quarter and third best quarter are right around the corner early next year. As bad as things have been this year, the calendar is currently a major tailwind.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image003-800x302.png))**

&gt; Fourth, the fourth quarter has historically done even better when September is down big. Given this year saw one of the worst Septembers ever for stocks, this could be another clue a bounce back is possible. To quote Lloyd Christmas, “So you’re telling me there’s a chance!”

&gt; Fifth, this was the third worst start to a year ever for the S&amp;P 500. Well, the good news is looking at the ten worst starts ever to a year saw the fourth quarter higher nine times. Only in 2008 was it red; fortunately, we don’t think we are in that environment. Going out a year, the S&amp;P 500 was up eight times and higher, a median of 25.5%.

&gt; Sixth, the S&amp;P 500 bear market cracked down 25% last week. As bad as that feels to investors, the stock market doesn’t care about what just happened and only cares about what is next. The good news is once a bear market is down 25%, the returns going out can be quite strong, with the S&amp;P 500 up nearly 23% on average a year later. Additionally, many lows took place soon after this milestone was hit, so a major low could be near. Yes, the ’73/’74 recession, tech bubble, and financial crisis all saw more weakness (and in some cases for a long time), but we don’t see an economy nearly as weak as those times. Therefore, we think this time will play out like the others, and stronger returns could be quite likely.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image016-800x501.png))**

&gt; Here’s another way of showing the study above. As you can see, many times once the S&amp;P 500 was down 25%, it was quite near a major low.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image010-800x383.png))**

&gt; Seventh and lastly, October is known as a bear market killer. Remember, this year was the worst start to a year since 1974 and 2002. Below we show how bear markets tend to bottom in October, and sure enough, both of those vicious bears ended in October. The ’73/’74 bear ended on October 3, while the tech bubble bear market bottomed on October 9.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image017-800x582.png))**

&gt; Investors are worried, and we understand those feelings here at the Carson Investment Research team. Could stocks bottom and rally? We think there’s an above-average chance. And a chance is all we need, as Lloyd Christmas would say.

&gt; # Bears Remain Above 50%

&gt; The past week's rebound in equity prices has bolstered sentiment a bit as the latest AAII survey showed an increase in bullishness. For the second week in a row, bullish sentiment rose week over week to come in at 23.9%. That is, of course, still below the reading of 26.1% only three weeks ago and even further depressed relative to the historical average.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/100622-AAII-1.png))**

&gt; The pickup in bullish sentiment borrowed from bears. After two consecutive weeks of readings above 60% (the first such occurrence in the history of the survey), bearish sentiment has turned lower falling to 54.8%. As with bullish sentiment, that marks some improvement, but much more progress would need to be made to bring bearish sentiment back in line with the historical average of 30.5%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/100622-AAII-2.png))**

&gt; Although the streak of readings above 60% is over, more than half of the respondents remain bearish. As shown below, that has grown to be the longest streak of such readings since the depths of the COVID Crash. Prior to that, there have only been six other such streaks: four occurring between 2008 and 2009 and the others occurring in August and October of 1990.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/100622-AAII-2a.png))**

&gt; With both bullish and bearish sentiment improving, the bull-bear spread has risen up to -30.9 after hitting the lowest level since 2009 only two weeks ago.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/100622-AAII-3.png))**

&gt; Again, in spite of any improvement, sentiment remains heavily in favor of bears as it has for more than half a year. As shown below, the bull-bear spread has remained negative for 27 weeks in a row. That is the second-longest streak of negative readings on record but would need to continue for another two months to surpass the 2020 record.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/100622-AAII-3a.png))**

&gt; Not all of the losses to bearish sentiment went to bulls. Neutral sentiment also rebounded slightly rising from sub-20% (the lowest level since April 2020) to 21.3%.

&gt; # Buy Yom Kippur Lines Up with Almanac Aggregate Cycle

&gt; The market may not be down during the Sell Rosh Hashanah/Buy Yom Kippur period which ends today on Yom Kippur 2022. But it sure was a wild ride. Most importantly it lines up perfectly with our Almanac Aggregate Cycle. Back in mid-August this Aggregate Cycle called the end of the summer rally and now it’s pointing to a big move higher.

&gt; You can check the full stats Sell Rosh Hashanah, Buy Yom Kippur, Sell Passover in our September 23 post, but here’s a reminder of the awesome history of rallies from midterm year Yom Kippur to pre-election Passover. DJIA p 10 of 12, average gain 12.0%.

&gt; # Big Bounce in Claims...Or Is It?

&gt; Following a few months of downward trending initial jobless claims bringing the indicator back down around multi-decade lows, there has finally been a significant uptick. Whereas last week's reading was revised lower to an even more impressive 190K (the lowest since April), the latest print soared 29K to 219K. That is only the highest level since the end of August, but it also is back in the range of pre-pandemic readings while also marking the largest week over week increase in claims since the first week of June.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/100622-Claims-1.png))**

&gt; On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, claims rose as might have been expected for the current week of the year. As shown in the second chart below, as far as consistency of week-over-week increases go, the current week of the year is tied with the 2nd and 45th (approximately the weeks of January 8th and November 5th) for fourth as claims have risen 85.5% of the time since 1967. Additionally, before seasonal adjustment, it was not a particularly large increase as the 13.3K WoW rise was half of the average for the comparable week of the year. Even after that increase, unadjusted claims have only been lower during the year's comparable week twice: 1968 and 1969. In other words, a drift higher in claims is normal at this point of the year, and even with that move higher, claims remain nothing short of impressive.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/100622-Claims-2.png))**

&gt; As for continuing claims which are lagged an additional week to the initial claims number, the latest week saw a modest increase of 15K to 1.361 million. That snapped a streak of four consecutive weeks of declines. Whereas seasonally adjusted initial claims have risen back into the pre-pandemic range, continuing claims have only experienced a modest move higher and are well below their own levels from pre-pandemic years.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/100622-Claims-3.png))**

&gt; In the past few months, we have consistently checked in on the ratio of initial jobless claims to continuing claims (both seasonally adjusted) as a measure of the lack of follow-through of the former to the latter. With last week's very strong initial claims number that was more reflective of the still strong continuing claims number, that ratio has now come back in line with the historical average.

&gt; # Market Rebounds 28.2% After Midterm Year Down YTD Q3

&gt; S&amp;P 500 closed September down -24.8% year-to-date – the 4th worst YTD Q3 performance since 1930. Since WWII (1946) when S&amp;P 500 was down YTD at the end of Q3 in midterm year it gained 28.2% on average over the next 5 quarters with no losses.

&gt; In all 23 years the following Q4 was up 69.6 % of the time for an average gain of 3.1%. Subsequent Q1s were up only 52.2% of the time for an average gain of 2.7%. The following Q2s gained ground 65.2% of the time for an average gain of 2.9% and then next years were up 73.9% of the time for an average gain of 11.9%.

&gt; But the record for midterm years down at the end of Q3 is better. Of those nine midterm years highlighted in blue in the table only 1946 into 1947 had no bounce with 1947 closing exactly at the same price as 1946 for S&amp;P. Overall, Q4s were up 88.9% of the time, average gain 7.6%, Q1s up 77.8% of the time, average gain 6.7%, Q2 up 77.8% of the time, average gain 4.6% and next years up 88.9% of the time, average gain 19.2%.

&gt; So, while things look grim out there on Wall Street, economically and globally, odds are we are nearing a bottom and the prospects for Q4 and next year are encouraging, at least historically, seasonally and 4-year cycle-wise. But there is still a lot that needs to go right, and the market likely has further downside left.

97,TSM,FCF Yield of Stocks I am Watching,"I recently compiled a list of stocks with their free cash flow (FCF) yield to see how good or bad that investment might be compared to a **2 year treasury bond (which is currently yielding \~4.2%)**. The yield was calculated using the enterprise value (EV) of the company since a lot of the companies carry a high debt load (think about AT&amp;T, Verizon, and Comcast for example). 

**Here is the equation for FCF yield of a company/stock that I used: FCF(ttm)/EV and FCF(5 yrs avg)/EV.** So basically I looked at the trailing 12 months (ttm) free cash flows and last 5 years average free cash flows as well. The data was taken from Yahoo Finance app and approximate. If you like any of the stocks based on their FCF yield, definitely do additional research to verify /cross check the numbers (some of the data might be inaccurate because of human error ).

255,TSM,Apple Ditches iPhone Production Increase After Demand Falters,"Apple Inc. is backing off plans to increase production of its new iPhones this year after an anticipated surge in demand failed to materialize, according to people familiar with the matter.

The Cupertino, California-based electronics maker has told suppliers to pull back from efforts to increase assembly of the iPhone 14 product family by as many as 6 million units in the second half of this year, said the people, asking not to be named as the plans are not public. Instead, the company will aim to produce 90 million handsets for the period, roughly the same level as the prior year and in line with Apple’s original forecast this summer, the people said.

Demand for higher-priced iPhone 14 Pro models is stronger than for the entry-level versions, according to some of the people. In at least one case, an Apple supplier is shifting production capacity from lower-priced iPhones to premium models, they added.

Apple shares fell about 3% in pre-market trading in New York on Wednesday. US stock-index futures were also lower.

In Taipei, key chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. fell 2.2% and Apple’s biggest iPhone assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. was down 2.9%, amid a wide selloff of electronics suppliers. ASML Holding NV, maker of advanced chipmaking gear, dropped as much as 3.2% in Amsterdam.

Apple Suppliers Drop as Firm Said to Ditch IPhone Output Boost

Apple had upgraded its sales projections in the weeks leading up to the iPhone 14 release and some of its suppliers had started making preparations for a 7% boost in orders.

An Apple spokesperson declined to comment.

China, the world’s biggest smartphone market, is in an economic slump that’s hit its domestic mobile device makers and also affected the iPhone’s sales. Purchases of the iPhone 14 series over its first three days of availability in China were 11% down on its predecessor the previous year, according to a Jefferies note on Monday.

Ideally you get a paid some kind of yield, so maybe short SMH put and long OTM call and vice versa on TSM Short call long deep OTM put. I think I'd want to lean most into the OTM put as a proportion of the overall debit.

98,TSM,I think I have learned my lesson,"During high school. I invested in tech stocks such as NIO, TSM and AMD. I did this with no margin and ended up with 100% return through the covid years. This gave me confidence to be more bold with my investments. After graduating I decided to dedicate more time to learn about stocks. I still stuck with 0% margins and still followed my standard procedure when doing due diligence. I evaluated a company’s balance sheets, determined whether a company is undervalued or overvalued as I moved away from tech stocks and allowed myself to dip into other industries. I believe I had became pretty good at it. I invested in companies like AUPH at $11 and cashed out most of my stocks at ~$25. I bought into NET at $50 which Im still holding and still green on. However, recently BBBY soared up to the 20s. I read what the redditors over at WSB were saying and decided to throw in 15% of my equity into a position at X5 margins into BBBY. Today, the stock has dipped so much that I believe I am going to have to pay off my BBBY position with other positions in my portfolio. 

I think I have learned a valuable lesson today.

Edit: Never said I did due diligence on BBBY",2590,679,1660862666.0,2022-08-18T22:44:26+00:00,t3_wrx7zi,stocks

Aside from the positions I'm already in I'm looking at getting in TSM and RUN. For me if SPY breaks 415 we're looking good as a long term investment. If SPY breaks below 407 I might sell everything and rebuy at the whatever the new low is. For me, ENPH is a buy at 280, AMD is a buy at 100, MRVL I'm cautious about, LRCX is a buy at 500, NVDA at current levels seems to be a buy below 188, ASML is a buy at 575, AMAT is a buy at 105, TSLA is a fickle bitch but I'd buy at around 900.

41,TSM,Why I think China will declare war and invade Taiwan on August 8,"So you're probably wondering what's so special about August 8. To understand this, you will need a quick lesson on the significance of the number 8 in China.

The number 8 is considered a lucky number in Chinese culture and is associated with wealth. They also believe that more 8's are better. (Example: 888 &gt; 88 &gt; 8)

So then why does everything point to August 8? August 8, written as a date, is 8/8. What's more, is that the Chinese have used this date in the past for significant events.

205,TSM,Is Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan in her own interest?,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s trip to Taiwan ramps up U.S.-China tensions and risks pushing the countries further apart, according to one economist.

The top U.S. lawmaker met Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen on Wednesday in a highly controversial visit that has angered Beijing.

“We’re on a trajectory of escalating conflict and this will certainly make matters worse. It plays well to local politics in the United States and in Taiwan, but it does not play well to geostrategic forces that are pushing these two nations apart,” Stephen Roach, a Yale university senior fellow and former Federal Reserve economist, told CNBC’s “Street Signs Asia” on Wednesday.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s husband Paul just disclosed the purchase of more than $1 million of shares of AllianceBernstein Holding a global investment firm.

Paul Pelosi bought 15,000 AllianceBernstein (ticker: AB) shares on Feb. 18, and then purchased 25,000 more shares on Feb. 23, according to a form Speaker Pelosi filed on March 9. Each transaction was valued at between $500,000 and $1 million. Specific figures aren’t required for disclosure, only ranges.

256,TSM,Pelosi's visit to Taiwan effect: Geopolitical tensions rise. China shares slide," Mainland China and Hong Kong markets led losses in Asia on Tuesday as geopolitical tensions rose over U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan.

The Shanghai Composite lost 2.26% to 3,186.27 and the Shenzhen Component shed 2.37% 12,120.02. At session lows, both indexes were down more than 3%.

Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index fell 2.36% to 19,689.21, with heavyweights like Alibaba and Meituan falling 2.85% and 2.11% respectively. The Hang Seng Tech index slipped 3.01%.

Local media reports citing unnamed sources said Pelosi would go ahead with her visit to Taiwan, a democratic self-ruled island that China sees as a runaway province.

Regarding Pelosi’s trip, Beijing warned that its army would “never sit idly by” and will “uphold China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at a press conference on Monday.

“Pelosi’s visit will significantly raise US-China tensions but is unlikely to produce a Chinese reaction that risks conflict,” Eurasia Group analysts wrote in a Monday note.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s shares fell 2.38%, compared with a 1.56% loss to 14,747.23 on the wider Taiex index.

The dollar-yen may react to developments, said Saktiandi Supaat, regional head of FX research and strategy at Maybank.

“Geopolitical risk is always a factor that we look at in terms of, in the FX space. But it’s something hard to predict,” he told CNBC’s “Street Signs Asia” on Tuesday.

The Japanese yen, a safe-haven currency, traded at 130.93 per dollar, continuing its strengthening trend from last week.

66,TSM,Monday Afternoon Update 8/1:,"Good afternoon, everyone! Choppy flow day today. We are in a demand zone on the daily right now and SPY seems to want to stick very close to 411 price. Could be some consolidation for multiple days before we start to see the real move for the future so for now, I will be just playing some short scalps until we break out of this demand area.

Tomorrow Pelosi is set to land in Taiwan and set to speak to lawmakers on Wednesday amid rising tensions between US and China and Taiwan. If Pelosi doesn’t decide to go to Taiwan or backs out expect market to jump on news. If she does go expect higher volatility with uncertainty of what China will do as they have already said they would shoot down the plane.

My main concern with China and Taiwan is most of our semiconductors are based in Taiwan. TSM is one of the biggest chip manufacturers and they are strictly based there. If problems arise the states wouldn’t be able to or it would be very hard to get the chips strictly for the tech giants such as AAPL, TSLA, F, and many others.

Today the Atlanta Fed came out with their updated GDPNow Q3 estimate. It has now dropped since July 29th from 2.1% originally to now updated 1.3%. This is not good news for the future forecast as it has already dropped 0.8% and at this rate, we will be negative in a month.

These are the levels I will be watching for tomorrow 8/2:

&amp;#x200B;

SPY:

BULLISH: Above 411 – 413.36 (triple topped hod)

BEARISH: Below 411 – 408.41 (lod)

Support: 408.41, 407.18, 400

Resistance: 413.36, 416.69

206,TSM,Monday Afternoon Update 7/18:,"Good afternoon everyone! Crazy day today in the market and a lot to go over. Had a good gap up over the weekend after $TSM and tech semiconductor company beat earnings and boosted forecast for next quarter. 

Slow day to start off until the big news came out that shook the market. $AAPL plans to slow hiring and spending for some teams in 2023 and APPL being sued over apple pay, accused of antitrust violations.

This news seemed to really shake the markets as the tech giant is showing signs of the rising inflation and glooming recession on the company itself. Hit some support before close now waiting on the rest of the earnings reports to come out in AH. 

With that being said this morning we opened right at the top of the bull flag channel on the daily and the top of the bearish pennant on daily as well. Couldn’t gather up steam and melted down.

*****
&gt; Stock futures fell Thursday as traders assess the possibility of even tighter U.S. monetary policy on the back of a hot inflation report. Traders also pored over key quarterly results.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures shed 481 points, or 1.56%. S&amp;P 500 futures were 1.49% lower, and Nasdaq 100 futures lost 1.13%.
*****
&gt; Futures added to their losses after JPMorgan Chase reported quarterly earnings that missed analyst expectations. The stock fell more than 4% in premarket trading. Morgan Stanley is also set to report Thursday.
*****
&gt; The consumer price index rose 9.1% on the year in June, higher than a Dow Jones estimate for an 8.8% year-over-year increase. Core CPI, which excludes volatile prices of food and energy, was 5.9%, also ahead of a 5.7% estimate.
*****
&gt; In addition, the Beige Book, released Wednesday by the Fed showed worries of an upcoming recession amid high inflation.
*****
&gt; The CPI report also impacted treasuries, sending the 2-year Treasury yield up nine basis points to about 3.138% while the yield on the 10-year Treasury fell about 4 basis points to 2.919. An inversion of the two is a popular signal of a recession.
*****
&gt; The report also opened the door for a big Federal Reserve rate increase later this month, with the fed funds futures market now pricing in a hike of as much as 1% — or 100 basis points.
*****
&gt; “The takeaway for investors is that Fed policy remains data-dependent and the central bank will continue on an aggressive tightening path until inflationary pressures peak decisively,” strategists at BCA Research wrote in a note. “Persistent price pressures call for another jumbo hike at the July 26-27 FOMC, but there is still room for the data to improve before the September meeting, 8 weeks later.”
*****
&gt; Weekly jobless claims and the June producer price index report, which measures prices paid to producers of goods and services, will also be released Thursday. Both reports will give further insight into the economy.

It also announced it was temporarily suspending share buybacks.

*****
&gt; Stock futures fell Thursday as traders assess the possibility of even tighter U.S. monetary policy on the back of a hot inflation report. Traders also pored over key quarterly results.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures shed 481 points, or 1.56%. S&amp;P 500 futures were 1.49% lower, and Nasdaq 100 futures lost 1.13%.
*****
&gt; Futures added to their losses after JPMorgan Chase reported quarterly earnings that missed analyst expectations. The stock fell more than 4% in premarket trading. Morgan Stanley is also set to report Thursday.
*****
&gt; The consumer price index rose 9.1% on the year in June, higher than a Dow Jones estimate for an 8.8% year-over-year increase. Core CPI, which excludes volatile prices of food and energy, was 5.9%, also ahead of a 5.7% estimate.
*****
&gt; In addition, the Beige Book, released Wednesday by the Fed showed worries of an upcoming recession amid high inflation.
*****
&gt; The CPI report also impacted treasuries, sending the 2-year Treasury yield up nine basis points to about 3.138% while the yield on the 10-year Treasury fell about 4 basis points to 2.919. An inversion of the two is a popular signal of a recession.
*****
&gt; The report also opened the door for a big Federal Reserve rate increase later this month, with the fed funds futures market now pricing in a hike of as much as 1% — or 100 basis points.
*****
&gt; “The takeaway for investors is that Fed policy remains data-dependent and the central bank will continue on an aggressive tightening path until inflationary pressures peak decisively,” strategists at BCA Research wrote in a note. “Persistent price pressures call for another jumbo hike at the July 26-27 FOMC, but there is still room for the data to improve before the September meeting, 8 weeks later.”
*****
&gt; Weekly jobless claims and the June producer price index report, which measures prices paid to producers of goods and services, will also be released Thursday. Both reports will give further insight into the economy.

# [Stock futures tick higher with all eyes on June’s inflation report](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/12/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures rose slightly Wednesday as investors awaited a key inflation report that is expected to show a fresh high.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 82 points, or 0.26%. S&amp;P 500 futures climbed 0.31%, and Nasdaq 100 futures gained 0.41%.
*****
&gt; The consumer price index, slated for at 8:30 a.m. ET, is expected to climb by 8.8% in June on a year-over-year basis, according to Dow Jones’ survey of economists. That would be even higher than May’s 8.6% reading, which was the biggest increase since 1981.
*****
&gt; “The market is anticipating that June will be the new peak,” said Lindsey Bell, Ally’s chief markets and money strategist. “The reading is likely to confirm what the jobs report on Friday told us – that the Fed will stick to their aggressive rate tightening timeline.”
*****
&gt; The likely hot reading could prompt the central bank to hike another 75 basis points during this month’s meeting. Last month, the Fed raised its benchmark interest rates three-quarters of a percentage point to a range of 1.5%-1.75% in its most aggressive hike since 1994.
*****
&gt; “The Fed’s credibility will be tested in coming months with the release of inflation numbers and corporate earnings,” said Andy Sparks, head of portfolio management research at MSCI. “The Fed’s recent aggressive actions to bring down inflation also run the risk of overshooting, pushing an economy that had been showing signs of weakness into a full scale recession.”
*****
&gt; Meanwhile, investors will monitor second-quarter corporate earnings as major banks are set to report this week. JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley are slated to post results Thursday before the bell. Delta Air Lines reports before the bell Wednesday.

The airline earned an adjusted $1.44 per share for the second quarter, shy of the $1.73 consensus estimate. Revenue exceeded estimates on strong travel demand, but margins took a hit from higher fuel prices and higher operational costs.

# [Stock futures fall as growth concerns linger, dollar surges](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/11/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures fell Tuesday as worries over global economic growth dented investor appetite for risk assets. Wall Street also looked ahead to the start of what could be a difficult earnings season.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures slipped by 221 points, or 0.71%. S&amp;P 500 dipped 0.43% and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.07%.
*****
&gt; Investors appeared to be shunning riskier assets such as stocks in favor of traditional safe havens such as U.S. Treasurys and the dollar. The 10-year Treasury yield fell 7 basis points to 2.92%.
*****
&gt; The dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency’s performance against six other currencies, popped 0.5% to 108.51. That gain put the euro on the brink of parity with the dollar, as recession fears grow in Europe.
*****
&gt; The dollar index has been on fire this year, rising 13% in that time. Several Wall Street strategists have warned that this strength in the U.S. currency could spell trouble for corporate earnings ahead.
*****
&gt; “The surging USD is a symptom of global unease and will make life even more difficult for Corporate America (the EPS headwind from FX is going to be enormous) and int’l central banks (as the slumping EUR, GBP, etc., adds to the inflationary pressures in the EU and UK),” wrote Adam Crisafulli of Vital Knowledge.
*****
&gt; PepsiCo kicked off the corporate earnings season Tuesday morning, with the snacks and beverages giant reporting a better-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue. The company also raised its revenue outlook for the year. Delta Air Lines and JPMorgan Chase are among the companies slated to report later this week.
*****
&gt; Market participants will watch for downside risk to earnings forecasts as companies grapple with rising interest rates and greater inflationary pressures, and as Wall Street debates the likelihood of a recession.
*****
&gt; “In terms of S&amp;P earnings, for instance, we think we’re already moving towards an earnings recession,” Marathon Asset Management’s Bruce Richards said Monday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell.”
*****
&gt; “Companies are getting squeezed at all sides, they’re getting squeezed on cost of goods and the wages and all things that go into input from our manufacturing goals or services. And on the other end, we think revenues are starting to flatten before turning down at a time when interest cost is going up. ...That’s a lot of downgrades, a lot of potential defaults coming from the system as a result of higher charges.”
*****
&gt; Inflation is also on investors’ radars this week with June’s consumer price index report set for release Wednesday. The headline inflation number, including food and energy, is expected to rise to 8.8% from May’s level of 8.6%, according to estimates from Dow Jones.
*****
&gt; Wall Street was coming off a downbeat session in which the Dow, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq all fell.

### In the News

After the close Friday news broke that Elon Musk is trying to back out of his deal to buy Twitter (TWTR). This was not a huge surprise to the markets as TWTR was already trading -35%+ to its announced deal price. The stock was down an additional 5% after hours Friday. Tesla (TSLA) stock was higher last week, and was up after hours Friday on the news. The stock had not performed well since Musk’s TWTR takeover was announced and investors in TSLA seem happier without the distraction. Tesla stock was near $770 after hours on Friday, up from $680 the week before. From last week:

&gt;TSLA stock is trading near the same price of a year ago and is down about 45% from its all time highs above $1200. Options, which have underpriced moves in the stock (higher and lower) during its large swings of the past year are now pricing about a 15% move for the rest of July and about a 35% move by year end.

TSLA already made the move options were pricing for all of July before the calendar hit the 9th of July. It’s now pricing about an 11% move for the rest of the month.

The Musk / Twitter news may have been portrayed as a surprise over the weekend in the media, but clearly markets weren’t pricing a big chance of it happening. TWTR options were pricing a bullish consensus of about $46 in the stock out to December, well below the announced takeover price. The bearish consensus in December is about $25:

&gt; A cluster of inflation reports could affect markets, since they help set the tone for how aggressive the Federal Reserve will have to be in its battle to calm inflation.
*****
&gt; The June consumer price index looms large on Wednesday, and economists expect it could be hotter than May’s 8.6% year-over-year pace. It is also the report that could move markets most.
*****
&gt; “The headline is expected to be higher. That’s mostly because of energy,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. He added that core inflation, excluding food and energy, could be lower. West Texas Intermediate crude futures were as high as $122 per barrel in June, but have since fallen back in July and was just under $105 per barrel Friday.
*****
&gt; “The question is to what extent the moderation in goods prices is going to be offset by continued increasing services prices, predominantly driven by rent,” Boockvar said. “The government stats still have a lot of catch up room to the upside on rent.”
*****
&gt; There is also the June producer price index Thursday, and investors are closely watching Friday’s University of Michigan consumer sentiment report for July. That report contains consumer expectations about future inflation, an important metric watched by the Federal Reserve. June retail sales, another measure of the consumer, is also released Friday.
*****
&gt; “PPI is the seed for CPI...and it could have another 10% handle,” said Boockvar.
*****
&gt; The new inflation data comes on the heels of Friday’s strong employment report. In June, the economy added 372,000 jobs, about 120,000 more than expected. Strategists say the report reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise rates by another 75 basis points later this month. A basis point is one one-hundredth of a percentage point.
*****
&gt; “It was enough to continue on the path they’ve chosen. It’s not until you start to see rising unemployment on a monthly basis that I believe the Fed will start to buckle its knees,” said Boockvar.
*****
&gt; A key question for markets is when will inflation peak, as it has already continued to flare higher much longer than the Fed had initially anticipated.
*****
&gt; “I do think a risk to the markets is this fact that inflation may not have peaked,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. “I do still believe the markets are at least hopeful, if not expecting, that inflation will decelerate.”
*****
&gt; As investors watch the pace of inflation, the second quarter earnings season begins. Corporate profits could be the source of some market turbulence, if analysts are force to chop estimates for the balance of the year, as many expect.
*****
&gt; “The street has not really changed the estimates. Revenue growth has ticked down. Margins are compressing. Analysts are leaving their estimates unchanged,” said Boockvar. “If there’s going to be a readjustment, this is the time.”
*****
&gt; Second quarter earnings for the S&amp;P 500 are expected to grow by 5.7%, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. The third- and fourth quarter estimates have been moving down slightly, but are still 10.9% and 10.5%, respectively.
*****
&gt; “I think the market is bracing for a challenging earnings quarter, so how much it will result in volatility is unclear,” said Arone. He said companies will continue to beat but maybe by not as much. “I think they will lower their guidance. Why not? It just makes it easier to beat down the road. I do think earnings season will be a disappointment. It will be interesting to see how the market reacts.”
*****
&gt; Stocks in the past week were higher, with the S&amp;P 500 gaining 1.9% to 3,899. The Nasdaq rose 4.5% for the week.
*****
&gt; The worst performing major sectors for the week were utilities and energy. The S&amp;P consumer discretionary sector, which benefits from lower oil prices, bounced more than 4.5% on the week.
*****
&gt; The 10-year Treasury note was yielding about 3.07% Friday, but the 2-year note yield surpassed the 10-year this past week for the third time since late March. The result is a so-called inverted yield curve, which does sometimes signal recession. The 2-year yield was at 3.11% Friday afternoon.

&gt; # Get Ready for the Quadrennial Rally

&gt; Unfortunately, the stock market is delivering on its bearish historical 4-Year Cycle and seasonal tendencies here at the midway point of 2022. It is also playing out the less than sanguine outlook we wrote last year around this time in the 2022 Stock Trader’s Almanac (pages 10-11) and in our annual forecast from last December 16. So where do we go from here?

&gt; Much to our chagrin the short answer is that we have likely not seen the low either in price or time. Current trends are now leaning towards the “Worst Case” scenario we presented in our 2022 forecast which was for a “Mild bear market for S&amp;P 500 with 2022 ending down 10-20%.” With S&amp;P 500 down 20.6% year-to-date at the end of June the bear is fully in place.

&gt; As we have been guiding over the past several months, we still expect this bear to put in a typical midterm election year bottom sometime in the August-October timeframe just ahead of the midterm elections. Stocks are clearly exhibiting the historical weakness that often transpires in the Worst Six Months of the year May-October and they are also tracking the “Weak Spot” of the 4-year cycle. But this should set us up for the “Sweet Spot” of the cycle from Q4 midterm year through Q2 pre-election year.

&gt; The intersection of the annual seasonal pattern and the 4-Year Cycle produces the quadrennial “Sweet Spot.” As we continue to patiently ride out this bear the chart below of the 4-year cycle may provide some solace. We are currently finalizing the 2023 edition of the Stock Trader’s Almanac so here’s a sneak peek at this new chart from the 2023 STA that highlights the midterm low and most importantly the quadrennial rally from the midterm low to the pre-election year high in what we call the Sweet Spot of the 4-year cycle.

&gt; The second and third quarter of the midterm year has been the weakest period of the entire 4-year pattern averaging losses over the 2-quarter period of -1.2% for the Dow, -1.5% for the S&amp;P 500 and -5.0% for the NASDAQ Composite Index. But in the Sweet Spot of the cycle the Dow gains 19.3%, S&amp;P 500 increases 20.0% and NASDAQ jumps 29.3% over the three-quarter span from midterm year Q4 to pre-election year Q2.

&gt; It is for this reason that we call midterm election years “A Bottom Pickers Paradise.” From the midterm low to the pre-election year high DJIA gains 46.8% since 1914 and NASDAQ gains a whopping 68.2% since 1974! As the 2022 bear market runs its course, the market will likely bounce along sideways, testing the lows, hitting its low point in late Q3 or early Q4 in the August-October period in prototypical midterm bottom fashion. Then be prepared for the rally off that low into the Sweet Spot and beyond to new highs.

&gt; # Bulls Back Below 20%

&gt; Even though the second half of June and first week of July have seen the S&amp;P 500 climb back from its lows, sentiment appears to show that investors are not buying it. In today's update of AAII sentiment survey, there was an overall push toward more bearish tones. For starters, the percentage of respondents reporting as bullish fell back below 20%. Even though that is not any sort of new low, this week is the fifth in a row with less than a quarter of respondents reporting as bullish. As shown in the second chart below, such a streak has been unprecedented with the last example of such an extended streak of depressed sentiment being May of 1993.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/070722-AAII-1.png))**
&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/070722-AAII-1a.png))**

&gt; As bulls have been no where to be found, bears are plentiful with over half of respondents reporting bearish sentiment. This week's reading came in at 52.8%, up from 46.7% last week. Mirroring bullish sentiment, that is not any sort of new pinnacle for bearish sentiment as there were even higher readings that closed in on 60% last month. Regardless, sentiment remains historically pessimistic with few other periods having seen such elevated readings for as extended of periods.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/070722-AAII-2.png))**

&gt; With inverse moves in bulls and bears, there is now a 33.4 percentage point gap between the two readings which is in the 2nd percentile of all readings since the survey began in 1987.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/070722-AAII-3.png))**

&gt; That leaves neutral sentiment to be the only normal reading of the survey. At 27.8%, neutral sentiment is in the middle of its pandemic range and only 3.6 percentage points below its historical average.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/070722-AAII-4.png))**

&gt; The more bearish turn at the expense of bulls witnessed in this week's AAII survey was echoed by other readings on sentiment like the Investors Intelligence survey and NAAIM Exposure index. Combining all three of these sentiment readings into one composite, overall outlooks for the market took a further bearish turn this week with the average survey currently 1.8 standard deviations below its historical norm. That is slightly better than earlier this spring, but still, the only period since the mid-2000s with similarly pessimistic readings was in late 2008 and into 2009.

&gt; # Worst First Half Since 1970 Spin

&gt; As the market logged its worst first half start to the year since 1970 with DJIA down 15.3%, S&amp;P off 20.6% and NASDAQ down 29.5%, there has been a lot of positive spin on how great second halves are when the market is down so much in the first half. Well, we did some deeper digging and went back a bit further than some of the cherry-picked stats we have seen.

&gt; Unfortunately, as you can see in this chart of DJIA Top 10 Worst First Half Starts since 1901 all but two of the years, 1939 and 1970 end down 10% or more. Five years (1932, 1939, 1940, 1962 &amp; 1970) ended significantly higher (&gt;5%) than their mid-year levels. Three (1907, 1920, &amp; 2008) ended much lower and two (1910 &amp; 1913) were flat from mid-year to yearend.

&gt; # Worst Week of the Year For Claims

&gt; Initial jobless claims remain historically healthy in the low 200K range, but the most recent week's data did mark one of the highest readings of the year. Coming off of last week's unrevised 231K, claims rose 4K to the highest level since the second week of the year when they clocked in at 240K. That remains a much better reading than what was observed throughout much of the history of the data, but it is at the higher end of pre-pandemic readings (those from roughly 2017 through 2019).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/070722-Claims-1.png))**

&gt; As for the non-seasonally adjusted number, the current week of the year is essentially guaranteed to see a week-over-week increase. The current week has historically been the worst of the year in terms of week-over-week moves only having seen unadjusted claims fall once since 1967. That one decline was in 2020 when claims were working off unprecedented record highs. Given that historically consistent drift higher in claims during this point of the year, next week has historically averaged a temporary peak in claims. While that lends to the possibility of claims continuing to rise next week, the current reading is below that of comparable weeks of pre-pandemic years. In other words, claims are following standard seasonal patterns and are doing so at historically strong levels even if they have come off the absolute strongest levels of the pandemic.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/070722-Claims-2.png))**

&gt; Continuing claims have also begun to come off of the best levels of the pandemic. Adjusted continuing claims were expected to go unchanged at 1.328 million this week. Instead, they rose up to 1.375 million; the highest level since the week of April 22nd when claims were 12K higher.

103,TSM,Semiconductors in trouble?,"Disclosure: AVG Costs: TSM @ $97, INTC @ $40, AMD just entered @ $79; Looking to add ASML and AMAT if they drop another 8-10%.

All except INTC should reach 52-week low today, is this the beginning of the end of the cycle? 

I still have about 40% of fund to be deployed, planning to spend 10% per month until October. Today's a new month, so I'm looking for some feedback on the shopping list. I will try to spend the 10% each month and avoid holding onto cash. 

Should I continue to average down:

1. TSM ($97), INTC ($40), AMD ($79)
2. PARA ($25), WBD ($15) and DIS ($107)
3. SPY ($392), VWRA ($103)
4. XYLD ($44), QYLD ($18), RYLD ($21), JEPI ($55), JEPQ ($45)

- NVDA  
- AMD  
- TSM  
- MU  
- INTC

106,TSM,Better to buy a good company at a fair value or a fair company at a good value?,"I am confused by this statement. It’s a famous quote from Warren Buffet. What is a good company vs a fair company? 

Like I could see INTC and WBD as fair companies compared to “good” or top companies in their sector like DIS and TSM. INTC is loosing market share and WBD has more debt than their market cap.

But I also feel it could be argued that INTC and WBD are good companies at a good value. 

INTC is still the #1 chip maker and they have a plan to build fabs and catch up to TSM. The CEO seems excellent and they have huge potential once they improve their chips. Also great cash flow and solid div. 

WBD is a cash flow machine with many amazing entertainment assets. They will be able to pay of their debt over the longterm. The stock will easily double as their EPS grows and their debt reduces. 

Is a good company a company without problems? Buffet bought dumpster fire bank stocks in 2008. Were they good companies despite being on the edge of bankruptcy and collapse? Should the saying be good business model rather than good company? 

The way I see it, all these problem stocks have good business models that will allow them to overcome their problems. 

Anyone have an clarification for the expression in the title?",3,19,1655396233.0,2022-06-16T16:17:13+00:00,t3_vdpnw4,stocks

108,TSM,INFLATION SALE. POST YOUR WATCH LIST!,"I made one of these posts in [Q418](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/9wkq3x/the_dips_im_buying_this_week/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) and [March 2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/fl1qkg/covid19_spring_fire_sale_post_your_watchlist/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) and I think it's time I made another one. When it comes to my long-term portfolio I am a value investor and I believe another great buying opportunity is upon us. I can tell you 80% of the gains I've made in the last 5 years were from buying during the two aforementioned market corrections.  I encourage all the newer investors that have entered the market these last two years to look at this market correction as a great buying opportunity as well. [Finviz.com](https://Finviz.com) and [sec.gov/edgar](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html) should be your best friends when evaluating the fundamentals and financials of a company. Take the time to read some 10-Qs and learn about how P/E, P/S, FCF, debt/equity, ROA and the other financial metrics are used in evaluating the value of a company. Personally I still think the market has another 10% left to fall, but timing the bottom is something I'll leave to those much smarter than me, and I will focus on what I deem to be good value plays.

&amp;#x200B;

My list:

1. [**Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited**](https://www.tsmc.com/)  (TSM) under $80
2. [**Roblox Corporation**](https://corp.roblox.com/) (RBLX) under $30
3. [**Crocs, Inc.**](https://www.crocs.com/) (CROX) under $60
4. [**Alphabet Inc.**](https://www.abc.xyz/) (GOOG) under $2200
5. [**Intuit Inc.**](https://www.intuit.com/) (INTU) under $325
6. [**Shopify Inc.**](https://www.shopify.com/) (SHOP) under $400(earnings is this week, might change my number on results) edit: waiting to see if $300 hits now($30 post split)
7. [**Verizon Communications Inc.**](https://www.verizon.com/) (VZ) under $40
8. [**ZIM Integrated Shipping Services Ltd.**](https://www.zim.com/) (ZIM) under $50

This is my current watchlist some some of these might not reach my prices and that's fine, but if they do I will start accumulating. Honorable mentions are AMD, SE and PYPL which I have already caught the knife on :(

109,TSM,Criticisms of TSM,"I have been looking into TSM -- their gross margin, net margin, and other fundamentals -- and watched a few videos on their importance such as how they make up the 'silicon shield' of Taiwan. All of this puts them to be a good company. Even so, because all the things that I hear or read about them is positive and rarely any negative, I was wondering: What are some negatives of TSM? Where do they lack? And to those of you who know about TSM but have not bought: Why? -- What is your reason? Thank You.",36,34,1651508088.0,2022-05-02T16:14:48+00:00,t3_ugt7jt,stocks

110,TSM,Reddit ETF progress from Jan 2021 to Apr 2022,"So I just found [a Reddit ETF post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ku6skz/reddit_etf/) from the beginning of last year, near the period of peak euphoria.

111,TSM,Semiconductors stocks under pressure. Are good days are over?,"Hello,

I am long AMD, NVDA and QCOM and I am down. Semiconductors stocks are getting hit for the past few weeks due to downgrades and the increased risk of consumer demand decreasing. There is many  bearish articles and some CNBC contributors are betting against them. TSM dropped 3% even after good earning report and raising guidance, which is not good sign. I am worried that AMD and NVDA will get hit after their next ER.

Where do you see semiconductors stocks in the next 6 months?",14,22,1650561436.0,2022-04-21T17:17:16+00:00,t3_u8smmy,stocks
112,TSM,Tech Stocks Are Absurdly Cheap Now: putting my money where my mouth is,"Buckle in.

Investing isn't easy, and yet people are--and always will--try to act like it is. Just like every other period in stock market history, retail 'investors' are being lazy and emotional and valuing businesses based off the direction their prices are heading rather than long term fundamentals. Volatility is the price you pay for performance. Thinking it's time to sell tech and buy Kellogg, with corporate profits RISING, will get you into deep trouble. 

No, being a good investor has absolutely nothing to do with being 'contrarian'. It just so happens that retail is too lazy and emotional to notice that prices tend to head fake away from where people should be buying at any given timeframe. Sometimes these head fakes point to different asset classes, other times to different assets within any given class. 

Right now, it's both. 

People think tech is in 2001 territory strictly because of price action, when we are in literally the opposite place outside a handful of overvalued and overhyped names; and people think bond yields are becoming attractive, when bonds are in the worst bear market in years (though this could change at any time considering the overreaction we've seen in Fed rate predictions). **This is precisely when you should be buying reasonably priced tech with strong cash flows, pricing power, quality earnings growth, barriers to entry (either a difficult industry to break into or an outright moat, which is very rare and hard to predict but** ***Facebook has one*****), network effects, and demand inelasticity.** Your stocks don't have to have all of these elements, but the more, the merrier. 

**\*\*\***

**Here's some oversimplified but VERY true deductive reasoning that 99% of 'investors' fail to heed:**

\-Companies with higher earnings growth deserve higher valuations  
\-Companies with better pricing power deserve higher valuations  
\-Companies with higher quality earnings growth deserve higher valuations  
\-Netflix and Facebook are still growth companies, their earnings quality is only improving, and they have IMMENSE pricing power that they've only begun to tap into  
\-Proctor &amp; Gamble has a 40% higher relative valuation than Netflix  
\-CAMPBELL'S SOUP has a higher valuation than Facebook  
\-So-called 'investors' firmly believe that staples are the place to be right now, because 'interest rates' and 'inflation'. 

**Okay...**

\-Corporate profits drive stock prices--literally in lock step--over the long run  
\-Inflation is good for corporate profits  
\-Inflation requires higher interest rates  
\-Higher interest rates are a headwind for stocks  
\-Higher interest rates ARE A LITERAL CATASTROPHE FOR BONDS  
\-Holding cash *is basically taking a financial gun and pointing it at your face and pulling the trigger*  
\-The answer is to own quality assets, which are companies with strong cash flows, moats, network effects, etc.

**Millions of retail investors are absolutely convinced that tech is overvalued--but it's not because of poor fundamentals. Honestly, it's not even because of inflation, interested rates, or Ukraine. It's simply because prices are going down.** Do yourself a favor. Look at sentiment from one year ago today. Facebook to $600 was a done deal. Netflix was overpriced, and I wouldn't have bought it at near $700, but if anyone thought we would be below $230, we'd be minting new billionaires by the second because of their OTM puts. Amazon is more underpriced than I've maybe ever seen based off what we can easily see (the market has never understood Amazon, and AWS ALONE is clearly a multitrillion dollar valuation by 2030). 

**FACTS:**

\-**Amazon** PE is lowest ever while its future core businesses--AWS and ads (they are doing more ad revenue than YOUTUBE now, and AWS brings in more profit than any business line now, so if you think Amazon is a retail business you should be buying index funds...)--are growing at 40% or more.   
\-**Facebook** PE is lowest ever--last time this happened was three years ago, their stock price crashed to $131, and with this incredible overreaction they're STILL up 54% since then.   
\-And now to my favorite part: **Netflix** is at its lowest valuation since the 2000s and perhaps ever--who cares before then, it wasn't Netflix, it was a frickin' mail-order DVD company. Its PEG is .84. Its earnings have plateaued on SEVERAL occasions only to leap, over and over again. Just like Facebook, they were bound to hit a plateau for their core use base at some point. But if you think that means they're done growing out earnings--not to mention expanding other business lines, like Amazon did with AWS and ads, and Microsoft did with Azure--you need to ask yourself whether you have enough knowledge and experience here. 

In a way, investing really isn't that hard. **You just have to actually buy businesses and not obsess over the value of your portfolio every day**. If you do that, you're smart enough to see that tech could fall another 30% right now--and it would only present an even better buying opportunity with even more upside. As Buffett said after 2008, he might've been early, but he still got rich. And trust me, buying now might be early, but it will be INSANELY lucrative. 

SO SO SO many companies are just dirt cheap. People think DropBox is a shitty cloud business, when its top line is growing double digits and they're priced like Campbell's f'kn Soup. People think GoPro is a shitty camera business when it has begun adding software with INCREDIBLE margins and is growing rapidly again. Upstart is literally the only company in the market with the triple crown--triple digit growth, massively profitable, and BUYING BACK STOCK--yet its price was cut by 80%. There are just so many tech companies getting caught up in this indiscriminate selling, as if they're DoorDash or Rivian or Nikola or Snowflake, or any of the incredibly overpriced businesses, good or bad, that deserved to be cut in half.  

People calling this tech bubble 2.0 are either too young to understand what the tech bubble was, or too stupid to understand what it was. This is the literal opposite of the tech bubble. We have companies with tens of billions in FCF being repriced as if they're going out of business. Earnings are GROWING. We are in a BOOM cycle--IN TECH. You are being fooled--AGAIN. During the tech bubble, it's not that companies weren't making money...**THEY WEREN'T EVEN BRINGING IN REVENUE. DO YOU UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE?** Not even the most overvalued companies today (aside from Rivian and Nikola) can attest to such an atrocity. 

I pity the people who need to see instant green in their portfolios, and I hope to see your sea of !Remind Me! posts for five to ten years from now. **For those of you who take anything away from this post, here's putting my money where my mouth is:**

Here's my portfolio weighted by notional impact--i.e. ITM calls carry more leverage despite moving the same amount as 100 shares of a stock, or ATM short puts I've written to buy at a lower cost basis or just hold the premium. (**I plan on opening a Netflix position at some point soon.**)

**$UPST:** **16.9%** (Pretty much the perfect stock: AI lending company that's barely unaffected by rates and loan origination volume; already profitable by a mile; reinvesting capital into massive TAMs; and already has permission from the board to buy back stock. Hope you don't judge a stock by its PE because that's how you miss pretty much every single winner, from Amazon to Salesforce to Netflix.)  
**$CIM:** **7.7%** (Retracing like a tech stock right now with fortress balance sheet and 12% dividend yield--and climbing. Chimera did even better following the pandemic after cutting its dividend yield, which made for the perfect time to buy.)  
**$OSTK:** **7.54%** (Retail furniture business that's stealing market share from Wayfair and growing rapidly yet with a stock price selling as if it's going out of business--oh yeah, and they've got Medici Ventures, which is priced at zero.)  
**$Z: 6.56%** (Vertically integrated media business of which people seem to have zero understanding. It's literally in the best shape it's ever been: shed of its worst business segment and raising capital from home inventory; growing at over 20%; and selling at a 75%+ discount...yet people hate it infinitely more than when it was up near $200...LOL)  
**$AMZN: 5.97%** (Enough said above. This is a multitrillion dollar business that checks every box listed above selling at less than half its true value.)   
**$APPS:** **5.25%** (Growing triple digits, profitable, and with insane barriers to entry--not quite Upstart, but this is a 5x play.)  
**$URI:** **5.12%** (Picks and shovels play for infrastructure boom ahead. Someone will pass a version of build back better, and this company is a gem even without government subsidy. Also, United Rentals helps balance out my insanely tech-weighted portfolio just a tad bit, though that's not at all why I bought it--because I could care less how much money I lose in the short term to maximize long term gains.)  
**$FB:** **5.2%** (The greatest network company of all time--a company whose business model will never be repeated--is trading at a multiple 7% lower than the Campbell f'kin Soup Company. Enough said.)  
**$CLSK:** **4.71%** (One of the fastest growing companies in the world; already profitable; ESG sustainable Bitcoin miner; QUADRUPLE DIGIT GROWTH on the top line; trading at a SINGLE DIGIT forward PE--crashing as if both they and Bitcoin are going to zero.)  
**$STNE:** **4.37%** (A big boo-boo in their long book and concerns about the Brazilian economy are apparently enough to crash the stock over 90%. Like several other stocks on this list, earnings give a HUGE temporary boost because of how incredibly strong they are, only to watch the gains wither away because of indiscriminate selling in the tech space.)  
**$AMAT: 3.14%** (Picks and shovels play for the semiconductor bull market that will last for decades to come. Probably the only company on this list that I'd call fairly valued, but it's such a great company it's worth every penny.)  
**$PLTR: 3.09%** (It's apparently fun to hate Palantir because it was a meme stock. But if you can do math, 30% compound interest for 10 years does not a meme stock make. Probably the only stock on this list that I might even call *over*priced, but I also think it's worth every penny with a smaller position.)  
**$AMD: 2.97%** (Trading as if China is going to invade, tear down TSM, collapse the market for chips, and send interest rates to 50%. Beyond idiotically cheap.)  
**$MU: 2.85%** (Micron's pricing power is unmatched in this industry. Very few companies do what they do and none do it as well--and they're trading for pennies on the dollar.)  
**$DBX: 2.66%** (Apparently it's cool to hate Drew Houston? I don't know, but in addition to what was mentioned above, this company is set to buy back half it's MFing float. Like, are you kidding me?)  
**$NVDA: 2.61%** (Only reason I don't have a bigger allocation is because NVIDIA puts my total semi allocation at around 9%. I also owned Intel for a hot second before I rolled it into other plays. Think The whole space is going to continue to skyrocket, but no one has the creativity or talent that NVIDIA does.)  
**$BNTX: 2.6%** (The market thinks that this company stumbled upon vaccines, that covid is ending tomorrow, and that they have no other pipeline. The reality is that BioNTech is set to sell billions more in vaccines for a long time coming, and all of this is an incredibly massive tailwind to their rare diseases pipeline.)  
**$WBD: 2.22%** (It's always funny when some jackoff at BoA comes out with a report about how the merger between Discovery and Warner Brothers will create synergies that make this a $45 stock--6 months after the deal is announced. The stock rocketed above $30, then was indiscriminately sold off back to where it started--for no reason. The market is so efficient.)  
**$GPRO: 2.2%** (As mentioned above, this has become a software company with total control over its market and prices. 96% of action cameras in America are GoPros. The recurring revenue on that software makes this at least a $30 stock. But nobody wants to own it because RemEmBEr tHat TiME WheN iT SolD OfF?)  
**$NOK: 2.1%** (5G is them and some other guy. Enough said.)  
**$CRM: 1.81%** (This company does not stop growing. One of the best companies in the world and there is no end in sight. Personally think the Slack purchase is being totally swept under the rug. It's just that time of the cycle when you're supposed to doubt Benioff.)  
**$NLST: 1.33%** (Very unknown memory company with massive lawsuits against a bevy of huge companies and great prospects outside those lawsuits. They settled the lawsuit with SK Hynix and still have pending cases for patent infringement against the likes of Samsung, Micron, and Google--all of which are entirely legitimate.)  
**$AMRS: 0.8%** (A deep future play for molecules-as-a-function. This one is very nuanced and I'm getting tired of writing. You'd have to look into this one yourself to truly understand the importance of synthetic, sustainable molecules used in the place of limited and/or endangered organics at far cheaper prices across the cost spectrum.)  
**$SFT: 0.29%** (Kind of a random little lottery bet on a company with a market cap lower than its fourth quarter revenue alone. But with no path to profitability in sight, that's all it is: a lottery ticket with a VERY small amount of AUM allocated.) 

*It's not possible to create a perfect weighting with options in your portfolio, especially short puts, but I've done the best I can. For example, notionally, I could be tied to even more* ***Upstart*** *than I've represented here. But Upstart would have to be ITM across three separate strikes (70, 80, and 100) by January 2023, which nobody can predict. (What I can say is that anything under $100 is DIRT cheap for Upstart, so I'm more than happy to own it at about $51, $55, and $66, which would be the breakeven prices at each strike, respectively, when including the outrageous premium I was paid for writing these puts.) I split the notional values of being assigned each put in half to represent the fact that Upstart is currently ITM for my 100 puts, ATM for the 80, and OTM for 70. Arbitrary, but so is anything in this case, even if you'd use Black Scholes somehow.*",927,585,1650515580.0,2022-04-21T04:33:00+00:00,t3_u8fb6r,stocks

42,TSM,TSM Beats Earning…HIMX is next,"TSM is killing it.   They beat earnings and raised their forecasts.  For all the negative talk about semi-conductor demand possibly going down there seems to be statement after statement from the actual companies that demand has never been higher and they have pricing power.

“Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company raised an already bullish outlook as brisk demand for high-end processors helped the world’s largest contract chipmaker defy mounting macroeconomic risks posed by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and severe lockdowns in China.

Revenue from high-end processors, the complex chips that power servers, for the first time accounted for a larger chunk of TSMC’s revenue than smartphone chip sales. The shift marks growing demand from cloud service providers Google, Microsoft and Amazon and decreasing dependence on Apple.

The Taiwanese company on Thursday forecast a 37 per cent jump in revenue to US$18.2bn for the June quarter compared with the same period last year. It said it now believed revenue growth could exceed 30 per cent for the full year.

TSMC raised its forecast after beating its previous guidance and analysts’ expectations to post earnings of NT$202.7bn ($6.9bn) in the first quarter, up 45 per cent year on year.”

TSM has a PE of 25.

If TSM is doing that well, you know that the other big Taiwan semi-conductor company Himax will also destroy their earnings.  Thy only have a PE of 4!  How does that make sense to anyone?  The risk of China doing anything to Taiwan now is basically zero.  If HIMX matched TSM PE, the price would be $58 a share.  This Semi-Conductor business is the best deal out there.

&gt;
&gt;TAIPEI, April 14 (Reuters) - Taiwan's TSMC posted a better-than-expected surge in quarterly profit on Thursday and forecast an up to 37% jump in current-quarter sales, as a global chip crunch has kept order books full and allowed chipmakers to charge premium prices.
&gt;
&gt;TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker and a major Apple Inc supplier, reiterated on Thursday that it expected chip capacity to remain very tight this year, a shortage that has forced automakers and electronics manufacturers to cut production.
&gt;
&gt;Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) forecast revenue of $17.6 billion to $18.2 billion in the quarter ending June 30, up from $13.29 billion a year earlier.
&gt;
&gt;The company expects chip demand to continue in the long term and was working with customers to mitigate shortages, Chief Executive Officer C. C. Wei told an online earnings briefing, calling it a ""mega-trend"" in the industry supported by demand for 5G and artificial intelligence, as well as an increase in chips used in gadgets.
&gt;
&gt;TSMC is working to address supply chain challenges with tool suppliers, he added, referring to a cycle of shortages where makers of chip equipment are struggling to find the chips needed for equipment to supply chipmakers like TSMC.
&gt;
&gt;The company, which also has customers such as Qualcomm Inc , has previously said it expected strong growth to accelerate in coming years due to robust demand for chips that power everything from smartphones to cars. It has already lifted capital spending for this year.
&gt;
&gt;The company on Thursday said net profit for the January-March quarter jumped 45% from a year earlier to T$202.7 billion ($7 billion). Analysts expected a profit of T$184.67 billion, according to an average of 19 estimates compiled by Refinitiv.
&gt;
&gt;The first quarter was supported by better-than-expected demand from smartphone customers and high performance computing chips, as well as strong demand for auto related chips, Wei said.
&gt;
&gt;Revenue climbed 36% to $17.57 billion, beating market expectations, and above the company's own estimated range of $16.6 billion to $17.2 billion.

&gt; The war in Ukraine will remain a focus, as investors look for any signs of change in the crisis.
*****
&gt; Quincy Krosby, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial, said the first-quarter earnings reports from the financial sector will be important to a market considering the impact of the Federal Reserve’s plans to raise interest rates and aggressively tighten policy.
*****
&gt; “We want to get a picture of how do they see the Fed’s plan... quantitative tightening, the liquidity drain, coupled with higher rates, affecting their clients and their business units,” said Krosby. “If you look at the XLF [Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF], on days it goes up, it’s the insurance companies because they’re raising premiums. Higher rates are good for banks, until, the belief is, the higher rates are going to hurt the economy.”
*****
&gt; For the week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.3%, but the interest rate-sensitive Nasdaq Composite was down 3.9% and the S&amp;P 500 was off 1.3%. For a third week in a month, the jump in the 10-year Treasury yield topped 30 basis points, according to Wells Fargo’s Michael Schumacher. A basis point equals 0.01%.
*****
&gt; The 10-year rose above 2.7% on Friday.
*****
&gt; “It’s been on jet fuel,” said Schumacher. He said the 10-year yield, which moves opposite price, got a boost in the past week from the Fed’s signal that it is planning to trim its balance sheet by $95 billion a month, of which about $60 billion will be in Treasurys.
*****
&gt; The 10-year is important as a benchmark and also because it is a rate that affects mortgages and other loans.
*****
&gt; “People are saying the balance sheet is going to cause the 10s to move quite a bit,” said Schumacher. He said he could not rule out a move in the yield to 3%, given the speed at which the yield has moved recently.
*****
&gt; Economic data in the coming week could be a catalyst for another move higher.
*****
&gt; The four-day holiday week is packed with economic reports. Some will be released on the Good Friday market holiday. The highlight is Tuesday’s report of March’s consumer price index, which is expected to top the 7.9% reported for February.
*****
&gt; “It’s big. It’s the last key data point before the Fed meets May 3,” said Schumacher. A hot number, even in line with expectations, will encourage the market to expect a 50-basis-point hike, or a half percent, from the Fed at that meeting. The Fed began its rate hiking cycle in March with a quarter-point increase.
*****
&gt; The producer price index is set for release on Wednesday. Data on retail sales and consumer sentiment are due Thursday. On the Friday market holiday, Empire state manufacturing and industrial production are released.
*****
&gt; Barclays economists expect CPI rose 1.24% in March, gaining a stunning 8.5% year-over-year, the highest in 40 years. “We expect the annual rate of CPI to peak in March and move lower thereon, aided by positive base effects,” the economists wrote.
*****
&gt; The Fed’s preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures deflator is released April 29, but CPI and PPI will both set the tone for that report.
*****
&gt; “We’ve had such a sharp move in yields. Sentiment is so dour in rates, I wouldn’t be surprised if we got a relief rally in rates after we see the March CPI,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group.
*****
&gt; “While inflation pressures are still going to be here, I think March would be the peak inflation rate on a rate of change basis... You could get some rotation [in stocks] next week if you get a bond bounce,” said Boockvar.
*****
&gt; Schumacher said the bond market will also be watching the Bank of Canada for an expected rate hike when it meets Wednesday, and the European Central Bank for comments on its bond purchases at its Thursday meeting.
*****
&gt; # Earnings season
According to Refinitiv, S&amp;P 500 earnings are expected to be up 6.1% in the first quarter, but the financial sector is expected to see a decline of 22.9%.
*****
&gt; LPL’s Krosby expects to see choppy trading. “I think it’s going to be a difficult quarter,” she said. She said investors will be watching to see how the market absorbs a 50-basis-point hike. Quantitative tightening, balance sheet reductions known as QT, is also a policy tightening.
*****
&gt; “The QT could start next month. There’s a sense [the Fed] can’t wait any longer,” she said.
*****
&gt; Krosby said she recommends a defensive focus, favoring consumer staples, real estate investment trusts and health care, as well as consumer discretionary names that emphasize cost savings for consumers.

&gt; “I suspect at the end of next week, with the long weekend ahead, people will want to cut risk, but I suspect it could be a pretty rocky ride with CPI before we see that,” said Schumacher.

&gt; # Treasuries Yields Blow Past Dividend Yields

&gt; US Treasury yields have experienced a dramatic move higher as the market prices in continued rate hikes in the near future. With the increase in long-term Treasury yields, we're starting to see what looks like the end of a period where the S&amp;P 500 and the 10-year Treasury fought back and forth over which asset class had a more attractive yield.

&gt; As shown in the chart below, from 1970 right up to the period before the global financial crisis, the 10-year yield consistently yielded more than the S&amp;P 500. As the Fed cut rates to zero during the crisis, though, the S&amp;P 500 went on to see multiple periods where its dividend yield was in excess of the 10-year Treasury yield. With the recent surge in yields as the Fed embarks on what the market expects to be an aggressive rate hiking cycle, the script has been completely flipped. The 10-year now offers a roughly 125 bps higher yield than the S&amp;P 500 dividend yield which is the widest spread since the fall of 2018 and before that, the fall of 2011. As the spread between the S&amp;P 500 dividend yield and 10-year Treasury yield hits the low end of the GFC/post-GFC era, we would note that current levels are still roughly 200 bps higher than the historical average going back to 1970.

&gt; # Bulls Head for the Hills Once Again

&gt; After peaking at 32.8% two weeks ago, bullish sentiment continues to roll over as the S&amp;P 500 has erased some of the March gains this week. After this week's decline of 7.2 percentage points in bullish sentiment, less than a quarter of respondents reported as bullish. While low, that is still a few percentage points above the weaker levels from February.

&gt; ###### **([https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/04/040722-AAII-Bulls.png))**

&gt; Bearish sentiment in turn rose 13.9 percentage points which was the biggest one-week uptick since August 2019 when it rose 24.14 percentage points. At 41.4%, bearish sentiment is now at the highest level since the week of March 17th. That is an elevated reading and a big move week over week, but it is also well off recent highs from the past few months that were more than 10 percentage points higher.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/04/040722-AAII-Bears.png))**

&gt; The bull-bear spread tipped into positive territory for the first time in 2022 last week, but the big inverse moves between bulls and bears erased much of the past few weeks' move. The spread is down to -16.7 which is still 13.6 points above the late February low of -30.3.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/04/040722-AAII-BB-Spread.png))**

&gt; The big pickup in the number of respondents reporting as bearish didn't entirely come from the bullish camp. Neutral sentiment also shed a significant amount falling from 40.6% last week to 33.9%. That is essentially mean reversion as neutral sentiment now sits only a couple of points above the historical average.

&gt; # Near Record Low in Jobless Claims

&gt; This week's jobless claims release was significant in a couple of ways. For starters, the Department of Labor revised seasonal adjustment factors (more on that below) and second, the most recent print for the seasonally adjusted number hit one of the lowest levels on record. Claims came in at 166K which tied the number from two weeks ago (after revisions) for the second-lowest reading on record behind the week of 11/29/68. That week's reading was only 4K lower.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/04/040722-Initial-Jobless-Claims-SA.png))**

&gt; As for continuing claims, this week's reading was higher rising from 1.506 million to 1.523 million. Having come off last week's low, that remains one of the strongest levels since 1970.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/04/040722-Con-Jobless-Claims-SA.png))**

&gt; Pivoting back to initial claims, while adjusted claims are at multi-decade lows, non-seasonally adjusted claims are very healthy but not quite at a record. At current levels of 193.1K, the only year with a lower reading for the comparable week of the year was 1969 (170K) but at the seasonal lows in the few years prior to the pandemic, claims were even stronger than they are now. So while unadjusted claims are strong, the seasonally adjusted number was even more eyecatching this week.

&gt; As for why the seasonally adjusted number appears so much stronger, as shown in the second chart below, the current week of the year has historically been the second most consistent week of the year in seeing a week-over-week increase in claims. As a period with consistent seasonal headwinds, the seasonal adjustment would control for this by depressing the level of claims by a relatively strong seasonal factor. That usual increase was not seen this year as NSA claims were actually slightly lower falling from 196.8K to 193.1K. That means seasonal adjustment helped out what was already a strong number.

&gt; Additionally worth noting this week is the DOL changed its seasonal adjustment methodology. The DOL fully describes the change in this week's release and links to further reading on the topic for those interested in going deeper into the weeds, but to briefly summarize: periods when the level of an economic indicator experiences historic shifts in levels as claims did in 2020 and 2021, multiplicative adjustment (which has been used in ""normal times"" like prior to the pandemic and from here forward) would tend to over or understate adjusted claims. Additive adjustment, on the other hand, is less affected by the actual level of the indicator meaning it would lead to more accurate approximations of seasonally adjusted numbers in times of sudden spikes in the series. This methodology has been used throughout the pandemic period. Now that claims have more or less returned to a more normal range of readings, the DOL sees it justifiable to switch the seasonal adjustment methodology back to multiplicative. While that does not mean too much for interpreting claims, that change in methodology has led to some large downward revisions.

&gt; # 10 Things To Know About Inverted Yield Curves

&gt; One of the biggest stories over the past few weeks has been the inversion of various points on the U.S. Treasury yield curve. The more well-known 2-year/10-year yield curve spread inverted on April 1, 2022 for the first time since 2019, while the 5-year/30-year inverted for the first time since 2006 on March 28.

&gt; What is a yield curve? The yield curve plots the yield of different maturity bonds, usually Treasuries. In normal times, a longer dated bond should have a higher yield than a shorter dated bond. Historically, after key parts of the yield curve invert, the economy eventually has moved into a recession. This is why these signals are quiet important.

&gt; Here are ten things to know about the yield curve.

&gt; * Yes, past recessions have been proceeded by an inverted yield curve, but by no means does it happen right away. Another way to put it is yield curve inversions have preceded all recessions, but not all inverted yield curves lead to a recession. Historically, when the 2-year/10-year yield curve inverts, a recession has taken place an average about 19 months later.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Blog-4.5.22.png))**

&gt; * What about stocks? “One of the bigger surprises for investors is that stocks historically have actually done quite well after previous inversions,” explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “In fact, the S&amp;P 500 Index gained another 29% on average and peaked nearly 17 months later after the previous four inversions.” The bottom line is a yield curve inversion is a warning sign, but by no means does that mean trouble is coming immediately.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Blog-2-4.5.22.png))**

&gt; * In the LPL Research Chart of the Day (shown below), here is how the S&amp;P 500 has done after all the 2-year/10-year inversions going back to the mid-1960s. Once again, some of the more recent performance has been quite impressive.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/blog-3-4.5.22.png))**

&gt; * One thing investors seem to be ignoring lately though is the short-end of the curve. In fact, the Federal Reserve Bank (Fed) came out recently saying as much in Don’t Fear the Yield Curve. They concluded that the 2-year/10-year yield curve wasn’t a good indicator for recessions; instead the near-term spread between the 3-month/18-month forward yield curve has been much better. Take note that the 3-month/18-month forward yield curve has steepened significantly the past few months, reducing the chances of a recession. Speaking of the Fed, Chairman Powell said last month that the economy was on firm footing and would be able to withstand rate hikes. In other words, the Fed isn’t worried about a recession quite yet.

&gt; * Along these lines, the 3-month/10-year yield curve recently was at its steepest level in 5 years! This has been our personal favorite part of the yield curve to use as a signal for a pending recession (as the 2-year/10-year has given false signals before) and if and until this curve inverts, we believe the odds of a recession on the horizon is limited.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Blog-4-4.5.22.png))**

&gt; * Yield curves are one part of the bond market, but what the credit markets are saying is another (think of them as bond investors take on financial conditions) and we see a much different opinion here. Lately, high yield bonds have outperformed Treasuries ( Bloomberg US Corporate High Yield index and the Bloomberg US Treasury index), a clue the credit markets weren’t very worried about economic growth going forward. In the past, trouble starts brewing when high yield underperforms Treasuries.

&gt; * Adding to this, spreads on high yield and investment grade corporates have both come back significantly the past few weeks. “To see credit markets showing major signs of improvement the past few weeks is a great sign that financial conditions are probably better than most think,” explained Detrick. “Yes, the yield curve is flashing some warnings, but overall the credit markets are saying don’t get overly worried just yet.”

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/blog-5-4.5.22.png))**

&gt; * Real rates (rates adjusted for inflation) are negative. With the 10-year breakeven rate, what the bond market thinks inflation will average over the next 10 years, currently near 2.8% and the 10-year Treasury yield currently near 2.5%, real yields are actually negative. Historically, negative real rates have been quite bullish for risk assets. The Roaring 1920s, then during the 1940s and 1950s, were the last time we saw an extended period of negative real rates. As history told us, those decades saw explosive growth and stock market gains.

&gt; * Real yield curves (adjusted for inflation) are still upwardly sloping. Take note, we’ve seen real yields invert ahead of recessions in the past along with nominal yield curves (2006 and 2019 most recently), yet another clue a recession might not be as close as some fear. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs noted that nominal curves tend to invert more easily in high inflation environments (we can check this box now), suggesting it would take a deeper inversion than recent cycles to trigger a recession signal.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/blog-6-4.5.22.png))**

&gt; * Lastly, the Fed owns nearly $9 trillion in bonds and 25% of the entire Treasury market. Who knows where yields would be if they didn’t own any, but most agree longer-term yields would likely be much higher. So maybe various yield curves wouldn’t be inverted or even that close to inverting? This concept is mere conjecture, but it is a note we’ve seen lately that is at least worth pointing out.

&gt; There is a lot to digest here and this isn’t an easy subject, but the bottom line is the takeaway isn’t as simple as an inverted yield curve means a recession is imminent.

&gt; # April’s Stellar Track Record

&gt; April has been nearly perfect with gains steadily building from the first trading day to the last with only the occasional and minor blip along the way. DJIA has been up 16 Aprils in a row with an average gain of 2.9%. S&amp;P 500 has been up 15 of the last 16 Aprils with an average gain of 3.1%

&gt; April is last month of the Best Six Months November-April and when we begin tracking our Best Six Months Seasonal MACD Sell Signal. But before the “Worst Months” arrive, April’s solid historical track record could keep the current rally intact.

&gt; April got off to its usual stellar start the first two trading days of the month, but some surprisingly hawkish remarks from the usually dovish Federal Reserve Board Governor Lael Brainard has stocks on the ropes today.

&gt; Barring any major escalation in Ukraine, we suspect the market to log additional gains in April as the Best Six Months come to a close and then move sideways during much of Q2 and Q3. Likely testing the lows before rallying in Q4 and into 2023.

&gt; Our “Best Six Months” switching strategy found in our annual Stock Trader’s Almanac which is basically the flipside of the old “sell in May and Go Away” adage. After decades of historical research, we discovered that most market gains occur during the months November through April. Investing in the Dow Jones Industrial Average between November 1st and April 30th each year and then switching into fixed income for the other six months has produced reliable returns with reduced risk since 1950.

# **Big banks’ earnings and a hot inflation report could sway markets in short holiday week - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/08/big-banks-earnings-and-a-hot-inflation-report-could-sway-markets-in-short-holiday-week.html)**
*****
&gt; Markets face what could be a hot inflation report in the week ahead and a batch of big bank earnings to start the earnings season.
*****
&gt; JPMorgan Chase and BlackRock kick off the financial industry’s first-quarter earnings releases Wednesday, with Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs reporting Thursday.
*****
&gt; The war in Ukraine will remain a focus, as investors look for any signs of change in the crisis.
*****
&gt; Quincy Krosby, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial, said the first-quarter earnings reports from the financial sector will be important to a market considering the impact of the Federal Reserve’s plans to raise interest rates and aggressively tighten policy.
*****
&gt; “We want to get a picture of how do they see the Fed’s plan... quantitative tightening, the liquidity drain, coupled with higher rates, affecting their clients and their business units,” said Krosby. “If you look at the XLF [Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF], on days it goes up, it’s the insurance companies because they’re raising premiums. Higher rates are good for banks, until, the belief is, the higher rates are going to hurt the economy.”
*****
&gt; For the week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.3%, but the interest rate-sensitive Nasdaq Composite was down 3.9% and the S&amp;P 500 was off 1.3%. For a third week in a month, the jump in the 10-year Treasury yield topped 30 basis points, according to Wells Fargo’s Michael Schumacher. A basis point equals 0.01%.
*****
&gt; The 10-year rose above 2.7% on Friday.
*****
&gt; “It’s been on jet fuel,” said Schumacher. He said the 10-year yield, which moves opposite price, got a boost in the past week from the Fed’s signal that it is planning to trim its balance sheet by $95 billion a month, of which about $60 billion will be in Treasurys.
*****
&gt; The 10-year is important as a benchmark and also because it is a rate that affects mortgages and other loans.
*****
&gt; “People are saying the balance sheet is going to cause the 10s to move quite a bit,” said Schumacher. He said he could not rule out a move in the yield to 3%, given the speed at which the yield has moved recently.
*****
&gt; Economic data in the coming week could be a catalyst for another move higher.
*****
&gt; The four-day holiday week is packed with economic reports. Some will be released on the Good Friday market holiday. The highlight is Tuesday’s report of March’s consumer price index, which is expected to top the 7.9% reported for February.
*****
&gt; “It’s big. It’s the last key data point before the Fed meets May 3,” said Schumacher. A hot number, even in line with expectations, will encourage the market to expect a 50-basis-point hike, or a half percent, from the Fed at that meeting. The Fed began its rate hiking cycle in March with a quarter-point increase.
*****
&gt; The producer price index is set for release on Wednesday. Data on retail sales and consumer sentiment are due Thursday. On the Friday market holiday, Empire state manufacturing and industrial production are released.
*****
&gt; Barclays economists expect CPI rose 1.24% in March, gaining a stunning 8.5% year-over-year, the highest in 40 years. “We expect the annual rate of CPI to peak in March and move lower thereon, aided by positive base effects,” the economists wrote.
*****
&gt; The Fed’s preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures deflator is released April 29, but CPI and PPI will both set the tone for that report.
*****
&gt; “We’ve had such a sharp move in yields. Sentiment is so dour in rates, I wouldn’t be surprised if we got a relief rally in rates after we see the March CPI,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group.
*****
&gt; “While inflation pressures are still going to be here, I think March would be the peak inflation rate on a rate of change basis... You could get some rotation [in stocks] next week if you get a bond bounce,” said Boockvar.
*****
&gt; Schumacher said the bond market will also be watching the Bank of Canada for an expected rate hike when it meets Wednesday, and the European Central Bank for comments on its bond purchases at its Thursday meeting.
*****
&gt; # Earnings season
According to Refinitiv, S&amp;P 500 earnings are expected to be up 6.1% in the first quarter, but the financial sector is expected to see a decline of 22.9%.
*****
&gt; LPL’s Krosby expects to see choppy trading. “I think it’s going to be a difficult quarter,” she said. She said investors will be watching to see how the market absorbs a 50-basis-point hike. Quantitative tightening, balance sheet reductions known as QT, is also a policy tightening.
*****
&gt; “The QT could start next month. There’s a sense [the Fed] can’t wait any longer,” she said.
*****
&gt; Krosby said she recommends a defensive focus, favoring consumer staples, real estate investment trusts and health care, as well as consumer discretionary names that emphasize cost savings for consumers.

&gt; “I suspect at the end of next week, with the long weekend ahead, people will want to cut risk, but I suspect it could be a pretty rocky ride with CPI before we see that,” said Schumacher.

&gt; # Treasuries Yields Blow Past Dividend Yields

&gt; US Treasury yields have experienced a dramatic move higher as the market prices in continued rate hikes in the near future. With the increase in long-term Treasury yields, we're starting to see what looks like the end of a period where the S&amp;P 500 and the 10-year Treasury fought back and forth over which asset class had a more attractive yield.

&gt; As shown in the chart below, from 1970 right up to the period before the global financial crisis, the 10-year yield consistently yielded more than the S&amp;P 500. As the Fed cut rates to zero during the crisis, though, the S&amp;P 500 went on to see multiple periods where its dividend yield was in excess of the 10-year Treasury yield. With the recent surge in yields as the Fed embarks on what the market expects to be an aggressive rate hiking cycle, the script has been completely flipped. The 10-year now offers a roughly 125 bps higher yield than the S&amp;P 500 dividend yield which is the widest spread since the fall of 2018 and before that, the fall of 2011. As the spread between the S&amp;P 500 dividend yield and 10-year Treasury yield hits the low end of the GFC/post-GFC era, we would note that current levels are still roughly 200 bps higher than the historical average going back to 1970.

&gt; # Bulls Head for the Hills Once Again

&gt; After peaking at 32.8% two weeks ago, bullish sentiment continues to roll over as the S&amp;P 500 has erased some of the March gains this week. After this week's decline of 7.2 percentage points in bullish sentiment, less than a quarter of respondents reported as bullish. While low, that is still a few percentage points above the weaker levels from February.

&gt; ###### **([https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/04/040722-AAII-Bulls.png))**

&gt; Bearish sentiment in turn rose 13.9 percentage points which was the biggest one-week uptick since August 2019 when it rose 24.14 percentage points. At 41.4%, bearish sentiment is now at the highest level since the week of March 17th. That is an elevated reading and a big move week over week, but it is also well off recent highs from the past few months that were more than 10 percentage points higher.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/04/040722-AAII-Bears.png))**

&gt; The bull-bear spread tipped into positive territory for the first time in 2022 last week, but the big inverse moves between bulls and bears erased much of the past few weeks' move. The spread is down to -16.7 which is still 13.6 points above the late February low of -30.3.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/04/040722-AAII-BB-Spread.png))**

&gt; The big pickup in the number of respondents reporting as bearish didn't entirely come from the bullish camp. Neutral sentiment also shed a significant amount falling from 40.6% last week to 33.9%. That is essentially mean reversion as neutral sentiment now sits only a couple of points above the historical average.

&gt; # Near Record Low in Jobless Claims

&gt; This week's jobless claims release was significant in a couple of ways. For starters, the Department of Labor revised seasonal adjustment factors (more on that below) and second, the most recent print for the seasonally adjusted number hit one of the lowest levels on record. Claims came in at 166K which tied the number from two weeks ago (after revisions) for the second-lowest reading on record behind the week of 11/29/68. That week's reading was only 4K lower.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/04/040722-Initial-Jobless-Claims-SA.png))**

&gt; As for continuing claims, this week's reading was higher rising from 1.506 million to 1.523 million. Having come off last week's low, that remains one of the strongest levels since 1970.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/04/040722-Con-Jobless-Claims-SA.png))**

&gt; Pivoting back to initial claims, while adjusted claims are at multi-decade lows, non-seasonally adjusted claims are very healthy but not quite at a record. At current levels of 193.1K, the only year with a lower reading for the comparable week of the year was 1969 (170K) but at the seasonal lows in the few years prior to the pandemic, claims were even stronger than they are now. So while unadjusted claims are strong, the seasonally adjusted number was even more eyecatching this week.

&gt; As for why the seasonally adjusted number appears so much stronger, as shown in the second chart below, the current week of the year has historically been the second most consistent week of the year in seeing a week-over-week increase in claims. As a period with consistent seasonal headwinds, the seasonal adjustment would control for this by depressing the level of claims by a relatively strong seasonal factor. That usual increase was not seen this year as NSA claims were actually slightly lower falling from 196.8K to 193.1K. That means seasonal adjustment helped out what was already a strong number.

&gt; Additionally worth noting this week is the DOL changed its seasonal adjustment methodology. The DOL fully describes the change in this week's release and links to further reading on the topic for those interested in going deeper into the weeds, but to briefly summarize: periods when the level of an economic indicator experiences historic shifts in levels as claims did in 2020 and 2021, multiplicative adjustment (which has been used in ""normal times"" like prior to the pandemic and from here forward) would tend to over or understate adjusted claims. Additive adjustment, on the other hand, is less affected by the actual level of the indicator meaning it would lead to more accurate approximations of seasonally adjusted numbers in times of sudden spikes in the series. This methodology has been used throughout the pandemic period. Now that claims have more or less returned to a more normal range of readings, the DOL sees it justifiable to switch the seasonal adjustment methodology back to multiplicative. While that does not mean too much for interpreting claims, that change in methodology has led to some large downward revisions.

&gt; # 10 Things To Know About Inverted Yield Curves

&gt; One of the biggest stories over the past few weeks has been the inversion of various points on the U.S. Treasury yield curve. The more well-known 2-year/10-year yield curve spread inverted on April 1, 2022 for the first time since 2019, while the 5-year/30-year inverted for the first time since 2006 on March 28.

&gt; What is a yield curve? The yield curve plots the yield of different maturity bonds, usually Treasuries. In normal times, a longer dated bond should have a higher yield than a shorter dated bond. Historically, after key parts of the yield curve invert, the economy eventually has moved into a recession. This is why these signals are quiet important.

&gt; Here are ten things to know about the yield curve.

&gt; * Yes, past recessions have been proceeded by an inverted yield curve, but by no means does it happen right away. Another way to put it is yield curve inversions have preceded all recessions, but not all inverted yield curves lead to a recession. Historically, when the 2-year/10-year yield curve inverts, a recession has taken place an average about 19 months later.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Blog-4.5.22.png))**

&gt; * What about stocks? “One of the bigger surprises for investors is that stocks historically have actually done quite well after previous inversions,” explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “In fact, the S&amp;P 500 Index gained another 29% on average and peaked nearly 17 months later after the previous four inversions.” The bottom line is a yield curve inversion is a warning sign, but by no means does that mean trouble is coming immediately.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Blog-2-4.5.22.png))**

&gt; * In the LPL Research Chart of the Day (shown below), here is how the S&amp;P 500 has done after all the 2-year/10-year inversions going back to the mid-1960s. Once again, some of the more recent performance has been quite impressive.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/blog-3-4.5.22.png))**

&gt; * One thing investors seem to be ignoring lately though is the short-end of the curve. In fact, the Federal Reserve Bank (Fed) came out recently saying as much in Don’t Fear the Yield Curve. They concluded that the 2-year/10-year yield curve wasn’t a good indicator for recessions; instead the near-term spread between the 3-month/18-month forward yield curve has been much better. Take note that the 3-month/18-month forward yield curve has steepened significantly the past few months, reducing the chances of a recession. Speaking of the Fed, Chairman Powell said last month that the economy was on firm footing and would be able to withstand rate hikes. In other words, the Fed isn’t worried about a recession quite yet.

&gt; * Along these lines, the 3-month/10-year yield curve recently was at its steepest level in 5 years! This has been our personal favorite part of the yield curve to use as a signal for a pending recession (as the 2-year/10-year has given false signals before) and if and until this curve inverts, we believe the odds of a recession on the horizon is limited.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Blog-4-4.5.22.png))**

&gt; * Yield curves are one part of the bond market, but what the credit markets are saying is another (think of them as bond investors take on financial conditions) and we see a much different opinion here. Lately, high yield bonds have outperformed Treasuries ( Bloomberg US Corporate High Yield index and the Bloomberg US Treasury index), a clue the credit markets weren’t very worried about economic growth going forward. In the past, trouble starts brewing when high yield underperforms Treasuries.

&gt; * Adding to this, spreads on high yield and investment grade corporates have both come back significantly the past few weeks. “To see credit markets showing major signs of improvement the past few weeks is a great sign that financial conditions are probably better than most think,” explained Detrick. “Yes, the yield curve is flashing some warnings, but overall the credit markets are saying don’t get overly worried just yet.”

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/blog-5-4.5.22.png))**

&gt; * Real rates (rates adjusted for inflation) are negative. With the 10-year breakeven rate, what the bond market thinks inflation will average over the next 10 years, currently near 2.8% and the 10-year Treasury yield currently near 2.5%, real yields are actually negative. Historically, negative real rates have been quite bullish for risk assets. The Roaring 1920s, then during the 1940s and 1950s, were the last time we saw an extended period of negative real rates. As history told us, those decades saw explosive growth and stock market gains.

&gt; * Real yield curves (adjusted for inflation) are still upwardly sloping. Take note, we’ve seen real yields invert ahead of recessions in the past along with nominal yield curves (2006 and 2019 most recently), yet another clue a recession might not be as close as some fear. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs noted that nominal curves tend to invert more easily in high inflation environments (we can check this box now), suggesting it would take a deeper inversion than recent cycles to trigger a recession signal.

&gt; * Lastly, the Fed owns nearly $9 trillion in bonds and 25% of the entire Treasury market. Who knows where yields would be if they didn’t own any, but most agree longer-term yields would likely be much higher. So maybe various yield curves wouldn’t be inverted or even that close to inverting? This concept is mere conjecture, but it is a note we’ve seen lately that is at least worth pointing out.

&gt; There is a lot to digest here and this isn’t an easy subject, but the bottom line is the takeaway isn’t as simple as an inverted yield curve means a recession is imminent.

&gt; # April’s Stellar Track Record

&gt; April has been nearly perfect with gains steadily building from the first trading day to the last with only the occasional and minor blip along the way. DJIA has been up 16 Aprils in a row with an average gain of 2.9%. S&amp;P 500 has been up 15 of the last 16 Aprils with an average gain of 3.1%

&gt; April is last month of the Best Six Months November-April and when we begin tracking our Best Six Months Seasonal MACD Sell Signal. But before the “Worst Months” arrive, April’s solid historical track record could keep the current rally intact.

&gt; April got off to its usual stellar start the first two trading days of the month, but some surprisingly hawkish remarks from the usually dovish Federal Reserve Board Governor Lael Brainard has stocks on the ropes today.

&gt; Barring any major escalation in Ukraine, we suspect the market to log additional gains in April as the Best Six Months come to a close and then move sideways during much of Q2 and Q3. Likely testing the lows before rallying in Q4 and into 2023.

&gt; Our “Best Six Months” switching strategy found in our annual Stock Trader’s Almanac which is basically the flipside of the old “sell in May and Go Away” adage. After decades of historical research, we discovered that most market gains occur during the months November through April. Investing in the Dow Jones Industrial Average between November 1st and April 30th each year and then switching into fixed income for the other six months has produced reliable returns with reduced risk since 1950.

What are you all watching for in this upcoming holiday-shortened trading week?

257,TSM,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, March 28, 2022","**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, March 28, 2022**

Stocks reversed early losses to close higher on Monday to build on two straight weeks of gains as investors continue to digest developments coming out of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and a busy week chock full of new economic data. The price of crude oil, which spiked to $130 directly after Russia’s invasion,  fell more than 9% to $103 per barrel.

On Friday, the US and allies levied new sanctions against Russia in response to its unwarranted invasion of Ukraine. The new sanctions target hundreds of members of the Russian parliament and the CEO of the largest bank in the country. Most significantly, the US Department of the Treasury warned that any gold-related transactions involving Russia may be sanctionable by US authorities. 

A senior administrator at the Treasury said, “Our purpose here is to methodically remove the benefits and privileges Russia once enjoyed as a participant in the international economic order.” As a reminder, Russia has already been expelled from the SWIFT international payment system, which essentially freezes banks from sending or receiving transactions. The move comes as President Joe Biden and NATO allies convene in Brussels for a series of summits to discuss the conflict.

In the US, the Federal Reserve has the inevitable task of reigning in the fastest pace of inflation in over forty years without tanking the economy and plunging us into a recession. To that end, last week, the Federal Reserve raised the interest by 0.25% from near-zero levels for the first time since 2018 and committed to shrinking the balance sheet.

He said the Fed was ready to “take necessary steps to ensure a return to price stability. In particular, if we conclude that it is appropriate to move more aggressively by raising the federal funds rate by more than 25 basis points at a meeting or meetings, we will do so. And if we determine that we need to tighten beyond common measures of neutral and into a more restrictive stance, we will do that as well.”

Later this week, the Bureau of Labor Statistics is set to release the March job report, which will give a clearer picture of the state of the labor market in the US. Labor market tightness is a strong influence on the Fed's decision to begin tightening monetary policy, with historically low levels of unemployment coupled with a record number of job openings suggesting the economy is strong enough to absorb these hikes. The report is likely to show another robust reading with payrolls expected to rise by 490,000, according to Bloomberg economist estimates.

Christopher Rupkey, Chief Economist at FWDBONDS, said “The payroll jobs report could be the biggest one yet in this recovery from the pandemic. “Federal Reserve officials are already chomping at the bit for bigger 50 bps rate hikes at upcoming meetings, and the tightest labor market since the 1960s is like pouring gasoline on the fire were any policy official worth his or her salt is burning with desire to get interest rates up to 2% neutral levels now. 

In other economic news,  is a fresh read on the monthly personal consumption expenditures (PCE) deflator due out Thursday. The gauge is another indicator of how quickly prices are increasing across the country. Consensus economists expect the PCE to post a rise of another 0.6% in February, according to Bloomberg data. Core PCE, which is the measure the Fed uses to conduct monetary policy, is also expected to show a 0.3% month-over-month increase to 5.5%. 

**Highlights**

116,TSM,I need some help on when to cut losses,"So first I will give you some info on my situation: 

I started investing 1,5 years ago and like many others I made a few mistakes and jumped on a few hyped stocks (including BABA, NIO and TSM).

* BABA: -46,5% (-1.150€)
* NIO: -53,4% (-662€)
* TSM: -9,3% (-100€)
* 1810: -46% (148€)

 I also am down with a few ETF I bought:

* RIZF: -8% (-424€) Sustainable Food ETF
* XMLH: -12,2% (-1.170€) Healthcare ETF
* ESPO: -3,3% (-380€) Van Eck Video Games
* IS3N: -2,8% (-470€) MSCI EM

I definitely don't want to invest in the above mentioned stocks in the long run. I just thought that I could wait it out and sell as soon as I woukd be in the black figures again. But right now I am not that sure about it anymore.

With the XMLH and ESPO i feel more confident investing long term and would also like to keep them even if the XMLH looks pretty bad atm. I am pretty sure I want to get rid of the Rize ETF and for the case of IS3N I am completely indecisive. Originally I wanted the emerging market having a much higher share in my portfolio but right now I think I don't feel very comfortable with that. 

So like I mentioned in the question above I just don't know how to make the decision on when to cut losses. There might be a time when the stocks are not that much down but I feel waiting to long might also be wrong, especially because I could invest the money also in a better stock/ETF.",15,25,1648210162.0,2022-03-25T12:09:22+00:00,t3_tnkifn,stocks

the only thing i can think of is people are concerned that China will invade Taiwan.

120,TSM,Semiconductors in the next 6-12 months,"Just wondering what people's thoughts are on semis this year. When I look at P/E - and I understand this is a very simple comparison, but still a useful metric - there's definitely some variance. I also understand that companies play to different markets, but this is more of a general semi question/debate.

P/E and Next 5-year growth rate

* NVidia:  62.83     30.2%
* AMD:     47.03     29.9%
* TSM:      27.13     20.3%
* QCOM:  19.59     14.7%  (maybe this doesn't belong in this group?)
* INTC:     9.82        3.4%

So, where does the value lie on this group? More importantly, who in the group is likely to be punished this year during rate hikes? I hold AMD still, but sold NVidia near the end of last year (took some profit to balance some losses). TSM looks like a great  pick... if only it wasn't a risk d/t China (edited for stupidity, and too risky for me).

Who's holding/buying/selling what, and why?

Edit: My apologies for leaving out Intel - it's the morning after my wife's birthday and my brain is a little scrambled.... I knew I was forgetting something but... well... sorry.",24,76,1645899304.0,2022-02-26T18:15:04+00:00,t3_t23cyk,stocks
43,TSM,China Invasion Risk Sees Taiwan’s TSMC Moving Fabs Overseas,"At first glance, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp’s plan to build foundries in Japan and the US looks like just another routine business expansion.

But dig deeper and it quickly becomes clear that these are not just more run-of-the-mill deals.

As tensions between Taiwan and China mount, TSMC’s pivotal role in the global semiconductor supply chain has emerged as one of the gravest risks to the world economy.

It’s hard to understate TSMC’s importance to the world. It accounts for more than half of global foundry revenue while in the manufacturing of advanced chips under 10 nanometers it controls about 84% of the global market, according to the European Institute for Asian Studies in Brussels.

Those chips are at the heart of every leading-edge device and weapon on the planet and they are central to the battle for tech supremacy between the US and China.

121,TSM,Anyone else think the dip on semiconductors will be a once in a decade opportunity to build wealth?,"Two major catalysts playing out for semis right now:

* Fed raising rates.
* Russia sanctions and possible invasion [cutting off key semiconductor materials](https://www.reuters.com/technology/white-house-tells-chip-industry-brace-russian-supply-disruptions-2022-02-11/).

In the next few months, these will play out and really pummel the semi stocks. But the good news is these are temporary events. After 1-2 years, we'll find a way around Russian chokehold on these key materials, and inflation will probably be slowed. While that's happening, covid is still subsiding and innovation continue it's relentless march of driving productivity forward.

To be clear, **I'm not saying to buy the dip right now.** But I'm tempted to start a ""eat ramen"", ""get a third job"", ""cancel Netflix"" regime for myself to start preparing as much as possible to start buying mid or later this year.

These semi stocks are becoming the new FANGS, and this upcoming dip this year might be the best chance to buy them before they rocket into FANG status.

OK here's the cons in my theory:

* China could still be a ticking time bomb. Most experts say their lockdown strategy is not viable for Omicron. Could be their supply chain is a lot more broken than we realize. Plus that real estate problem is still ongoing and their president is kinda insane.

* The Fed could freak out and raise rates too quickly, putting us into a recession.

* Some industry reports say oversupply of semiconductors could happen as early as 2023.

*These posts are for informational purposes only. I am not a financial advisor.*

**Main Watchlist:**

Gapping UP:

* KSS: Potential premarket support at \~59. Figures to see some resistance up at this level, will be watching for more upwards movement if it can hold up over 60. We'll see what things look like closer to open, could provide shorting opportunities if it breaks down below the 58 level. 
* UL: Potential premarket support at 52.50, with another support level at 52. Will be watching for more upwards movement if it can hold above those levels, figures to see some choppiness if it breaks down. 
* TSM: Appears to have failed over relevant resistance at 128 in Friday's trading. Will be watching price action around the 124.50-125 level closely, looking for shorting opportunities if it breaks down.
* UVXY: Will be looking to trade this if we continue to see weakness in the overall market, SPY in particular.

Gapping DOWN:

* COIN: Premarket resistance at 177.50. Will look for shorting opportunities if the crypto market continues to see weakness. 
* TSLA: Potential support level at 900, with other relevant support level in the 885-890 range. Could continue to retrace back towards more significant support levels if the weakness continues. 
* NIO: Will be watching \~25.50 as a potential support level. Will watch for shorting opportunities on a breakdown, could see a bounce off support though.
* MRNA: Potential support level right around 140, with another significant support level at 120. I'll be watching for a potential bounce this morning (resistance at 160), but will watch for shorting opportunities as the day progresses. 
* BA: Potential support at \~200, will watch for a retrace towards 190 support. Will look to short the break below 199. 
* UAL: Premarket resistance at 41, potential support level at 40. 
* RCL: Potential support level at 77, will look for shorting opportunities towards 76 support on a breakdown. 
* BABA: Potential resistance level at 120, will watch for shorting opportunities if it fails to get back above that level.  
* AMD: Potential premarket resistance levels at 115 and 117. Will be looking for shorting opportunities. 
* SQ: Potential support level around \~110. Could retrace towards 100 support if it breaks down.
* SNAP: Premarket resistance at 31, could provide shorting opportunities if it fails to get back above that level. 
* DWAC: Potential support level at 67, will be watching for weakness if it breaks down. 

**Momentum Watchlist:**

* EXTN: Premarket high at 4.97. Won't be too interested in trading it if it drops down below the \~4.30 level. 
* MBOT: Will be watching possible resistance level at 7. Will also want to see volume increase a bit.

**Market Outlook:**

Stocks are looking to open lower to start the new week. We have a busy week of earnings ahead of us, and things could get interesting. Expectations for tighter financial policy from the Fed have triggered this sell-off we have been seeing, and in my opinion, the outlook isn't looking great for the next few months. We are already in correction territory; as of Friday close, the S&amp;P had dropped over 8% off its ATH, with the Nasdaq down over 14% off its ATH levels. With interest rates set to rise as soon as March, I think we could see high valuations continue to come down. Is this the catalyst that was needed for a crash? Maybe, we'll see. But with other potential negative catalysts looming (inflation, COVID, war), I'm still bearish. 

S&amp;P Futures are down a bit over 1%, Dow Futures are down \~60 basis points, and Nasdaq Futures are down \~1.5%. Gold is trading slightly higher this morning, while silver is down a bit. Gold has been doing well over the past month, I'll be watching for the strength to continue. Crude oil is seeing some weakness this morning, but still trading well over $80 per barrel. Could retrace to that support level if it sees more weakness. Tech stocks are seeing continued pressure, and I'll be looking for more of that today. Chinese stocks are down in premarket trading as well. Airlines and cruise stocks are seeing weakness as well. 

The crypto market saw some considerable weakness over the weekend, and I think it's safe to say the crypto crash is well under way. Bitcoin is currently trading around 33,400, now more than 50% off its ATH. Ethereum is trading around 2,200, and has also dropped over 50% off ATH levels. I'm not buying back in until we find some solid support, although I may look at some LEAPs for crypto-related stocks. Crypto-related stocks are getting hammered in premarket trading as a result. 

Remember to use proper risk management; size appropriately for your account and have a plan for every trade you enter. Happy trading everyone :)",31,7,1643033426.0,2022-01-24T14:10:26+00:00,t3_sbn2bq,StockMarket
124,TSM,Semiconductor Supercycle: Are we peaking or just starting? Crash coming?,"The general consensus is that semiconductor shortage will continue throughout 2022. However, there's some disagreement over what's going to happen in 2023. Here's the bear case:

* [IDC report](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/idc-report-semiconductor-market-growth-2021-overcapacity-2023) predicts overcapacity by 2023.

* [Phelix Lee of Morningstar](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2022-01-04/chip-shortage-may-turn-into-glut-in-2024-morningstar-video) sees demand from PC and Phones to plateau in next 5 years, and new demand from augmented reality and EVs will not be large enough to justify all this new foundry capacity. 

If there's a clear ""bull case"" explaining why we're only at the beginning of a supercycle, I would love to read it. Some questions for discussion:

* Do you agree there will be oversupply in 2023? What is the basis of your reasoning?

* How does your answer to previous question affect your strategy on chip stocks like Intel, AMD, NVDA, TSM, Marvell, GFS, Samsung, Qualcomm, Teradyne, etc? (I own shares or options on these stocks)

* Why would companies like Intel expand capacity that will come online when we reach oversupply? Are they geniuses or bad planners?",8,31,1642991380.0,2022-01-24T02:29:40+00:00,t3_sbaxss,stocks
44,TSM,Value Buying and War Profiteering with this Intel INTC bull(shit)ish DD,"Let's start of with the basics and normie shit.

Intel has been getting curbstomped by Semi-conductor industry darlings AMD and NVidia. Apple has moved away from Intel with their new M1 cpus and INTC looks poised for rough times ahead.

But, the market may be overreacting as Intel's stock price is suffering so badly that it's P/E ratio is sitting at a mere 9.09 despite the Semi-conductor industry's average P/E of over 30, making it potentially severely undervalued. Especially since Intel remains an industry giant and has also recently stepped foot into the GPU industry. [More excitingly](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-stock-looks-undervalued-poised-142150105.html), intel is planning on taking Mobileye, a market leader in driving assistance and self-driving cars (comparable and competitive with Tesla), public, with Intel intending to retain a majority stake. So perhaps the future is not so dark.

[Grabbing Pat Gelsinger at the beginning of 2021](https://apnews.com/article/pat-gelsinger-bob-swan-1e72be04fdc13cb86ae3a05784fdf2c3) was also a great move as he is one of the best CEOs America has to offer, fit to lead Intel into a new age.

**So far so boring. Okay so INTC may be a value buy. whatever, value is for shitters.**

**WELL HERE COMES THE SHITPOST DD. IF YOU GET OFFENDED BY SOME OF THE POTENTIALLY POLITICAL SHIT IN THE FOLLOWING SHIT DD YOU DON'T HAVE THE GRINDSET, THE POLITICS ARE TANGENTIAL, THE GAINS ARE OUR GOAL.**

A fact that many investors fail to consider is that INTC is actually an industry rarity. AMD, Nvidia, Qualcomm and Apple are all ***FAB-less***, meaning they outsource their production to semi-conductor Foundry giants, with the majority utilizing **TSMC** (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing). Intel on the other hand fabricates their own chips, and are in fact **investing $20 billion** on explanding their production by constructing [new chip factories in Arizona](https://www.itpro.co.uk/hardware/components/361015/intel-begins-construction-of-two-new-chip-factories-in-arizona).

So what?

**Think South China Sea, Supply Chain issues, America vs China trade-war Import taxes and the China - Taiwan One China Fiasco.**

We've already seen the amount of damage supply chains can do to industries, and the Semi-conductor industry is no different. With the majority of tech companies previously mentioned not having in-house Foundries to fabricate semi-conductors, should any damage/issues arise for **TSMC** the **BIGGEST FOUNDRY** in the world, massive costs will be incurred on everyone of these companies.

**Imagine for a second that the American Chinese cold war (that we all know is happening) escalates into a conflict in the South China Sea.** Supply Chains from TSMC will be completely severred or atleast severely impacted, meaning that a targetted supply chain issue will begin to occur in the world, negatively impacting ONLY **FAB-LESS** semi-conductor companies. An issue that Intel does not suffer from.

**Now imagine for a second, another scenario in which China does take over Taiwan.** (Yes, shit idea I know.) It is HIGHLY likely that America will impose heavy trade bans/import taxes on China as a way of economic retaliation (We've seen this already, and other shit like the death of Huawei's overseas presence). Importing from **TSMC** becomes unprofitable or nigh-on impossible. China may also limit exports from key companies as a way of retaliation as well. Overall, the situation because much more difficult for **Foundry-less** companies. AND as a side-effect, Intel becomes an American Industry Patriotic Figurehead and receives Government funding, turning around its downtrend and **SKYROCKETING** to market leader territory, perhaps even becoming an international **Foundry** Giant, filling in the void left by TSMC's departure.

NASDAQ:INTC TO THE FUCKING MOON (Riding on the back of a cruise missile)

**TL;DR**

**INTC** is potentially undervalued, but that's not the point. The point is that China and America are going to war, and it's going to shatter the Taiwanese Semi-conductor supply chain that Fab-less Semiconductor companies rely on. INTC has local and American foundries, therefore it will not be affected, allowing it to boom should conflict arise. War profiteering has never been easier.

(Please don't be offended at the THOUGHT that China might take over Taiwan, this is a THEORY and I DON'T SUPPORT IT, BUT IT MIGHT HAPPEN.)",25,17,1642744324.0,2022-01-21T05:52:04+00:00,t3_s93p1f,wallstreetbets
214,TSM,Sentiment Analysis on Stock Comments,"Hey everyone. I made code to automate some sentiment analysis on a big thread about different stocks. Essentially it gives ratings on stocks based on people's opinions in the comments.

215,TSM,[D] Sentiment Analysis on wallstreetbets,"Hey everyone,

I made code to automate some sentiment analysis on last weekend’s main thread. Essentially it gives ratings on stocks based on people's opinions in the comments.


Using 21k comments, I filtered based on if they contained a stock ticker listed on any of the NYSE, Nasdaq, or TSX and if they appeared in more than 2 comments. Here are the results. The 'compound' is the score, with 1 meaning really positive feelings and -1 meaning really negative feelings. Also, don't be a dick, I realize there are bugs and this is just a very early version I've made. Ideas on any other stats you'd like to see are very welcome

216,TSM,"Morning Update for Friday, 1/14/22","Good morning everyone. Have a nice Friday, and enjoy the long weekend :)

*These posts are for informational purposes only. I am not a financial advisor.*

**Main Watchlist:**

Gapping UP:

* LVS: Premarket resistance at \~42.50. Will want to see it find support above 41, could provide shorting opportunities if it breaks down. Will be watching for upwards movement if it holds up.
* WYNN: Potential support levels at 91 and 90. Relevant resistance at \~95. 
* MGM: Potential support level at 46, will be watching to see if it holds up or breaks down. 
* WFC: Potential support level at 56.75. Will watch for more upwards movement if it holds up, could provide shorting opportunities if it breaks down.
* UVXY: Will be looking to trade this if we see continued weakness from the overall market, I like watching SPY for reference. 

Gapping DOWN:

* NVAX: Potential support/resistance level right around \~100, will be watching for potential ORB setup. 
* MRNA: Potential support/resistance level at \~200. Will be looking for shorting opportunities if we break down and cannot recover. If it reclaims the 200 level, there is room for upside. 
* TSLA: Will be watching for shorting opportunities down towards potential support level at 1,000. Could see a retrace towards 950 support if it sees continued weakness. 
* JPM: Potential resistance level at 164. Will be watching for shorting opportunities if it fails to get back above that level. 
* NET: Looking bearish after breaking down below 100 support in yesterday's trading. Potential support at 96, will watch for shorting opportunities if it breaks down. 
* TSM: Potential support level at 135, will be watching for shorting opportunities if it breaks down. 
* ZM: Potential support level at 160, will watch for shorting opportunities if it breaks down. 
* SRC: Potential resistance level at 48. Will be watching for more weakness if it breaks down. 

**Momentum Watchlist:**

* MLCO: Potential premarket support around \~10.40. Won't be too interested in trading it if it breaks down and cannot recover. 

Not much looking great for the momentum list at the moment, could be worth running the scanner a few more times before market open. 

**Market Outlook:**

Stocks are looking to open lower after we saw some selling off in yesterday's session. The Federal Reserve has indicated that they could raise interest rates ""as soon as asset purchases are terminated"". The Fed is currently on track to end the tapering process in March, so the market seems to be pricing in the likely rate hike. With inflation continuing to run rampant, financial policy will continue to be a hot topic of discussion in the coming months. Omicron concerns seem to be taking a backseat to financial policy and inflation at the moment. I think it's worth noting that the omicron strain is notably less severe; if we get a more severe mutation, it could cause real problems for global markets. 

S&amp;P Futures are down \~60 basis points, Dow Futures are down \~60 basis points, and Nasdaq Futures are down \~80 basis points. Gold is trading flat this morning, while silver is down a bit. Crude oil is also trading a bit lower, but still holding above the $80 level. Banks are mixed after reporting earnings. WFC is trading slightly higher after positive results, while JPM and C are gapping down after expressing concern over rising labor costs. Semiconductor stocks are down in premarket trading after selling off on Thursday. We saw weakness from tech stocks in yesterday's session; I'll be looking for more of the same today, although we could see a bounce. Vaccine-related stocks are seeing weakness in premarket, should see heavy volume in today's session. Airlines and cruise stocks are down a bit after seeing decent strength yesterday. Most are still hovering around resistance levels. The crypto market is down a bit after seeing some more red yesterday. Bitcoin is currently trading around 42,300. We'll see if it can find support above the 40,000 level, but could be in for some more choppiness. Crypto-related stocks are down in premarket trading as a result.

Remember to use proper risk management; size appropriately for your account and have a plan for every trade you enter. Happy trading everyone :)",7,21,1642170071.0,2022-01-14T14:21:11+00:00,t3_s3thjn,StockMarket
125,TSM,Thoughts on Semi-ETF SMH moving forward ?,"TSM absolutely crushed earnings and was able to withstand the sell off today. Will this performance spill over to the other chip makers as they report earnings?

On a 6 month basis -- SMH is up 16% vs 4% QQQ.

I just wonder if the market is going to punish these semi stocks in fears of higher interest rates? Despite the fact we need semi's for basically everything.

The market is going bananas with F b/c of EV production, so I would imagine that translate to semi,",7,9,1642114709.0,2022-01-13T22:58:29+00:00,t3_s3c826,stocks

**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, January 13, 2022**

Volatility resumed in the markets after a brief two-day rally, as market participants digested new weekly unemployment data and the monthly CPI and PPI reports, which showed the fastest pace of inflation in decades. 

**Markets Today**

* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): -1.38%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): -2.50%
* Dow Jones (DIA): -0.48%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): -0.92%
* Volatility Index (VIX): +15.27%
* Tesla (TSLA): -6.75%
* NVIDIA (NVDA): -5.27%

* Shopify (SHOP): -8.93%
* Taiwan Semiconductors (TSM): +5.31%
* Cloudflare (NET): -13.35%
* Alibaba (BABA): -4.92%

The Labor Department’s weekly unemployment report showed an unexpected rise in first-time filings, with new unemployment claims rising to 230,000 from 207,000 last week. Still, new filings remain near pre-pandemic levels. Continuing jobless claims improved to their lowest level since 1973. Here are the numbers:

* **Initial jobless claims:** 230,000 vs. 200,000 expected and an unrevised 207,000 during prior week
* **Continuing claims:** 1.559 million vs. 1.733 million expected and a revised 1.753 million during prior week

Meanwhile, the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ December producer price index (PPI) showed a 9.7% year-over-year increase in prices paid by producers, the biggest jump since 2010. Core PPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, came in at 8.3%.

Omar Aguilar, Chief Investment Officer at Charles Schwab Asset Management, said “The inflation picture obviously is something that people are trying to understand — the concept of PPI and the fact that we're getting ... numbers that we haven't seen in quite some time. The labor market seems to continue to be very tight and very strong, and I think investors are trying to understand what the implications might be for the reaction of the central bank.”

[https://www.bls.gov/news.release/ppi.nr0.htm](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/ppi.nr0.htm)

The PPI comes the day after the Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed that prices for consumer goods rose 7.0% year-over-year, the fastest pace of inflation since 1982. CPI matched consensus estimates and showed a minor acceleration compared to November 6.8% print.

By category, prices for used cars and trucks and shelter were the largest contributors to the headline increase. The used cars and trucks index rose for a third straight month and accelerated to a 3.5% month-on-month rise in December from November's 2.5% increase. This index was also higher by a marked 37.3% compared to the same month last year. Shelter prices rose 0.4%.  

The core measure of consumer price changes, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 5.5% in December over last year, representing the fastest increase since 1991. This accelerated from a 4.9% annual gain in November.

* Microsoft is investing $50 million in a LanzaJet facility in Georgia that will produce jet fuel from ethanol next year, LanzaJet said. LanzaJet, based in Chicago, said it has nearly completed on-site engineering at its Freedom Pines Fuels Biorefinery, with plans to start producing 10 million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel per year from sustainable ethanol by 2023.
* General Motors (GM) said a trio of chips from Qualcomm Inc will power the ""Ultra Cruise"" driver-assistance feature on a luxury Cadillac sedan next year.
* Microsoft Corp hired a key Apple Inc engineer Mike Filippo, who worked in the development of Apple’s in-house chip, to design its own in-house server chips, according to a report by Bloomberg.

That's the highest rate in four decades. With inflation continuing to run rampant, the Fed's recent hawkish stance looks more and more likely to become a reality sooner rather than later. It's a sticky situation with COVID though; things could get messy. Banks are expected to report Q4 results on Friday, which will kick off this earnings season.

127,TSM,(1/13) Thursday's Pre-Market Stock Movers &amp; News,"#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to Thursday! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Thursday, January 13th, 2022-

*****

# [Stock futures nudge higher after a 3-day winning streak for Nasdaq](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/12/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures were slightly positive during early trading on Thursday after the Nasdaq Composite rose for the third session despite a red-hot consumer price index report.
*****
&gt; Dow futures were up 56 points. S&amp;P 500 futures rose about 0.1%, and Nasdaq 100 futures gained roughly 0.1%.
*****
&gt; In early earnings action, Delta Air Lines posted a beat on profit and revenue and reaffirmed full-year guidance. Shares rose about 1.7% in premarket trading. Elsewhere, shares of homebuilder KB Home rallied more than 8% in extended trading after reporting better-than-expected earnings.
*****
&gt; Analysts expect fourth-quarter earnings to be up 22.4%, according to Refinitiv, but guidance for 2022 from companies will likely be a key determinant for market action.
*****
&gt; Elsewhere, Dow component Boeing rose about 3% premarket following a Bloomberg News report that the company’s 737 Max could resume service in China as soon as this month.
*****
&gt; On Wednesday, the major averages rose despite the consumer price index showing the highest year-over-year increase since June 1982, it was largely in line with Wall Street expectations. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 38 points and the S&amp;P 500 added 0.3%. The Nasdaq Composite gained for the third straight day, climbing 0.2%.
*****
&gt; The December consumer price index, a key inflation measure, increased 7%, according to the department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics.
*****
&gt; “Stocks shook off the sticker shock of the historically high inflation number, but that was also widely expected and incredibly a non-event today really,” said Ryan Detrick of LPL Financial. “What we are excited about is earnings season is right around the corner. We expect another solid showing by corporate America, while it will also be a chance to stop focusing so much on the Fed and policy, but instead get under the hood and see how the economy is really doing.”
*****
&gt; The December producer price index, another measure of inflation, is then set to come out on Thursday morning. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones are looking for a 0.4% monthly increase on the headline number and a 0.5% gain after stripping out food and energy prices.
*****
&gt; Also on the data front, initial jobless claims for the week ending Jan. 8 will be released at 8:30 a.m. Economists polled by Dow Jones forecast 200,000 people filed for unemployment, down from the previous week’s 207,000.
*****
&gt; Markets also will be watching action on Capitol Hill, where Fed Governor Lael Brainard will be heading for her confirmation as vice chairman of the central bank’s policymaking Federal Open Market Committee.
*****
&gt; Fourth-quarter earnings season kicks off this week with several major banks reporting on Friday before the bell.
*****
&gt; “The stock market is of course still vulnerable near-term to a bad PPI inflation report, but earnings season is about to begin and given how strong economic growth was in the fourth quarter, expect more evidence of ongoing solid company earnings to help soothe contemporary Fed tightening and inflation fears,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist for the Leuthold Group.
*****
&gt; For the week, the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq are up 1.1% and 1.7%, respectively. The Dow is up slightly since Monday.

# [Stock futures nudge higher after a 3-day winning streak for Nasdaq](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/12/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures were slightly positive during early trading on Thursday after the Nasdaq Composite rose for the third session despite a red-hot consumer price index report.
*****
&gt; Dow futures were up 56 points. S&amp;P 500 futures rose about 0.1%, and Nasdaq 100 futures gained roughly 0.1%.
*****
&gt; In early earnings action, Delta Air Lines posted a beat on profit and revenue and reaffirmed full-year guidance. Shares rose about 1.7% in premarket trading. Elsewhere, shares of homebuilder KB Home rallied more than 8% in extended trading after reporting better-than-expected earnings.
*****
&gt; Analysts expect fourth-quarter earnings to be up 22.4%, according to Refinitiv, but guidance for 2022 from companies will likely be a key determinant for market action.
*****
&gt; Elsewhere, Dow component Boeing rose about 3% premarket following a Bloomberg News report that the company’s 737 Max could resume service in China as soon as this month.
*****
&gt; On Wednesday, the major averages rose despite the consumer price index showing the highest year-over-year increase since June 1982, it was largely in line with Wall Street expectations. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 38 points and the S&amp;P 500 added 0.3%. The Nasdaq Composite gained for the third straight day, climbing 0.2%.
*****
&gt; The December consumer price index, a key inflation measure, increased 7%, according to the department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics.
*****
&gt; “Stocks shook off the sticker shock of the historically high inflation number, but that was also widely expected and incredibly a non-event today really,” said Ryan Detrick of LPL Financial. “What we are excited about is earnings season is right around the corner. We expect another solid showing by corporate America, while it will also be a chance to stop focusing so much on the Fed and policy, but instead get under the hood and see how the economy is really doing.”
*****
&gt; The December producer price index, another measure of inflation, is then set to come out on Thursday morning. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones are looking for a 0.4% monthly increase on the headline number and a 0.5% gain after stripping out food and energy prices.
*****
&gt; Also on the data front, initial jobless claims for the week ending Jan. 8 will be released at 8:30 a.m. Economists polled by Dow Jones forecast 200,000 people filed for unemployment, down from the previous week’s 207,000.
*****
&gt; Markets also will be watching action on Capitol Hill, where Fed Governor Lael Brainard will be heading for her confirmation as vice chairman of the central bank’s policymaking Federal Open Market Committee.
*****
&gt; Fourth-quarter earnings season kicks off this week with several major banks reporting on Friday before the bell.
*****
&gt; “The stock market is of course still vulnerable near-term to a bad PPI inflation report, but earnings season is about to begin and given how strong economic growth was in the fourth quarter, expect more evidence of ongoing solid company earnings to help soothe contemporary Fed tightening and inflation fears,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist for the Leuthold Group.
*****
&gt; For the week, the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq are up 1.1% and 1.7%, respectively. The Dow is up slightly since Monday.

**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, January 12, 2022**

Stocks rose on Wednesday despite a new report on inflation coming out this morning, which showed the fastest rate of increase in consumer prices since 1982. The inflation report comes the day after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell testified before Congress and said the Central Bank was ready to step in to stop inflation. 

**Markets Today**

Wednesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics December Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed that prices for consumer goods rose 7.0% year-over-year, the fastest pace of inflation since 1982. CPI matched consensus estimates and showed a minor acceleration compared to November 6.8% print.

By category, prices for used cars and trucks and shelter were the largest contributors to the headline increase. The used cars and trucks index rose for a third straight month and accelerated to a 3.5% month-on-month rise in December from November's 2.5% increase. This index was also higher by a marked 37.3% compared to the same month last year. Shelter prices rose 0.4%.  

The core measure of consumer price changes, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 5.5% in December over last year, representing the fastest increase since 1991. This accelerated from a 4.9% annual gain in November.

[https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm)

Ian Shepherdson, Chief Economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said “December’s increase to 7.0% ... likely is not quite the peak which we think will be about 7.2% in January and February, but the run of big increases is over, and it will start to fall in March. By September, we look for 4-1/2%."" If we do not see inflation begin to moderate in the next two, three months, expect the Fed to step in to more aggressively raise the interest rate.

On Tuesday, Powell gave his confirmation hearing before Congress, in which he said the US economy was healthy enough to support a reduction in the accommodative monetary policy that has propped up the markets for the last two years. This means putting an end to quantitative easing and raising the interest rate.

He said, “As we move through this year … if things develop as expected, we’ll be normalizing policy, meaning we’re going to end our asset purchases in March, meaning we’ll be raising rates over the course of the year. At some point perhaps later this year we will start to allow the balance sheet to run off, and that’s just the road to normalizing policy.”

Powell reiterated that the Central Bank was prepared to act if the pace of inflation does not begin to moderate in the coming months. He said, “If we see inflation persisting at high levels, longer than expected, if we have to raise interest rates more over time, then we will.”

The Fed’s most potent tool remains interest rates, which the central bank has pinned to zero since the depths of the pandemic. Raising interest rates could address higher demand by making it more expensive to borrow. However, higher borrowing costs would not do much to address supply-side constraints and shipping bottlenecks that are greatly contributing to the rise in prices. Powell said, “We can affect the demand side, we can’t affect the supply side. But this really is a combination of the two.”

Brian Belski, Chief Investment Strategist at BMO Capital Markets said, “I think the biggest comment on most investors' minds that we talk to around the world would be a 'policy mistake' that the Fed might be too aggressive. Mr. Powell basically came out today and said this is going to be a process ... with respect to how long this is going to take, and I think that's what's calming investors.""

*These posts are for informational purposes only. I am not a financial advisor.*

**Main Watchlist:**

Gapping UP:

* DELL: Looking to test ATH levels. Potential support level at 59, will watch for more upside if it holds up.
* TSM: Potential resistance level at 126, could provide shorting opportunities if it fails to break over that level. Will watch for upwards movement if it can hold up over 126. Potential support level around \~124. 
* VIAC: Will be watching 36 as potential support level. Potential resistance level around 38. 
* BUD: Potential resistance level at 64. 
* BMRN: Potential support level at 88, will watch for upwards movement towards 90 resistance if it holds up. Could provide shorting opportunities towards 86 support if it fails to hold over 88. 
* UVXY: Potential support levels at 13.25 and 13. Will look to play this if we see more overall weakness, particularly for SPY.

Gapping DOWN:

* LULU: Potential resistance levels at 336 and 340. Will be watching for more weakness if it fails to get over those levels. 
* TSLA: Will be watching the 1,000 level as potential support/resistance this morning.
* TTWO: Potential support/resistance level at 150. Could retrace towards 145 if it fails, room for upside if it can get back over resistance. 
* ABNB: I'll be watching for shorting opportunities if it breaks down below 160 support. 
* NET: Potential support level at 100.

**Momentum Watchlist:**

* RVPH: Appears to have found premarket support at \~3.25. Will watch for more upside if it can hold up. Won't be too interested if it breaks down and cannot recover. 
* DNAY: Will be watching to see if it can get back above the 10.50 level. Won't be too interested in trading it otherwise.
* OCGN: Potential support level at 4.20, potential resistance around 4.50. 
* TLRY: Potential resistance levels at 7, 7.25, and 7.50.

**Market Outlook:**

Stocks are looking to open lower to start the week after we saw some selling off towards the end of last week. We could be in for some more choppiness, as omicron cases saw another surge. Treasury yields also continued to rise, with the 10-year seeing its biggest weekly move since late 2019. We'll see what things look like closer to open, but it could be another day for shorting. 

S&amp;P Futures are down \~60 basis points, Dow Futures are down \~30 basis points, and Nasdaq Futures are down a bit over 1%. Gold and silver are trading slightly lower. Crude oil is down a bit as well, now trading back below the $80 resistance level. Banks are showing continued strength, with several banks pushing through to fresh ATH levels. This could continue given the uncertainty surrounding Fed financial policy at the moment, as an interest rate hike is likely on the horizon. Chinese stocks are mixed in premarket trading after closing last week with relative strength compared to the rest of the market. Airlines and cruise stocks have seen decent strength over the past couple weeks, but are still trading below previous support levels. If they reject those levels over the next few days, they could be in for more weakness. Meme stocks had some pretty intense intraday sell-offs on Friday, still worth keeping an eye on them to start the week though. The crypto market is seeing continued weakness after a relatively uneventful weekend. Bitcoin is currently trading around 40,800. I'll be watching around the 40,000-40,500 level as potential support, but I'm expecting more choppiness. Crypto-related stocks are down in premarket trading as a result.

**Last Week –** SPY finished last lower by about 1.9% (or about $9). That was more than the 1% move options were pricing.

**This Week –** SPY options are pricing a 1.3% move (about $6 in either direction) for the upcoming week. With the SPY around $466 that is a range of about $460 to $472.

**Implied Volatility** – The VIX ended Friday just under 19, higher on the week. Expected moves for this week are near historical averages.

**Expected Moves for This Week** (Via Options AI)

* SPY **1.3%** (about $6)
* QQQ **2.1%** (about $8)
* IWM **2.3%** (about $5)
* DIA **1.3%** (about $5)

&amp;#x200B;

### In the News

Last week I highlighted the range options were pricing in Tesla into its first trading day after new vehicle numbers:

*“TSLA stock finished 2021 at around $1060, in the middle of a range for the final 2 months that saw highs above $1200 and a low just below $900. Tesla is set to report earnings the last week of January. Options are not pricing movement outside of that recent high or low until February. Here’s how that range translates into a $25 wide Iron Condor expiring Feb 18th, about a $1400 risk to $1000 reward profile (via Options AI):*“

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/gqyd4tvuqpa81.gif

TSLA made a big move higher right to the 1200 level to start last week. It failed there and pulled back sharply from that level and actually finished lower on the week overall. With the stock now $1027 its expected move for this week is roughly 6%, with consensus levels around 1090 and 960, and the expected move out to February 18th about 15%, with consensus levels around 1180 and 870.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 10th, 2022.

# **Inflation, rising rates and the Federal Reserve could whip stocks around in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/07/inflation-rising-rates-and-the-federal-reserve-could-whip-stocks-around-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; The bond market could again set the course for the week ahead, after rapidly rising interest rates gave stocks a choppy start to the new year.
*****
&gt; In the coming week, key inflation reports are expected, and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is slated to testify Tuesday at his nomination hearing before a Senate panel, while the hearing on Fed Governor Lael Brainard’s nomination to the post of vice chair is set for Thursday.
*****
&gt; The week also marks the start of the fourth-quarter earnings period with reports from major banks JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo on Friday.
*****
&gt; “Inflation and the Fed continue to be the theme next week, but I do think we’re looking forward to have some earnings results to sink our teeth into,” said Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer of BNY Mellon Wealth Management. “We do think it’s going to be a good quarter and a good year for earnings, which is why we’re generally upbeat on the prospect for earnings.”
*****
&gt; Grohowski said the markets will focus predominantly on the Powell and Brainard hearings, the consumer price index on Wednesday and the producer price index the next day.
*****
&gt; “I think it’s unrealistic to assume the earnings become the page-one story, and the Fed monetary policy becomes the page-two story,” he said.
*****
&gt; Stocks had a rough first week to 2022, as bond yields rose on both high expectations for Fed interest rate hikes and the view that the omicron variant of Covid is heading for a peak in a matter of weeks. Yields move higher when bonds sell off.
*****
&gt; Tech was particularly hard hit, with the Nasdaq Composite down 4.5% for the week, while the Dow was barely negative, down just 0.3%. The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund was off 4.6% as of Friday afternoon. But banks moved higher on the prospect that rising interest rates would help earnings. The Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund was up 5.4% for the week.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended the week at 4677, down 1.9%.
*****
&gt; “This week was a wake-up call for what we’re going to be dealing with for 2022,” said Grohowski. “Lower returns and more risk. Welcome to the new year.”
*****
&gt; Yields rose rapidly across the curve, but the dramatic move of the benchmark 10-year was particularly rattling for investors. The 10-year, which influences mortgages and other loans, rose from 1.51% in the final hour of 2021 trading to as high as 1.80% Friday.
*****
&gt; That makes it the second-biggest move in the yield for the first week of the year in 20 years, according to Wells Fargo.
*****
&gt; “It’s more dramatic than what we anticipated and the Fed’s pivot to a more hawkish stance has been the surprise,” said Grohowski. “Most market participants expected higher rates, less accommodative monetary policy, but when you look at the fed funds implying a 90% chance of a hike in March, on New Year’s Eve that was just 63%. There’s been a pretty dramatic change in tone picked up in the Fed minutes this week and markets are adjusting to that.”
*****
&gt; Powell’s hearing on Tuesday will be a highlight of the coming week, not because he is expected to make news, but because he is likely to echo the tone of the Fed minutes, released this past Wednesday.
*****
&gt; The central bank revealed in those minutes that officials are also discussing when to start shrinking its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet. The Fed has already forecast tightening policy with three quarter-point interest rate hikes this year, and downsizing its bond holdings would tighten it even further.
*****
&gt; Bond investors also reacted to the disappointing December jobs report Friday by sending interest rates higher. There were just 199,000 jobs created last month, less than half of what was expected. But the unemployment rate fell more than expected, to 3.9% from 4.2%. Average hourly wages rose by 0.6%, or 4.7% year over year.
*****
&gt; Economists blamed the weaker report in part on a lack of workers to fill jobs, but the Fed is expected to move to hike interest rates regardless.
*****
&gt; “This is the Fed saying we’re at full employment. There is still a gap, but the wage surge was much more than anyone expected and heavily concentrated in low-wage jobs,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton. “We’re about 3.5 million shy of the previous peak, and the labor market is behaving as if we’re beyond full employment.”
*****
&gt; Inflation will stay front and center with the CPI and PPI reports. Economists expect another hot month for both readings, though some economists believe inflation is close to its peak. November’s headline CPI of 6.8% was the highest since 1982.
*****
&gt; Stock investors will also continue to watch yields. Tech and growth stocks are the most sensitive to rising rates because investors pay for the promise of future earnings. Higher rates mean the cost of money increases and that changes the calculus on their investments.
*****
&gt; Grohowski expects the 10-year yield to reach 2.25% by the end of the year, though it has been moving faster than expected. “Getting there sooner causes more pain ... in those longer duration equity sectors, like tech and the Nasdaq,” he said. “I do think that yields settle down and that tech comes back. I think we’re going to see really good earnings this year. Tech continues to be a beneficiary.”
*****
&gt; Grohowski said the market could see a 10% decline in 2022, but he doubts that slump will happen in the near term because there is so much cash waiting to come into the market.
*****
&gt; “I think this dry powder will be put to work. I think we’re off to a kind of rough start and a reset,” he said. “I think ultimately this reset of expectations is going to be a healthy one. I do think market participants are getting a very early in the year wake-up call after the high returns and low volatility of last year and a doubling of the market in three years. [But] it’s going to be much rougher sledding in the next 12 to 18 months.”
*****
&gt; There are also three big Treasury auctions in the coming week, with the $52 billion 3-year note auction Tuesday, $36 billion in 10-year bonds Wednesday, and $22 billion in 30-year bonds Thursday.
*****
&gt; The 10-year popped as high as 1.80% Friday, but could easily return to that level in the coming week. That puts it just above the 2021 high.
*****
&gt; “In and around those levels, the market will try to find some short term support,” said Greg Faranello, head of U.S. rates at AmeriVet Securities. He added that the auction could be an event that helps cap the yield move for now.

&gt; # Yale Hirsch’s Santa Claus Rally &amp; January Barometer, Trifecta 2 out of 3 Ain’t Bad

&gt; My father Yale Hirsch invented both of these well-known seasonal indicators in 1972 and published them in the 1973 Stock Trader’s Almanacas you can see in the picture above on pages 11 and 111. He passed away late last year at the ripe old age of 98. Not only was he the illustrious founder of the Stock Trader’s Almanac, but he left me and everybody on the planet a rich legacy of seasonal patterns, strategies and indicators. Many of which he discovered, invented or devised. He also brought others to light with clarity and always full credit of course. And most importantly, from the first Almanacin 1968 Yale taught us all how to think differently about the markets and recurring market patterns. Thanks to him we have a plethora of tools in our analytical and statistical arsenal.

&gt; To quote the great Sir Isaac Newton, “If I have seen further, it is by standing upon the shoulders of giants.” We proudly stood on Yale’s giant shoulders when we created our “January Indicator Trifecta” back in January 2013. Which brings us to the present.

&gt; Combining our three January indicators, the Santa Claus Rally (SCR), First Five Days (FFD) and January Barometer (JB), into the “January Trifecta” has proven to be an especially reliable gauge for future market performance. When all three are positive, as was the case in 2019, the next eleven months have been up 87.1% of the time with an average gain of 12.3% and the full year advanced 90.3% of the time with an average S&amp;P 500 gain of 17.5%. The worst full-year decline in a year with a positive January Trifecta was 13.1% by S&amp;P 500 in 1966.

&gt; With less than two hours left in the First Five Days, S&amp;P 500 will need to gain more than 70.13 points (1.49%) by the close to keep the bullish January Indicator Trifecta alive in 2022. Since the odds of that happening are slim at this juncture that leaves three possible scenarios for our “January Indicator Trifecta:” SCR up and both FFD and JB down (8 occurrences since 1950 with last 11 months up 2/down 6, average -5.8%, full year up 1/down 7 average -9.4%); SCR up, FFD up and JB down (12 occurrences since 1950 with last 11 months up 10/down 2, average 9.9%, full year up 9/down 3 average 6.0%); or SCR up, FFD down and JB up (6 occurrences since 1950 with last 11 months up 5/down 1, average 9.7%, full year up 5/down 1 average 11.8%). So, two out of three ain’t bad. (See the tables below.)

&gt; Wednesday’s market decline was triggered by a much more hawkish Fed perception following the release of last month’s FOMC Meeting minutes. A more aggressive removal of Fed liquidity could aid in pulling back inflation and it could pressure stocks as bond yields rise. We will withhold final judgement until the final results of the January Barometer arrive. Our base case scenario from our 2022 Annual Forecast is still our pick at this juncture.

&gt; As the opening of the New Year, January is host to many important events, indicators and recurring market patterns. U.S. Presidents are inaugurated and usually present State of the Union Addresses. New Congresses convene. Financial analysts release annual forecasts. Residents of earth return to work and school en masse after holiday celebrations. On January’s second trading day, the results of the official Santa Claus Rally are known and on the fifth trading day the First Five Days “Early Warning” system sounds off, but it is the whole-month gain or loss of the S&amp;P 500 that triggers our January Barometer.

&gt; As defined in the Stock Trader’s Almanac, the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) is the propensity for the S&amp;P 500 to rally the last five trading days of December and the first two of January an average of 1.3% since 1950. The lack of a rally can be a preliminary indicator of tough times to come. This was certainly the case in 2008 and 2000. A 4.0% decline in 2000 foreshadowed the bursting of the tech bubble and a 2.5% loss in 2008 preceded the second worst bear market in history.

&gt; The January Barometer (JB) has registered 12 major errors since 1950 for an 83.3% accuracy ratio. Including the eight flat years yields a .722 batting average. Over the years there has been much debate regarding the efficacy of our January Barometer.

&gt; # January Almanac: Typical January Weaker Last 21 Years

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/0db7be701e8b12ea99121a7d8ee4058c/472f14a607c3f433-51/s500x750/3f1ad549d35e5c06e7ff3855881152a43e468520.jpg))**

&gt; January has quite a reputation on Wall Street as an influx of cash from yearend bonuses and annual allocations has historically propelled stocks higher. January ranks #1 for NASDAQ (since 1971), but fifth on the S&amp;P 500 and DJIA since 1950. January is the last month of the best three-month span and holds a full docket of indicators and seasonalities.

&gt; DJIA and S&amp;P rankings did slip from 2000 to 2016 as both indices suffered losses in ten of those seventeen Januarys with three in a row, 2008, 2009 and 2010 and then again in 2014 to 2016. January 2009 has the dubious honor of being the worst January on record for DJIA (-8.8%) and S&amp;P 500 (-8.6%) since 1901 and 1931 respectively. The early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic spoiled January in 2020 &amp; 2021 as DJIA, S&amp;P 500, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 all suffered declines in 2020. In 2021, DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 declined.

&gt; As you can see in the chart above of the Typical January Performance over the last 21 years diverging market performance across the major indexes like we saw today is not unusual behavior during January in recent years. Since 2001, the S&amp;P 500, DJIA, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 have all declined eleven times in twenty-one years in January. DJIA and S&amp;P have posted minor average losses while R1K and R2K have posted fractional gains.

&gt; Over the last 21 years, only NASDAQ has posted a full-month average gain of 1.0% up 12 of 21. All started January positive, only to surrender early-month gains by the end of the month. Weakness has historically accelerated just after mid-month, around the eleventh trading day.

&gt; In midterm years, January ranks near the bottom since 1950. Large-caps have been the worst with S&amp;P 500 ranking #10 (third worst) with DJIA and Russell 1000 ranking #9. Technology and small-cap shares fare slightly better in the rankings, but small-cap average performance is still negative and NASDAQ is only barely positive.

&gt; On pages 112 and 114 of the Stock Trader’s Almanac 2022 we illustrate that the January Effect, where small caps begin to outperform large caps, actually tends to start in mid-December. Early signs of the January Effect can be seen when comparing iShares Russell 2000 (IWM) to SPDR S&amp;P 500 (SPY) since around December 15. Historically, the majority of small-cap outperformance is normally done by mid-February, but strength can last until mid-May when indices typically reach a seasonal high.

&gt; # ARK Innovation (ARKK) Now Underperforming QQQ Since the Pre-COVID Peak

&gt; After further declines to start 2022, the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) is now up just 47.3% since the pre-COVID peak for the US equity market on 2/19/20 and is now only beating the S&amp;P 500 by 6.66 percentage points since the pre-COVID high. Not only that, but it's also underperforming the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) by 17.9 percentage points.

&gt; ARKK was the envy of the industry in the year or so after the pandemic hit. Fund assets for the ARKK ETF went from $2.4 billion prior to COVID up to $28.5 billion at its peak last February. At its high, ARKK was absolutely crushing both SPY and QQQ. On 2/12/21, ARKK was outperforming SPY by 143 percentage points since the 2/19/20 pre-COVID peak for the stock market and beating the more tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 by 117 percentage points. Since its peak, ARKK has dropped more than 43%, allowing the more steady SPY and QQQ to catch up. Talk about a real-life ""tortoise and the hare"" scenario!

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/01/arkkqqqspread.png))**

&gt; Interestingly, if we look at ARKK's annualized price change from its launch in October 2014 through the pre-COVID peak for the stock market on 2/19/20, it's roughly the same as ARKK's annualized price change since the 2/19/20 pre-COVID peak: ~22.8%. Also, throughout its history, ARKK's annualized total return still stands at ~24.3%, which is nearly 10 percentage points better than SPY's annualized total return of 14.8% over the same time frame.

&gt; # IPO Death Cross

&gt; The past two years have seen an explosion in new equity issuance in terms of the number of deals, and especially in terms of the dollar value of those deals. According to Bloomberg data, US average monthly issuance has been $23.83 billion over the past year. That is well above any point in the past few decades including the late 1990s. The actual number of stocks hitting the market has also set records this year, surpassing the 1990s peak.

&gt; While there has been a huge slug of new issuance, the performance of these names have been lackluster. The Renaissance IPO ETF (IPO) does not necessarily track every new name to hit the market, but it does act as a reasonably good proxy for the space. IPO reached an all-time high early in the year in February, but since then it has generally been rangebound fluctuating around its moving averages. Since the fall, and particularly in the past month and a half, the ETF has taken a significant leg lower. IPO has now fallen over 18% since the October 25th closing high, taking out its moving averages in the process. Today, IPO is setting up for what is typically viewed as a negative technical pattern: the death cross (when a downward sloping 50-DMA falls below a downward sloping 200-DMA).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/12/122921-IPO-1.png))**

&gt; IPO does not have an extremely extensive history only going back to October 2013, and as such, there is only a small handful of prior examples of other death crosses without another instance in the prior three months. In the table below, we show those past instances. Albeit there is a small sample size, contrary to the name and pattern's reputation, prior death crosses have generally been followed by decent performance going forward.

&gt; # Santa Came To Town And 5 More Charts To Watch

&gt; Here is one chart about Santa and five more charts (or tables) that caught our attention recently.

&gt; Well, stocks did what they were supposed to do, which was gain during the historically bullish Santa Claus Rally (last 5 days of the year and first 2 days of the following year). We discussed this seasonally bullish period here, but the bottom line is we expected these days to be strong. It is when Santa doesn’t come to town that makes us worry. In fact, three of the past four times he didn’t come (2000, 2008, and 2015) saw stocks fall for the full year and the last five times he didn’t show all saw January lower. Only 2016 avoided a drop for the full year when Santa didn’t show, but that year started off with one of the worst first six weeks ever, so Santa was still a warning sign.

&gt; Mark this off as one less thing to worry about in 2022.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/blog-1.5.22-1-.png))**

&gt; Just because stocks were up big last year by itself isn’t a reason to worry. “The truth is big yearly gains likely take place in larger bull markets, so don’t get a fear of heights just because of what happened in 2021,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “In fact, the past seven times the S&amp;P 500 gained more than 25% saw the next year higher, with five of those years up double digits.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the day, the S&amp;P 500 is up nearly 12% on average and higher 86% of the time after it is up 25% the year before. There are lots of worries out there, but ‘stocks being up a lot and that is why I’m bearish’ shouldn’t be one of them.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Blog-1.5.22-2-.png))**

&gt; The first day of 2022 started off with a rare all-time high on Day 1. We were surprised, as this has only happened five other times in history. Let’s be clear, we would never suggest investing based on one day, but years that make a new high on the first day actually see a strong January and strong full year return. Not to mention nearly 40 all-time highs on average along the way.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/blog-1.5.22-3-.png))**

&gt; Taking this a step further, stocks not only made new highs, but it was a strong Day 1 as well. Below you will see that previous times the first day of the year gained more than 0.6% saw stronger than average January and full year returns. Again, don’t blindly invest on only this one signal, but it is quite interesting.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/blog-1.5.22-4-.png))**

&gt; The fourth quarter of 2021 went out like a champ, gaining more than 10% in the process. Turns out, 10% gains likely mean continued strength. Incredibly, the S&amp;P 500 was higher two quarters later the past 12 times the S&amp;P 500 gained more than 10% in a quarter. Again, this is just one study, but it does little to change the view that the bull market is likely alive and well in 2022.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/blog-1.5.22-5-.png))**

&gt; Another eye-opening stat is the S&amp;P 500 is up 7 consecutive quarters, one of the longest quarterly win streaks ever. Turns out that future strength is more common than you might think. Two quarters later the S&amp;P 500 has never been lower and a year later up a very solid 14.1% on average. In fact, you have to go back to the early 1950s for the last time a quarterly win streak ended at 7, as they usually manage to go further than most think.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great week ahead r/stocks. :)",18,6,1641659209.0,2022-01-08T16:26:49+00:00,t3_rz3ls3,stocks
224,TSM,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning January 10th, 2022","Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/StockMarket! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. :)

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 10th, 2022.

# **Inflation, rising rates and the Federal Reserve could whip stocks around in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/07/inflation-rising-rates-and-the-federal-reserve-could-whip-stocks-around-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; The bond market could again set the course for the week ahead, after rapidly rising interest rates gave stocks a choppy start to the new year.
*****
&gt; In the coming week, key inflation reports are expected, and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is slated to testify Tuesday at his nomination hearing before a Senate panel, while the hearing on Fed Governor Lael Brainard’s nomination to the post of vice chair is set for Thursday.
*****
&gt; The week also marks the start of the fourth-quarter earnings period with reports from major banks JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo on Friday.
*****
&gt; “Inflation and the Fed continue to be the theme next week, but I do think we’re looking forward to have some earnings results to sink our teeth into,” said Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer of BNY Mellon Wealth Management. “We do think it’s going to be a good quarter and a good year for earnings, which is why we’re generally upbeat on the prospect for earnings.”
*****
&gt; Grohowski said the markets will focus predominantly on the Powell and Brainard hearings, the consumer price index on Wednesday and the producer price index the next day.
*****
&gt; “I think it’s unrealistic to assume the earnings become the page-one story, and the Fed monetary policy becomes the page-two story,” he said.
*****
&gt; Stocks had a rough first week to 2022, as bond yields rose on both high expectations for Fed interest rate hikes and the view that the omicron variant of Covid is heading for a peak in a matter of weeks. Yields move higher when bonds sell off.
*****
&gt; Tech was particularly hard hit, with the Nasdaq Composite down 4.5% for the week, while the Dow was barely negative, down just 0.3%. The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund was off 4.6% as of Friday afternoon. But banks moved higher on the prospect that rising interest rates would help earnings. The Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund was up 5.4% for the week.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended the week at 4677, down 1.9%.
*****
&gt; “This week was a wake-up call for what we’re going to be dealing with for 2022,” said Grohowski. “Lower returns and more risk. Welcome to the new year.”
*****
&gt; Yields rose rapidly across the curve, but the dramatic move of the benchmark 10-year was particularly rattling for investors. The 10-year, which influences mortgages and other loans, rose from 1.51% in the final hour of 2021 trading to as high as 1.80% Friday.
*****
&gt; That makes it the second-biggest move in the yield for the first week of the year in 20 years, according to Wells Fargo.
*****
&gt; “It’s more dramatic than what we anticipated and the Fed’s pivot to a more hawkish stance has been the surprise,” said Grohowski. “Most market participants expected higher rates, less accommodative monetary policy, but when you look at the fed funds implying a 90% chance of a hike in March, on New Year’s Eve that was just 63%. There’s been a pretty dramatic change in tone picked up in the Fed minutes this week and markets are adjusting to that.”
*****
&gt; Powell’s hearing on Tuesday will be a highlight of the coming week, not because he is expected to make news, but because he is likely to echo the tone of the Fed minutes, released this past Wednesday.
*****
&gt; The central bank revealed in those minutes that officials are also discussing when to start shrinking its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet. The Fed has already forecast tightening policy with three quarter-point interest rate hikes this year, and downsizing its bond holdings would tighten it even further.
*****
&gt; Bond investors also reacted to the disappointing December jobs report Friday by sending interest rates higher. There were just 199,000 jobs created last month, less than half of what was expected. But the unemployment rate fell more than expected, to 3.9% from 4.2%. Average hourly wages rose by 0.6%, or 4.7% year over year.
*****
&gt; Economists blamed the weaker report in part on a lack of workers to fill jobs, but the Fed is expected to move to hike interest rates regardless.
*****
&gt; “This is the Fed saying we’re at full employment. There is still a gap, but the wage surge was much more than anyone expected and heavily concentrated in low-wage jobs,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton. “We’re about 3.5 million shy of the previous peak, and the labor market is behaving as if we’re beyond full employment.”
*****
&gt; Inflation will stay front and center with the CPI and PPI reports. Economists expect another hot month for both readings, though some economists believe inflation is close to its peak. November’s headline CPI of 6.8% was the highest since 1982.
*****
&gt; Stock investors will also continue to watch yields. Tech and growth stocks are the most sensitive to rising rates because investors pay for the promise of future earnings. Higher rates mean the cost of money increases and that changes the calculus on their investments.
*****
&gt; Grohowski expects the 10-year yield to reach 2.25% by the end of the year, though it has been moving faster than expected. “Getting there sooner causes more pain ... in those longer duration equity sectors, like tech and the Nasdaq,” he said. “I do think that yields settle down and that tech comes back. I think we’re going to see really good earnings this year. Tech continues to be a beneficiary.”
*****
&gt; Grohowski said the market could see a 10% decline in 2022, but he doubts that slump will happen in the near term because there is so much cash waiting to come into the market.
*****
&gt; “I think this dry powder will be put to work. I think we’re off to a kind of rough start and a reset,” he said. “I think ultimately this reset of expectations is going to be a healthy one. I do think market participants are getting a very early in the year wake-up call after the high returns and low volatility of last year and a doubling of the market in three years. [But] it’s going to be much rougher sledding in the next 12 to 18 months.”
*****
&gt; There are also three big Treasury auctions in the coming week, with the $52 billion 3-year note auction Tuesday, $36 billion in 10-year bonds Wednesday, and $22 billion in 30-year bonds Thursday.
*****
&gt; The 10-year popped as high as 1.80% Friday, but could easily return to that level in the coming week. That puts it just above the 2021 high.
*****
&gt; “In and around those levels, the market will try to find some short term support,” said Greg Faranello, head of U.S. rates at AmeriVet Securities. He added that the auction could be an event that helps cap the yield move for now.

&gt; # Yale Hirsch’s Santa Claus Rally &amp; January Barometer, Trifecta 2 out of 3 Ain’t Bad

&gt; My father Yale Hirsch invented both of these well-known seasonal indicators in 1972 and published them in the 1973 Stock Trader’s Almanacas you can see in the picture above on pages 11 and 111. He passed away late last year at the ripe old age of 98. Not only was he the illustrious founder of the Stock Trader’s Almanac, but he left me and everybody on the planet a rich legacy of seasonal patterns, strategies and indicators. Many of which he discovered, invented or devised. He also brought others to light with clarity and always full credit of course. And most importantly, from the first Almanacin 1968 Yale taught us all how to think differently about the markets and recurring market patterns. Thanks to him we have a plethora of tools in our analytical and statistical arsenal.

&gt; To quote the great Sir Isaac Newton, “If I have seen further, it is by standing upon the shoulders of giants.” We proudly stood on Yale’s giant shoulders when we created our “January Indicator Trifecta” back in January 2013. Which brings us to the present.

&gt; Combining our three January indicators, the Santa Claus Rally (SCR), First Five Days (FFD) and January Barometer (JB), into the “January Trifecta” has proven to be an especially reliable gauge for future market performance. When all three are positive, as was the case in 2019, the next eleven months have been up 87.1% of the time with an average gain of 12.3% and the full year advanced 90.3% of the time with an average S&amp;P 500 gain of 17.5%. The worst full-year decline in a year with a positive January Trifecta was 13.1% by S&amp;P 500 in 1966.

&gt; With less than two hours left in the First Five Days, S&amp;P 500 will need to gain more than 70.13 points (1.49%) by the close to keep the bullish January Indicator Trifecta alive in 2022. Since the odds of that happening are slim at this juncture that leaves three possible scenarios for our “January Indicator Trifecta:” SCR up and both FFD and JB down (8 occurrences since 1950 with last 11 months up 2/down 6, average -5.8%, full year up 1/down 7 average -9.4%); SCR up, FFD up and JB down (12 occurrences since 1950 with last 11 months up 10/down 2, average 9.9%, full year up 9/down 3 average 6.0%); or SCR up, FFD down and JB up (6 occurrences since 1950 with last 11 months up 5/down 1, average 9.7%, full year up 5/down 1 average 11.8%). So, two out of three ain’t bad. (See the tables below.)

&gt; Wednesday’s market decline was triggered by a much more hawkish Fed perception following the release of last month’s FOMC Meeting minutes. A more aggressive removal of Fed liquidity could aid in pulling back inflation and it could pressure stocks as bond yields rise. We will withhold final judgement until the final results of the January Barometer arrive. Our base case scenario from our 2022 Annual Forecast is still our pick at this juncture.

&gt; As the opening of the New Year, January is host to many important events, indicators and recurring market patterns. U.S. Presidents are inaugurated and usually present State of the Union Addresses. New Congresses convene. Financial analysts release annual forecasts. Residents of earth return to work and school en masse after holiday celebrations. On January’s second trading day, the results of the official Santa Claus Rally are known and on the fifth trading day the First Five Days “Early Warning” system sounds off, but it is the whole-month gain or loss of the S&amp;P 500 that triggers our January Barometer.

&gt; As defined in the Stock Trader’s Almanac, the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) is the propensity for the S&amp;P 500 to rally the last five trading days of December and the first two of January an average of 1.3% since 1950. The lack of a rally can be a preliminary indicator of tough times to come. This was certainly the case in 2008 and 2000. A 4.0% decline in 2000 foreshadowed the bursting of the tech bubble and a 2.5% loss in 2008 preceded the second worst bear market in history.

&gt; The January Barometer (JB) has registered 12 major errors since 1950 for an 83.3% accuracy ratio. Including the eight flat years yields a .722 batting average. Over the years there has been much debate regarding the efficacy of our January Barometer.

&gt; # January Almanac: Typical January Weaker Last 21 Years

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/0db7be701e8b12ea99121a7d8ee4058c/472f14a607c3f433-51/s500x750/3f1ad549d35e5c06e7ff3855881152a43e468520.jpg))**

&gt; January has quite a reputation on Wall Street as an influx of cash from yearend bonuses and annual allocations has historically propelled stocks higher. January ranks #1 for NASDAQ (since 1971), but fifth on the S&amp;P 500 and DJIA since 1950. January is the last month of the best three-month span and holds a full docket of indicators and seasonalities.

&gt; DJIA and S&amp;P rankings did slip from 2000 to 2016 as both indices suffered losses in ten of those seventeen Januarys with three in a row, 2008, 2009 and 2010 and then again in 2014 to 2016. January 2009 has the dubious honor of being the worst January on record for DJIA (-8.8%) and S&amp;P 500 (-8.6%) since 1901 and 1931 respectively. The early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic spoiled January in 2020 &amp; 2021 as DJIA, S&amp;P 500, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 all suffered declines in 2020. In 2021, DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 declined.

&gt; As you can see in the chart above of the Typical January Performance over the last 21 years diverging market performance across the major indexes like we saw today is not unusual behavior during January in recent years. Since 2001, the S&amp;P 500, DJIA, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 have all declined eleven times in twenty-one years in January. DJIA and S&amp;P have posted minor average losses while R1K and R2K have posted fractional gains.

&gt; Over the last 21 years, only NASDAQ has posted a full-month average gain of 1.0% up 12 of 21. All started January positive, only to surrender early-month gains by the end of the month. Weakness has historically accelerated just after mid-month, around the eleventh trading day.

&gt; In midterm years, January ranks near the bottom since 1950. Large-caps have been the worst with S&amp;P 500 ranking #10 (third worst) with DJIA and Russell 1000 ranking #9. Technology and small-cap shares fare slightly better in the rankings, but small-cap average performance is still negative and NASDAQ is only barely positive.

&gt; On pages 112 and 114 of the Stock Trader’s Almanac 2022 we illustrate that the January Effect, where small caps begin to outperform large caps, actually tends to start in mid-December. Early signs of the January Effect can be seen when comparing iShares Russell 2000 (IWM) to SPDR S&amp;P 500 (SPY) since around December 15. Historically, the majority of small-cap outperformance is normally done by mid-February, but strength can last until mid-May when indices typically reach a seasonal high.

&gt; # ARK Innovation (ARKK) Now Underperforming QQQ Since the Pre-COVID Peak

&gt; After further declines to start 2022, the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) is now up just 47.3% since the pre-COVID peak for the US equity market on 2/19/20 and is now only beating the S&amp;P 500 by 6.66 percentage points since the pre-COVID high. Not only that, but it's also underperforming the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) by 17.9 percentage points.

&gt; ARKK was the envy of the industry in the year or so after the pandemic hit. Fund assets for the ARKK ETF went from $2.4 billion prior to COVID up to $28.5 billion at its peak last February. At its high, ARKK was absolutely crushing both SPY and QQQ. On 2/12/21, ARKK was outperforming SPY by 143 percentage points since the 2/19/20 pre-COVID peak for the stock market and beating the more tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 by 117 percentage points. Since its peak, ARKK has dropped more than 43%, allowing the more steady SPY and QQQ to catch up. Talk about a real-life ""tortoise and the hare"" scenario!

&gt; Interestingly, if we look at ARKK's annualized price change from its launch in October 2014 through the pre-COVID peak for the stock market on 2/19/20, it's roughly the same as ARKK's annualized price change since the 2/19/20 pre-COVID peak: ~22.8%. Also, throughout its history, ARKK's annualized total return still stands at ~24.3%, which is nearly 10 percentage points better than SPY's annualized total return of 14.8% over the same time frame.

&gt; # IPO Death Cross

&gt; The past two years have seen an explosion in new equity issuance in terms of the number of deals, and especially in terms of the dollar value of those deals. According to Bloomberg data, US average monthly issuance has been $23.83 billion over the past year. That is well above any point in the past few decades including the late 1990s. The actual number of stocks hitting the market has also set records this year, surpassing the 1990s peak.

&gt; While there has been a huge slug of new issuance, the performance of these names have been lackluster. The Renaissance IPO ETF (IPO) does not necessarily track every new name to hit the market, but it does act as a reasonably good proxy for the space. IPO reached an all-time high early in the year in February, but since then it has generally been rangebound fluctuating around its moving averages. Since the fall, and particularly in the past month and a half, the ETF has taken a significant leg lower. IPO has now fallen over 18% since the October 25th closing high, taking out its moving averages in the process. Today, IPO is setting up for what is typically viewed as a negative technical pattern: the death cross (when a downward sloping 50-DMA falls below a downward sloping 200-DMA).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/12/122921-IPO-1.png))**

&gt; IPO does not have an extremely extensive history only going back to October 2013, and as such, there is only a small handful of prior examples of other death crosses without another instance in the prior three months. In the table below, we show those past instances. Albeit there is a small sample size, contrary to the name and pattern's reputation, prior death crosses have generally been followed by decent performance going forward.

&gt; # Santa Came To Town And 5 More Charts To Watch

&gt; Here is one chart about Santa and five more charts (or tables) that caught our attention recently.

&gt; Well, stocks did what they were supposed to do, which was gain during the historically bullish Santa Claus Rally (last 5 days of the year and first 2 days of the following year). We discussed this seasonally bullish period here, but the bottom line is we expected these days to be strong. It is when Santa doesn’t come to town that makes us worry. In fact, three of the past four times he didn’t come (2000, 2008, and 2015) saw stocks fall for the full year and the last five times he didn’t show all saw January lower. Only 2016 avoided a drop for the full year when Santa didn’t show, but that year started off with one of the worst first six weeks ever, so Santa was still a warning sign.

&gt; Mark this off as one less thing to worry about in 2022.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/blog-1.5.22-1-.png))**

&gt; Just because stocks were up big last year by itself isn’t a reason to worry. “The truth is big yearly gains likely take place in larger bull markets, so don’t get a fear of heights just because of what happened in 2021,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “In fact, the past seven times the S&amp;P 500 gained more than 25% saw the next year higher, with five of those years up double digits.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the day, the S&amp;P 500 is up nearly 12% on average and higher 86% of the time after it is up 25% the year before. There are lots of worries out there, but ‘stocks being up a lot and that is why I’m bearish’ shouldn’t be one of them.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Blog-1.5.22-2-.png))**

&gt; The first day of 2022 started off with a rare all-time high on Day 1. We were surprised, as this has only happened five other times in history. Let’s be clear, we would never suggest investing based on one day, but years that make a new high on the first day actually see a strong January and strong full year return. Not to mention nearly 40 all-time highs on average along the way.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/blog-1.5.22-3-.png))**

&gt; Taking this a step further, stocks not only made new highs, but it was a strong Day 1 as well. Below you will see that previous times the first day of the year gained more than 0.6% saw stronger than average January and full year returns. Again, don’t blindly invest on only this one signal, but it is quite interesting.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/blog-1.5.22-4-.png))**

&gt; The fourth quarter of 2021 went out like a champ, gaining more than 10% in the process. Turns out, 10% gains likely mean continued strength. Incredibly, the S&amp;P 500 was higher two quarters later the past 12 times the S&amp;P 500 gained more than 10% in a quarter. Again, this is just one study, but it does little to change the view that the bull market is likely alive and well in 2022.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/blog-1.5.22-5-.png))**

&gt; Another eye-opening stat is the S&amp;P 500 is up 7 consecutive quarters, one of the longest quarterly win streaks ever. Turns out that future strength is more common than you might think. Two quarters later the S&amp;P 500 has never been lower and a year later up a very solid 14.1% on average. In fact, you have to go back to the early 1950s for the last time a quarterly win streak ended at 7, as they usually manage to go further than most think.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great week ahead r/StockMarket. :)",158,22,1641658980.0,2022-01-08T16:23:00+00:00,t3_rz3isw,StockMarket
130,TSM,Question about Higher Interest Rates and Bank Stocks,"So as a fairly new investor who is trying to wrap around his head on the whole market reactions to FED and higher interest rates I would like to ask some advice from former investors who have seen crashes and basically who has spent much more time in the market than I did.

My first reaction was to sell all my profit positions which were AMAT and TSM. I have also took profit on the crypto positions(I know it is not supposed to be mentioned here but its just for the sake of the post so please forgive me). I have left the bleeding positions on red which are NVDIA and AMD

I also thought since the cost of borrowing money will be more starting from march maybe it is a good idea to buy some bank stocks like Citigroup and Bank of America and I have opened very small positions on these. Besides this I am currently sitting in roughly 18% cash.

So my question is do you think buying more of bank stocks actually make sense or should I just wait more and as soon as market starts to recover should I scoop the dips on these aforementioned growth stocks?",1,14,1641424017.0,2022-01-05T23:06:57+00:00,t3_rwzhtj,stocks
58,TSM,"First time rolling a call, need some help","After almost a year of stagnation and selling CCs safely finally TSM is moving..and my CCs with strike of 131 is blown, but I really like the company, I don´t want to get rid of the shares, sould I roll up?

Its the first time Im on that situation, Im usually happy being assigned and I never roll any option, put or call, in my 6 months selling them, need help, how I sould proceed in this case to do the trade optimally?

My 131 call expire this friday, Sould I wait for the last day to get rid of the extrinsic value (and maybe wait for a possible pullback)? or do it now while the stock price is booming? Help me theta gang, I want to learn.",4,9,1641308638.0,2022-01-04T15:03:58+00:00,t3_rvwe8v,thetagang

* XPEV: Significant support level at 50. Will be watching for more movement to the upside, potential resistance level around 55. 
* GM: Will likely see significant resistance around 60, but worth keeping an eye on. 
* TSM: Potential resistance level at 125. Potential support in the 123.20-123.60 area. 
* AMD: Potential support level around 145. If it holds up I'll watch for upwards movement towards 150 resistance; if it breaks down, we could see some choppiness. 
* COIN: Will be watching resistance level at 260. Room for upside if it can break through resistance, could see some choppiness if it rejects. 
* LOGI: Will be watching for more upwards movement if it can hold up over 84 support. 

Gapping DOWN:

* ROKU: I'll be watching 228 as potential resistance this morning. Significant support level around 222. 
* JD: Potential resistance level at 70. 
* PDD: Will want to see it find support above 58, then will watch for upwards movement towards resistance level at 60. 

**Momentum Watchlist:**

* FRO: Will be watching for more movement to the upside if it can find support above 7.50. Won't be too interested if it breaks down and cannot recover. 
* AFI: Potential premarket support at around 2.50. Premarket high at \~2.82.
* SYTA: Potential resistance levels at 4.25 and 4.50. 
* WAVE: Was seeing some volatility earlier in premarket, will be keeping an eye on it. Potential resistance at 5. 

**Market Outlook:**

Stocks are looking to start off 2022 on a green note, with the major indices hovering near ATH levels. The blue chip stocks did especially well last year, riding strong earnings throughout the year. Rising labor costs and decelerating economic growth could hurt earnings for some of these companies, so it will be interesting to see what 2022 brings. Inflation and economic policy figure to remain hot topics in 2022, with the Fed planning on hiking interest rates in an effort to curb inflation. COVID fears are being brushed aside at the moment, as the omicron variant seems less severe than the other variants. Worth noting that a more severe variant could cause worldwide problems once again. 

S&amp;P Futures are up \~50 basis points, Dow Futures are up \~40 basis points, and Nasdaq Futures are up \~60 basis points. Gold and silver are down a bit this morning, seeing some weakness earlier this morning. Crude oil is trading slightly lower. Also seeing some weakness this morning, I'll be watching the $75 level as potential resistance. EV stocks are seeing some strength to start 2022. TSLA reported record numbers for deliveries in Q4, and is currently up around 7% in premarket trading. Semiconductor stocks are up in premarket trading as well. After a slight pullback over the past few days, they could be ready for some renewed strength. Airlines and cruise stocks are trading slightly higher, looking to build on the recent strength. The crypto market is mixed at the moment after a quiet weekend. Bitcoin is currently trading around 47,300. Major support around the 45,000-45,500 level if we see weakness. Crypto-related stocks are up in premarket trading.

Remember to use proper risk management; size appropriately for your account and have a plan for every trade you enter. Happy trading everyone :)",7,11,1641219669.0,2022-01-03T14:21:09+00:00,t3_rv2rh9,StockMarket
59,TSM,Question on a Put Debit Spread,"I’m looking at a Put Debit Spread for a 27DTE on TSM, from 155/150, for a COST of 475, with a possibility to gain 25$.   I’ve never ran something like this, but have been following the chart and stock for a hot minute.  

My question is, if I opened this, I would pay 475, and would assume that on the last few days (let’s say the stock went up to 140 but below what is listed as my break even of 150.25, does it just show the bought put as essentially worthless and the sold as a .25 value?


This is mentally breaking my mind and I’ve asked friends but I’m not getting a concrete answer.  

I believe if this would also be considered a deep in the money Put debit spread not out of the money.  

Thanks for the help of anyone replies, and I know this isn’t technically a theta strategy, but it kind of is.

131,TSM,Watch out for Hyped Junk Stocks in 2022,"Hyped up stocks ruined a lot of investors in 2021 and will continue doing so in the future. I was looking at how Nikola was doing right now, and it is trading at a valuation of fucking $4B dollars. An overhyped, almost borderline fraud company, with less than $100K revenue and not a single vehicle delivered is trading at such absurd valuation. You know what's even more crazy. In June 2020, Nikola traded at a valuation of $25B, a market cap equal to quarter market cap of gargantuan organization like Citibank that had a revenue of $70B. A $25B valuation with no sales and no revenue to show for it. Just goes to show how much people will fall into these hype traps. Eventually, Nikola crashed but still it is massively overvalued. Nikola is just one example and there are hundreds if not thousands of such stocks.

Invest in cashflow rich companies with steady growth and good margins and you will never go wrong. Think AAPL, MSFT, GOOG, TSM, COST, V, to name a few. Do your own DD and think of buying a stock as buying a piece of that company for the long haul. One of my favourite quotes from Warren Buffett is that ""When you buy a stock, think that if the stock market were to close down for a decade, would I be happy with owning this business? If the answer is resounding yes for you, then only you should buy it."" 

Good luck stock picking and Happy new year!",122,106,1641022105.0,2022-01-01T07:28:25+00:00,t3_rte996,stocks

133,TSM,"Hypothetical: China begins invasion of Taiwan, does Intel stock go up or down?","There are two schools of thought on this:

* Intel stock goes up because TSM's production is cut off, therefore greatly hampering fabless chip companies like AMD or NVDA.

* Intel stock goes down, because while Intel has American fabs, a lot of the components and packaging are still done in Asia so a war in that region will still lock down Intel's production. Plus TSM makes chips for Intel as well.

For purpose of this hypothetical, assume that the war is contained to just between China and Taiwan (e.g. United States is not sending troops and no one is talking about firing nooks or ICBMs in retaliation).

If your answer is ""Intel goes down"", then does it go down as much as AMD would?",3,60,1640308979.0,2021-12-24T01:22:59+00:00,t3_rnakit,stocks

**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, December 21, 2021**

***Apologies for no recap yesterday, I was traveling all day back home to spend Christmas with my parents***

The market staged a comeback on Tuesday, with all three major indexes rising more than 1% as market participants digested news of federal involvement to help mitigate the spread of Omicron and the imminent authorization of an at-home COVID treatment.

The Biden administration announced it was buying 500 million at-home rapid coronavirus tests that Amercians will be able to order online for free starting in January. This comes following a report that Omicron has now become the dominant variant in the US, accounting for roughly 73% of all cases reported last week.

New COVID-19 cases rose 9% in the United States in the past week but are up 57% since the start of December, according to a Reuters tally. [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-20/omicron-surges-to-nearly-three-quarters-of-u-s-virus-cases](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-20/omicron-surges-to-nearly-three-quarters-of-u-s-virus-cases)

Moreover, the White House will deploy 1,000 military personnel to assist at hospitals as capacity starts filling up.   The number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients has increased 26% this month, with hospitals in some areas already strained by the Delta variant that emerged earlier this year, according to that same Reuters tally.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which is in charge of approving and regulating new medications, is expected to authorize the Pfizer (PFE) and Merck (MRK) coronavirus treatment pills this week.

Last week, Pfizer reported that its COVID pill showed near 90% efficacy in preventing hospitalizations and deaths in high-risk patients, and recent lab data suggests the drug retains its effectiveness against the fast spreading Omicron variant of the coronavirus.

Meera Pandit, global market strategist at JP Morgan, said “On the virus side, ultimately what we’ve seen with prior surges and prior variants is that market sell-offs tend to be somewhat contained to a period of time, so we do expect that as we get better and better at dealing with some of these challenges from the economic and market perspective, things will likely settle down despite some of the public health challenges we have ahead.”

In other news, market participants are also processing an unexpected blow to Biden's economic agenda after Senator Joe Manchin (D., W. Va.) quashed the administration’s long-deliberated Build Back Better Act, citing concerns about inflation, the national debt and ongoing pandemic.

Looking ahead, there is tons of important economic coming out:

* Wednesday - The Conference Board is set to release its latest consumer confidence index, expected to show an only modest uptick for the month of December.
* Thursday - Bureau of Economic Analysis will publish Personal Consumption Expenditures, the Fed’s preferred measurement for inflation. Consensus data compiled by Bloomberg showed PCE is projected to climb at a 0.6% month-over-month rate in November.

**Highlights**

* President Joe Biden in remarks Tuesday afternoon said he was considering a reversal of recent travel restrictions in light of Omicron
* AT&amp;T Inc said on Tuesday it was selling its advertising unit, Xandr, to Microsoft. Xandr was created in 2018 through the acquisition of an ad exchange and a TV ad tech company to use data collected from phone, internet and TV services to target consumers.
* Following the blocking infrastructure bill, Goldmans Sachs (GS) and Mark Zandi, chief economists at Moody’s, cut US GDP forecasts for 2022.
* Moody’s, one of the main credit ratings agencies in the US, once again gave Apple the highest ‘AAA’ credit
* The EU approved Microsoft’s (MSFT) $16 billion acquisition of Nuance, an AI-powered text to speech company
* Workers at a Starbucks (SBUX) store in Seattle, the coffee giant’s hometown, say they aim to unionize, adding momentum to the organizing efforts at the chain.
* Global merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) activity shattered all-time records in 2021,  $5 trillion for the first time ever, with volumes rising 63% to $5.63 trillion by Dec. 16, according to Dealogic data, easily surpassing the pre-financial-crisis record of $4.42 trillion in 2007.
* Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd has received approval from Taiwan's investment commission to set up a chip manufacturing plant in Japan.
* Alphabet Inc's YouTube began restoring access to Walt Disney Co channels on its platform on Sunday, after the companies reached a distribution agreement to end a two-day blackout.",21,18,1640121351.0,2021-12-21T21:15:51+00:00,t3_rloei1,StockMarket

67,TSM,Some DD on $RRR that I did at 3 am," The stock known as Red Rock Resorts or $RRR appears to be severely undervalued. Their P/E ratio is 33 which may seem high at first glance however this is sub for the entertainment industry(P/E 38 is normal). While a company’s P/E cannot be the only statistic that is taken into consideration while considering a pick, it is a major variable. Another point of interest within $RRR is that large percentages of this company are held by recognizable ETFs from companies such as Vanguard or BlackRock, well-known financial institutions. Not only are they within ETFs made by these companies, but they are also within ETFs of major growth such as Baron Small Cap fund, Vanguard TSM fund, and iShares 2000. Vanguard and Baron also have $RRR in multiple of their ETFs, not just one. This suggests that programs such as “Aladdin” have deemed this as a valuable pick. They have also seen steady growth in revenue, pulling in 18% more revenue this quarter than last, and there has been a consistent rise for the past 8 quarters (except for 1 due to covid). They have also managed to keep their profit in the black(ironic lol) or at least close to it. In the past four months, $RRR has been recommended as either a hold, buy, or strong buy 37 times. It has never been recommended to sell in over four months. There has only been one intuition that has pulled out of this stock and that was Goldman Sachs. While this may change your view of $RRR, remember that BlackRock, Vanguard, and Wells Fargo have chosen to join into the pick or keep their original picks within this company. We have seen. A 16% raise in one week, a 1.5% rise in the past month, and a 114% rise in the past year(despite COVID). This has proven to be a successful stock pick with relatively low volatility and steady growth.",4,1,1639394513.0,2021-12-13T11:21:53+00:00,t3_rfdk77,SmallStreetBets
134,TSM,Why is NVDA so richly valued?,"Hi everyone, I'd like to preface this by saying that I'm a new investor around 3-months and that I'm not dogging anyone's investment decisions. I primarily invest by DCA into ETFs like SPY, QQQ and DIA. I've also decided to branch out by nibbling on individual stocks within the QQQ. I find NVDA interesting and hold a small position from when it was $226/share, I think it has a good business model, a good history of profitability and it has an edge over other chipmakers in the sense that they're the best at graphics technology.

However, I can't understand why people continue buying into NVDA stock at current values where the PE is 95+ NVDA has the potential to grow no doubt, but does it really have the potential to grow at a rate that justifies such a rich valuation today? Or is it just that traders/WSB types are playing games with the stock?

Wouldn't a better investment be to look elsewhere in the semiconductor industry for better deals? I like MU (PE: 17) because RAM and storage is needed universally for pretty much anything that needs a chip, AMAT (PE: 26) because they make equipment for foundries which means if NVDA wins, AMAT wins. Investing in TSM (PE: 31) might be good for similar reasons as AMAT.

I acknowledge that I don't know too much about investing (obviously) and don't even know necessarily much about reading up on fundamentals. I mainly look at PE, PEG and look at the historical gains of the stock and company. I'd just like to have a better understanding.

135,TSM,Discussion on semiconductor industry situation,"The chip shortage has been going on for more than a year now, but most of the semiconductor industry has only started reacting very recently as orders and revenue have been growing massively.

It looks like the chip shortage might soon be over and that the companies have started to adapt to the massive demand.

In my opinion, the market is presenting a lot of investment opportunities and the growth of semiconductor companies all around the world (like Intel, TSM, Qualcomm etc...) has only just started.

84,TSM,Does everyone have the same opinion on when to sell their semiconductor stocks/etfs?,"Everyone and their brother agreed back earlier this year to invest the kitchen sink in semiconductor stocks/etfs. I myself invested as much as I could into SOXX and well as TSM and invested some into NVDA. I am up approx. 16%, 4% and 110% respectively. When is it time to sell you ask? 

In my opinion, for many of these, never. The only one I am considering selling is TSM, and that would have to do with the possibility of a Chinese invasion into Taiwan. SOXX and NVDA will not be sold by me for sure this decade, or probably the one after that. 

Seems to me some on this sub want to sell now because they have made say a nice 20% profit, which beats the market average. ~~If~~ when NVDA goes up another 100% in the next 2 years you will regret it in my honest opinion.",12,37,1638625006.0,2021-12-04T13:36:46+00:00,t3_r8ptp5,investing

Would it be best to just flat out sell it all and work my way back up? Or go stock by stock and try to predict the outlook for each? Any and all unofficial advice would be appreciated. First thing I’d like to do is condense my stock picks as I’m spread across the world with this many. Not quite sure if the majority of the market is down this past month or if it is just the general stocks I have majority of money in atm.

281,TSM,Ford &amp; GM announce new partnership with GlobalFoundries &amp; Qualcomm (but what about Intel?),"Citing the need to strengthen the semiconductor supply chain, [Ford and GFS announced](https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22789413/ford-gm-chip-shortage-globalfoundries-qualcomm-tsmc) a partnership

&gt; “to advance semiconductor manufacturing and technology development within the United States.”

Not to be outdone, [GM announced](https://archive.fo/WlCtt) same day that it will be co-developing chips:

&gt;GM will be working to develop the chips with Qualcomm Inc., STMicroelectronics NV, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Renasas Electronics Corp., ON Semiconductor Corp., NXP Semiconductors NV and Infineon Technologies AG, Reuss said.

I'm curious why these articles made no mention of Intel. If the goal is to strengthen American supply chain, wouldn't Intel be a key part of the plan? Or are these lower technology chips that's not part of Intel's key roadmap?

Also, what do you guys think of these other companies that's not often mentioned here like STMSTMicroelectronics, Renasas, On Semi, NXP, and Infineon? Are they good investments? Is GFS now a buy?",14,10,1637297299.0,2021-11-19T04:48:19+00:00,t3_qx8j2l,stocks
136,TSM,I Analyzed $NVDA So You Don't Have To,"Hello everyone, Today I will be analyzing $NVDA otherwise known as Nvidia. I also have done analysis for other companies as well. Feel free to check them out on my profile! For those that don’t know, Nvidia is a company based in the United States that designs graphics, processing units, and chip units. They reported earnings for Q3 on 11/17. They did good overall reporting revenue of $7.1 billion, which is a 50.1% Increase from the same quarter last year, and beat estimates by $290 Million. They also reported record Data Center revenue of $2.94 Billion, and record Gaming revenue of $3.22 billion. At the time of this post, NVDA is sitting at just about $316.75, gaining over $24 today alone. Some of you are probably looking for the next stock similar to TSLA in terms of growth and are thinking that this might be it, especially after their recent run up. They are up $93.85 in the last month alone!

During the press release, they talked about a lot of great things NVDA has done or is in the process of doing. For example NVDA discussed plans to build something which they call Earth-2, Earth-2 is an AI supercomputer which will be made specifically to predict climate change. Another cool thing they’re doing which I’m sure some of you have heard of is the Omniverse avatar, Omniverse is a technology platform which generates interactive AI avatars. The avatars that are created through this platform will be 3-D. According to NVDA they will be able to see and speak. The avatar will be able to talk about a very wide range of subjects. In the Automotive sector, They released AI technology which allows safe autonomous driving on streets and a computer architecture and sensor set made specifically for self-driving systems. I could go way more in depth on the other great advancements this company is doing but these were my favorite and I think you guys get the point.

Now let's talk about their evaluation…

1. Nvidia beat expectations, and they had pretty strong revenue growth in Q3, however, percentage wise, they did fall short compared to their semiconductor competitors, such as AMD and TSM. Their EBITDA margins are also looking pretty good. However, compared to other competitors in the space, once again they fall short, other companies in the space captured a larger portion of the market. Overall, Nvidia’s multiples are leading more than any other company.
2. Management believes that there is a lot more growth in store. They are growing at a tremendous rate right now. In the earnings call, The CEO of NVDA said that they are finally transitioning into becoming a software company. Nvidia is the dominant leader in creating GPU hardware and now they are also becoming a leader in AI tools and virtualization technology. NVDA wants “Every transaction that goes over the internet to touch a GPU” While also selling the best software available to utilize their GPU’s.
3. Nvidia's current market cap is very substantial. This stock has had extreme hype as of recently, especially because of the anticipation regarding the Omniverse. It’s definitely possible that this company could see great growth over the coming years. Especially since they basically have a monopoly on GPU hardware and also very extensive experience in visualization and AI, but they will be fighting a lot of competition from companies that want in on the action. Furthermore, Uk regulators have been pushing back on Nvidia’s $40 billion acquisition of the chip designer Arm and if this transaction is hindered then it could put a pretty big crater in Nvidia's plans. Overall, I believe their company is very overvalued right now and people should wait for a dip if they want to buy into this company.

I hope you all learned something from my analysis of this company. Thanks for reading everyone!

It feels extremely good and I’m looking forward to what the future holds.

230,TSM,New semiconductor manufacturing plant TSM coming to the US. Is this bullish?,I’ve been investing for about a year but has been mostly is cryptos. I have stocks in some EV companies and retail companies and now trying to expand my portfolio. Semiconductor stocks and tech stocks are on a rise and due to the chip shortage currently going on most likely aren’t going anywhere. I have a couple shares I bought recently in TSM already and currently sitting on about 1k I want to invest. I’m thinking about buying more due to the company starting a new semiconductor plant being built in March. This would open a whole new market for the company and be competition to other semiconductor plants. What are your opinions on this and does this new semiconductor plant have a promising future?,15,21,1636067870.0,2021-11-04T23:17:50+00:00,t3_qmxivt,StockMarket
231,TSM,Do you believe in the Metaverse? ($FB) ($MVRS),"There has been a lot of talk about the metaverse in investment communities as of late – The latest buzzword deemed the next big thing. And now with the Zuckerbergs announcement of Facebook (FB) rebranding to [Meta](https://www.google.com/amp/s/about.fb.com/news/2021/10/facebook-company-is-now-meta/amp/) (MVRS) it seems now it is finally out in the open with the general public. So what exactly is it and does it matter at all?

# What is the metaverse?

The metaverse is thought of as a next generation iteration of the internet. A way for social media to become more immersive and interactive using technologies like virtual reality and augmented reality. In the metaverse you will have virtual spaces that will allow you to communicate, collaborate, work and play across distances in a more engaging way than what we are used to today. In place of a simple graphical element on the GUI of your screen, the people you interact with may instead be represented by virtual avatars, capable of carrying expressive facial motions and hand gestures. Much like the most immersive MMORPG video games of today allows for friends to gather up to collaborate on tasks or trades using voice chat and text, the metaverse will let you do just that, while also reflecting your real-life self inside adaptable virtual worlds built entirely optimized for the occasion or task at hand.

The best examples of metaverse-like experiences we have today, may be in virtual reality social experiences like VRChat or well established online video games like World of Warcraft or Runescape where communities have spent decades building out their characters while engaging with the virtual world’s economies and activities. We also see elements of the metaverse in certain AR experiences like the virtual work spaces offered through Microsoft’s HoloLens for enterprise and similar concepts. World building simulators like Minecraft and Roblox may also offer insight into how virtual spaces can be created. Though I would argue all of these examples fall short of a true realization of the metaverse. However a thought up combination of all these categories might serve as an easy way to grasp the concept.

# Why I think Facebook’s rebranding might work

Now, I think we can all agree that Facebook has more than one reason for rebranding. The company has a terrible reputation following privacy scandals like those of the Cambridge Analytica scandal with millions of users data being collected, stored and eventually breached to be leaked without their consent. Most recently former Facebook employee and product manager Frances Haugen turned whistleblower and disclosed vast amounts of internal documents. These documents along with her statements to the court and press serve to prove that the company has prioritized profiting from spreading hate, misinformation and self harming destructive behaviour among its userbase rather than try prevent it. Last but not least, Facebooks founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg is known and mocked internet-wide for his unfortunate akward personality and stature, resulting in the damaging image of him as a ‘humanoid android AI machine’ or supposed ‘alien lizard overlord’ pretenting to fit in and copy our human traits while he feeds on our personal data.

But on the bright site, there is hope that the rebranding of the company might actually work. In sheer scale, the closest example would be when its Big Tech brother Google reorganized and became a subsidary of parent company Alphabet (GOOGL) in 2015. Yet the corporation is still known today by the general public as Google, named after their most popular service (i.e. Google Search) and even on the investors side of things not many call them by their true name. This may partly be attributed to the fact that they have kept their ticker names (GOOG and GOOGL) unlike Facebook who with their rebranding are changing theirs from FB to MVRS (MetaVeRSe – funny, huh?). But Facebook are looking to rebrand themselves to change public perspective. Their former name will instantly lead you to thinking of them entirely as Facebook, where as they with the new name hope to keep their virtual reality business from Oculus in mind among other. That is in spite of the company also commanding other massively popular services like Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger too. I believe the new name will ease their way into being thought of more generally as a social media provider and virtual communications provider.

What is more interesting are the actions the company are taking to change along with the rebranding. Along with the announcement they also shared that they are working towards lifting the requirement of logging into a private Facebook account to use the Oculus platform. That requirement has long been widely criticized and have made it more difficult for developers and professionals to use the platform than it should be. The company also recently allowed owners of the Oculus Go headset to unlock the device as it reaches end-of-life. A great move that avoids an abandoned product like this one just turning into more e-waste. The move can likely be attributed to the legendary developer and now consulting CTO at Oculus John Carmack.

# Facebook is now a more attractive stock with the metaverse

But is the metaverse just another crazy sillicon valley dream? Is it just another path to occupying our mindspace with blatant product placement and brand deals like showcased in ‘Ready Player One’? Yeah, maybe… It remains to be seen. But to the kind of investor I am, it also makes the Facebook/Meta stock a much more interesting investment oppotunity for someone like me. It solidifies the new direction of the company to me and makes me think of them as more than just a play on social media. It introduces new risk to be sure, tens of billions of dollars to be poured into investing in the metaverse for the company over the next several years. The company expects to spend upwards of $50 billion on this endeavor over just the next three years – with no possible way of knowing yet if it will pan out. It is one of the most significant bets I have seen any big tech company take in a long time and truly sets an entirely new focus for its investors. While their bread and butter, Facebook, Messenger, Instagram &amp; WhatsApp all remain the same for now in both name and purpose, they are no longer the core focus of the company.

I suspect many more conservative Facebook/Meta stockholders might not entirely be on board with this move, but Zuckerberg has such huge leverage and control of this company that this does not matter. They may eventually pull out or might already have, but at the same time, the stock just became much more interesting to investors like me. I like to say that I invest in the future. I work hard to try and understand and grasp new concepts in technology and science at the cutting edge. It gives me an advantage in predicting what might end up as the next big thing. For my biggest conviction stocks like Tesla (TSLA) , Microsoft (MSFT) and TSMC (TSM) I planned to hold for a decade before entering the stock in the first place. As risk decreases and concepts become more clear, if succesful, these type of stocks will rise as they build closer to that future I saw them to be a part of. The metaverse is such a concept, one that I believe in and that I think in some way is inevitable – Not in the way pop culture has laid it out to be, nor exactly how Facebook/Meta envisions it now, but I am certain we will see some version of it play a big part in the future of collaboration, entertainment and social.

This takes the Facebook/Meta stock to the next level for me. No longer are they just a technology company valued at a rare and fairly low P/E for a tech company of around 20. They are now aspiring to become something more – within a field that I understand and have worked with directly. I worked hands-on for 2 years with virtual and augmented reality in my company and know its potential and capabilities right alongside its limitations and downsides. I definitely would have bought shares of the company in the weeks up to this announcement that we all knew was coming, had I not already spent every last dime I have on other ventures like Xiaomi (HK1810) and Tattooed Chef (TTCF) this year. Meta is likely to go into my portfolio at some time in the future and I advocate it a strong buy at current levels if you are interested in the space at all. So no, I unfortunately do not own any stock of the company just yet.

# Critique and misconceptions of the metaverse

Lastly I would like touch on the misconceptions and critiques of the metaverse. I have already seen critique of this move by Facebook saying it will fail. Many can just not see it happen or find the appeal in being someone else or somewhere else virtually. They think it unattractive and clunky in the day to day: And to that I agree. With today’s technology the metaverse is not ready. Very few would carry a VR headset with them on their daily commute etc. Popular media and even the companies trying to enter the space have created a skewed perception of what it will end up being. I cannot tell you exactly how just yet but ultimately the metaverse will integrate into our daily life in a much more seemless way than we can even demostrate right now. Just think of all the ermerging technologies that could all eventual tie into this concept. There is no telling what it might end up being like.

Cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH) could provide a base for the virtual economies of the metaverse and NFTs could allow for cross-platform trading and transfer of in-world collectables like skins and cosmetics that are already lucidiously popular and profitable in the gaming space – especially on mobile. Real time graphics like those provided by Unreal engine &amp; Unity (U) today are ripe for utilization across a broad sector of industries and entertainment beyond just gaming like we see it with Matterport (MTTR) and Snapchat (SNAP). The same can be said for innovative and engaging new ways of driving e-commerce sales through platforms like Sea (SE) are doing with Shopee and Bytedance are with TikTok. The foundations for the metaverse are already being laid.

232,TSM,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, Oct 29, 2021. Please enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, October 29, 2021**

The remarkable rally in equities continued, with stocks jumping despite two of the largest companies, Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN), posting disappointing earnings results in an otherwise solid earnings season. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) both closed the week at record closing levels.

Coming into Q3 earnings season, market participants were worried the persistent supply-chain disruptions and labor market imbalances would hamper corporate profits, so it is very encouraging to see companies holding up better than expected. Recent economic data has also contributed to the bounce in equities.

After suffering its first -5% dip in September, the SPY has come back with a vengeance, advancing more than 7% from the October 4 bottom. In this same time period, the tech-heavy Nasdaq jumped a staggering 10% and the Dow Jones (DIA) gained 5%. Not to toot my own horn too much, but I publicly remained bullish during September volatility and consistently encouraged dip-buying via this recap. Happy to say the strategy, as it has all year, worked great and personally resulted in my most profitable month all year. Hope some of y'all took advantage. Never try to fight market trends, much easier to ride them until you can’t anymore. As I have said for like six months at this point, I think the trend will change once the Fed begins discussing interest rate hikes. When that happens, I’ll reassess my position. Until then I see any and all dips as buying opportunities.

Amazon (AMZN) shares dropped after the e-commerce juggernaut missed third-quarter expectations and forecasted a jump in expenses in the fourth quarter due to supply chain disruptions and rising costs for labor, materials and freight. These factors are expected to generate ""several billion dollars of additional costs"" to Amazon in the current quarter, the company said in its earnings statement. Here are the numbers:

* **Earnings:** $6.12 vs $8.92 per share expected
* **Revenue:** $110.81 billion vs $111.6 billion expected
* Q4 Guidance: Amazon forecast sales between $130 billion and $140 billion
* **Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Prime Subs:** $55.9 billion
* **Net product sales:** $54.9 billion

Apple (AAPL) also disappointed Wall Street in its fiscal first-quarter results, with key iPhone sales missing expectations, with the launch of the iPhone 13 hampered by the global shortage in semiconductors that forced Apple to massively cut down on production, new rules that allow third-party payment systems in the App store, and supply chain issues, which Tim Cook says cost the company more than $6 billion. Key Apple suppliers like Taiwan Semiconductors (TSM), Broadcom (AVGO), and Qualcomm (QCOM) fell on the miss. Here are the numbers:

* **EPS:** $1.24 vs. $1.24 estimated
* **Revenue:** $83.36 billion  vs. $84.85 billion estimated, up 29% year-over-year
* **iPhone revenue:** $38.87 billion vs. $41.51 billion estimated, up 47% year-over-year
* **Services revenue:** $18.28 billion vs. $17.64 billion estimated, up 25.6% year-over-year
* **Other Products revenue:** $8.79 billion vs. $9.33 billion estimated, up 11.5% year-over-year
* **Mac revenue:** $9.18 billion vs. $9.23 billion estimated, up 1.6% year-over-year
* **iPad revenue:** $8.25 billion vs. $7.23 billion estimated, up 21.4% year-over-year

Earlier in the week, a report showed US GDP decelerated to expand at the slowest rate in over one year for the July through September quarter, with the Delta variant and supply-side constraints capping economic activity. GDP rose at a 2.0% annualized rate, missing estimates for the 2.6% pace consensus economists anticipated. However, despite this report and other recent tepid economic data, market participants have remained remarkably resilient and kept buying up any dips.

**Highlights**

* Facebook (FB) announced it will be rebranding under new name “Meta” and the ticker will change to MVRS starting December 1. This is to reflect the company’s emphasis into investing in the metaverse, a 3D shared virtual space accessible via VR.
* Following the post-earning surge, Microsoft (MSFT) unseated Apple (AAPL) as the world’s most valuable company by market cap.
* Tesla (TSLA) shares continued their monster run, closing above $1100 for a new all-time high. Congrats bulls, we getting paid!
* Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) disclosed plans to expand drilling in the top US shale basin in West Texas after posting biggest quarterly profits in years amid elevated energy prices.
* Squid Game Director Hwang Dong-hyuk confirmed there will be a season 2 but said he is “not a priority” right now. Netflix (NFLX) stock was up 2.5% today to reach a new ATH. After lagging other tech companies in the last year or so, Netflix stocks has been on absolute fire following the release of Squid Game, the most popular show ever on the platform. It is reported Netflix made roughly $900 million from the show.
* Shares of Starbucks (SBUX) plummeted 6% after reporting earnings miss amid slowing sales in China.
* The European Commission opened a full-scale investigation into NVIDIA (NVDA) plpanned $54 billion bid for semiconductor designer ARM. Very basically, the problem is that tons of companies, including Apple’s new M1 chip are designed using ARM architecture, other chip companies are worried that NVDA’s takeover could damage competition. In response NVDA has insisted it would maintain ARM as a “tech neutral” supplier.

234,TSM,$TSM - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing | The critical Jenga Block of Semiconductor Manufacturing,"&amp;#x200B;

**Brief Overview of** TSM\*\*:\*\*

Automobiles, computers, phones, IoT, or any device that is digitized requires a semiconductor chip.

TSM manufactures these chips, and is one of the few companies with the strongest moat in the entire semiconductor supply chain. Think of TSM as literally the 1 Jenga block that supports the entire tower.

**Supply Chain Overview:**

* TSMC is a major player in the entire manufacturing process. Notably Backend &amp; Test (Sillicon Wafers).
   * Source: [https://www.semiconductors.org/strengthening-the-global-semiconductor-supply-chain-in-an-uncertain-era/](https://www.semiconductors.org/strengthening-the-global-semiconductor-supply-chain-in-an-uncertain-era/)

**(1) If You Don't Know This Already, TSM (TSMC) is a dominant player in Manufacturing of Semiconductor chips.**

* **Why does TSM have a moat in manufacturing semiconductors?**
   * **Answer: High Barriers to Entry**

1. Manufacturing Knowledge &amp; Quality Assurance
2. Costly PPE to setup plants.

* Costly/Custom Automation within Semiconductor Plants

1. High Switchover Costs with existing Customers.
2. Politically Agnostic Company, meaning their technology is make or break for any country irrespective of their allegiance.

* Source: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb1WDxSoSec&amp;ab\_channel=BBCClick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb1WDxSoSec&amp;ab_channel=BBCClick)

**(2) Air Freight is the preferred Option for Semiconductor Chips amidst tariff/trade wars between U.S &amp; China &amp; Pandemic Disruptions. Surprisingly Strong Synergy To Alleviate Ocean Freight Issues.**

* Synergies across industries between Airlines &amp; Semiconductor Manufacturers expected to be the band aid supply chain issue, as commercial airflights are still recovering from lack luster demand climate caused by the pandemic.
   * ""EVA Airways Corp (長榮航空) and China Airlines Ltd (中華航空), the nation’s two major airlines, reported accelerated revenue growth in the third quarter compared with the previous two quarters, thanks to robust air cargo business.""
      * **Semiconductor Chips. They are flying them left right and centre.**
   * Source: [https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/biz/archives/2021/10/14/2003766054](https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/biz/archives/2021/10/14/2003766054)
* **Why Airfreight is only a band-aid solution in the current supply chain disruptions for semiconductors:**
   * According to Clear Metal, which monitors over 90% of ocean freight, nearly 7% of ocean freight is not making it out of China ports this quarter. Shortages of shipping containers resulted in companies having to pay premiums for shipping and drove demand towards airfreight.
   * In fact, global air-cargo capacity in first quarter of 2021 is [25% less than last year](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/boeing-777-freighters-bring-relief-to-tight-air-cargo-market). The [grounding of the Boeing 777 fleet with Pratt &amp; Whitney engines](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/21/business/faa-boeing-777-engines.html) following the failure of an engine on a plane over Colorado has further exacerbated capacity constraints.

**(3) Forward Looking View**

* For 2022, the global semiconductor market is projected to grow by 10.1 percent to US$ 606 billion, according to some estimates. But this growth is tempered by the long-tail impact of the pandemic on supply and demand in various industries.
* **TSM PPE Investments into U.S, Netherlands, Germany, and Japan**
   * [**https://airfreight.news/articles/full/the-world-is-dangerously-dependent-on-taiwan-for-semiconductors**](https://airfreight.news/articles/full/the-world-is-dangerously-dependent-on-taiwan-for-semiconductors)
      * It also negotiated with TSMC to establish a $12 billion chip fabrication plant in Arizona. South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co. is set to follow, with a $10 billion facility in Austin, Texas.
* **The Rise of Electric Vehicles Will Make Semiconductors Infinitely More Valuable**
   * Take the projections with a grain of salt, but the Y-O-Y increase in EV demand 
   * Source: [https://cleantechnica.com/2020/10/30/forecast-2021-us-ev-sales-to-increase-70-year-over-year/](https://cleantechnica.com/2020/10/30/forecast-2021-us-ev-sales-to-increase-70-year-over-year/)

**The Thesis**

* Go long on TSM with a 3-5 year outlook because supply chain shortage is a persistent problem that won't go away after the Pandemic, and neither will the growing demand for semiconductor chips. 
   * Airfreight will become increasingly attractive synergy in the supply chain. It may even be preferred over ocean freight IF trade wars between China and U.S continue.
   * Without the manufacturing knowledge &amp; PPE required, it is very difficult to replicate TSM's infrastructure for semiconductors.
* TSM is in my estimation undervalued. I set the price target at 155 in the medium term.

45,TSM,HIMX - Simple DD,"It's great to have those 100% gain porns on shit stocks, however sometimes (most of the times), it's nice to have a 30% profit based on fundamentals. Enter HIMAX technologies, a fabless semi company from Taiwan.

**TL;DR:**

* The stock has fallen about 40% from ATH.
* Earnings per share has increased more than the market expected and the fundamentals are still improving.
* The stock trades below its fair value and way below competitors.
* The main reason for the current price is that shorts took over after mid summer and dragged this to the gutters
* The catalysts is the upcoming ER, and shorts don't have the time to cover before then

Below is what I found online from a guy named Tom or Tim, I don't remember. He did the hard works and I'm using it with some additional commentary from yours truly. It's not plagiarism if you give credit, right?

**1. Business environment**Himax (HIMX) develops display drivers for several electronic devices. Unlike semi industry giants like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) it's cost of production is much lower and their expenses are mostly related to engineering and research. Their products are everywhere; TVs, mobile phones, cars, monitors, tablets and cameras. Furthermore, car manufacturers are stopping production because of chip shortage. There's high demand/low supply. This equated to profits in the short and mid term. One major threat to Himax' growth is a supply chain disruption which is, according to the company's Q2 report, not in sight and won't affect its earnings and revenue growth.

**2. Himax' first half year results and Q3 guidance**Himax reported a record quarter with record revenues, earnings and margins despite capacity shortages across all business segments. The management states that it will increase capacities next year compared to 2021. In the second quarter 2021, Himax earned $0.62 per ADS and $1.00 per ADS in the first half. Revenues increased by 81% from last year to $674 million. The company guides $0.63-$0.69 per ADS for the third quarter, but Himax has always beaten its own guidance this year and it is likely that it will beat it again. If we assume $0.7 per ADS for the third and fourth quarter, the 2021 annual earnings per ADS would increase to $2.40 at least.

**3. Balance sheet and valuation**Himax is a financially healthy company with a net debt of $-335 million, $250 million cash on hand and an equity ratio of 53%. With 174.8 million shares outstanding and a share price of $10.6 (as of 10/20/21), the total market cap is $1.85 bn. Net cashflow from operating activities is expected to climb to $300 million and total equity climbed to $614 million. Himax paid a dividend of $0.27 per ADS, but the payout will be significantly higher next year.Check out [https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HIMX](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HIMX) for P/E, margins etc.All in all, the stock is actually very cheap based on its fundamentals.

**4. Risks**Himax is a Taiwan-based company with customers all around the globe. An economic shock, a Chinese military intervention or a severe supply chain disruption could heavily hit the company and are a real threat to its operations and business. However, there are no signs of any operational problems so far. So if you're not expecting WWIII anytime soon, this might not scare you.

**5. Short interest**Short interest in the stock increased recently. This stock has not been shorted this much since I've been following it. Total float is \~150M and short interest is \~24.5M. If you're not good at math, that makes **16.5% short float**. But more importantly, **11 days-to-cover** the short. The ER will be on Nov 4th. There's less than 11 days to ER.

Nvidia Corporation is a visual computing company that designs graphics processing units (GPUs) for gaming and professional markets, as well as system on a chip units (SoCs) for the mobile computing and automotive markets. The GPU segment offers processors, which include GeForce for PC gaming and mainstream PCs; GeForce NOW for cloud-based gaming; Quadro for design professionals working in computer-aided design, video editing, special effects, Tesla for artificial intelligence (AI) utilizing deep learning, accelerated computing, general purpose computing, and much more. NVIDIA sells their products directly to manufacturers and system builders and is one of the leaders in the chip manufacturing industry.  


Quantitative Analysis  
At the time of this writing (10/10/2021), NVDA is trading at $208.31 with a 52 week range of $115.66 - $230.43 and a market cap of $519.11B. In Q2 of their fiscal year 2022, NVDA’s revenue was $6.51 billion, up 68% year over year. NVIDIA’s gaming revenue grew 85% year over year to $3.06 billion. The data center revenue grew 35% year over year to $2.37 billion. Return of equity (ROE: Net Income / Total Equity \*100) of NVDA is 39.25% and net margin (net income / revenue) is 32.33%. The price to earnings (price per share / earnings per share) ratio was 74.61 and the debt to equities ratio (total liabilities / total equity) is 0.83.  


Qualitative Analysis  
Nvidia is a global leader in the growing industry of computer chip manufacturers and supplies major companies such as Amazon, Facebook, and Google. The COVID pandemic brought a massive increase in demand for computer chips and supply simply could not keep up, leading to the ongoing chip shortage around the world. The impact of the chip shortage is particularly evident in the automotive industry, where new car manufacturing has fallen dramatically and prices of both new and used vehicles continue to hit all time highs month after month. Outside of traditional computing usages, Nvidia has a unique opportunity to integrate into the emerging cryptocurrency industry.  In order to mine Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, computers and mining processors need chips similar to what Nvidia creates. There are countless other uses for chips and potentially other uses of chips that have yet to be discovered. With the increasing need and the backing of a large investment from Nancy Pelosi, there’s positive momentum behind one of the global leaders in chip manufacturing.  


Bullish Thesis  
1. Backing of Nancy Pelosi Investment:  Nancy Pelosi’s investment activity has gained a lot of traction and attention, a Twitter account has even been created that now has over 114k followers to track her investments. As mentioned above, Pelosi has a significant investment of $6.5 million in Nvidia. As outlined in the article, Pelosi has had extreme success and retail traders who have shadowed Pelosi have also seen incredible returns. Although this isn’t a bullish point based on the fundamentals of the company, you cannot ignore the success of Pelosi’s investments.  


2. Increasing Demand: There are more and more products in need of chips. With increasing artificial intelligence in  vehicles and chips being placed in everyday products, the need for Nvidia’s products will continue to increase.  


3. Major Suppliers: Nvidia supplies chips to major companies such as Amazon, NIO the automated car manufacturer, Facebook, Google, and Tesla currently use Nvidia’s graphics chips. With major companies using their chips, it provides a safety net for sales of Nvidia’s products.  


Bearish Thesis  
1. Competition: There are a number of other major chip manufacturing companies that offer NVDA stiff competition. Although Nvidia holds a strong position in chip market share, investors should keep a close eye on several other chip manufacturers. Competitors include: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Intel (INTC), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (TSM), and Qualcomm Inc (QCOM).  


2. Short-term supply chain issues for semiconductors: The demand for semiconductor chips skyrocketed during the pandemic, leaving many manufacturers unable to keep up. This has been particularly evident in the automotive market, where the chip shortage is estimated to cost auto makers \~210B dollars. Worse still, some have estimated that the chip shortage could continue into 2022 and even 2023. It’s apparent that chip manufacturing companies have had a hard time scaling production, likely due to a number of supply-chain and other COVID-related issues. With demand likely to remain steady, NVDA will be pressured to scale up production and increase supply - time will tell how successful they are in doing so.  


3. Automakers designing their own chips: The chip shortage has caused new car production - and thus supply and sales - to plummet over the last year. Because of the low supply, both new and used car prices have skyrocketed to record highs. Rather than simply wait for chip manufacturing companies to catch up, some automakers have started to consider designing and manufacturing chips internally. For example, Tesla has already begun making their own chips and one of GM’s China joint ventures announced in September that they would begin designing their own chips. If chip manufacturing companies are unable to meet demand, expect more large companies with R&amp;D funds to follow Tesla and GM.   ",6,10,1635472505.0,2021-10-29T01:55:05+00:00,t3_qi20v7,StockMarket

145,TSM,Stocks to buy this week? Please advise my list,"19yo who has experience investing in index funds but never really bought individual stocks will be attempting to invest into the following companies for long term growth (20-30+ years) over the course of next week.

Stocks I am eyeing right now: 
- Snap
- FB
- GOOGL
- AMZN
- AAPL
- TSM

Recently dipped:
- Snap: I am optimistic that they will find a work around to Apple’s new policies. The 26% dip is just too tempting (someone PLEASE talk me out of this).
- FB: Dropping, and am confident that it will drop more after they release their earnings report tomorrow. Strong company that I know will recover long term.
- Googl: Been growing steadily this whole year until recent Apple policies, optimistic that they will dip after earnings report is released and then bounce back.

Strong stocks:
- Amazon: Been sideways this whole year. Will buy a few shares if they dip below $3.2k, which I hope they will post earnings report.
- AAPL: Again, hoping for a dip after they release their earnings report (historically they’ve seen a dip post earnings report). Will buy once it hits low $140s
- TSM: Recently gaining the interest of large companies such as AMD and invidia. Apple proved to us from M1 and now their M1 Pro/Max chips that TSM keeps up to their word and is able to supply tech giants even in chip shortages. TSM will start to replace intel in the coming years, as evident first by Apple.",30,64,1635118558.0,2021-10-24T23:35:58+00:00,t3_qf41xp,stocks
146,TSM,Should I Buy AAPL Shares,"Hello, I am currently 19yo and I have a surplus of scholarship money that I was hoping to invest. I am a big tech guy and I have been following Apple for a while. Their new 5mm architecture for their chips is absolutely insane, first seen with how crazy their M1 chips did last year. Now, with apple announcing the M1 pro and M1 max, both being insanely powerful and battery efficient, I really want to start investing into apple. I believe that they will take over the laptop market in the coming couple of years.

Today, with AAPL being down since their announcement of the chips, is a good idea to invest around $5,000 or $10,000 into AAPL? I am looking to buy as many shares as I can.

EDIT: Wow this post blew up. Anyways, with earning reports coming later this week, anyone know if AAPL \*historically\* tanks or skyrockets after the earning reports are released? Would like some sources and may hold off until purchasing shares after they're released. Also considering my age, I will just dump all of the money I have rather than DCAing. Also, very stupid of me to say that Apple owns TSM. But the reason why I don't think it's smart to invest into TSM is because the chip designs are still done by Apple, meaning that Apple is still in control for how well the chips manufactured by TSM and how they perform with  ARM and MacOS software. Hardware performance is dependent on software integration -- the very reason why investing into Apple is more reliable than TSM (though yes both are viable options).",232,281,1635018426.0,2021-10-23T19:47:06+00:00,t3_qec1o4,stocks
147,TSM,ASML beats profit estimates but price drops on revenue miss and reduced bookings,"The semiconductor supply-chain constrictions are having the expected effects.

ASML missed topline but beat on the bottom line, then warned that customer bookings are declining 25% QoQ. Revenues are still expected to be up 35% for the year.

 Adjusted profit per share was $4.27, and the stock dropped $33.26 on the day.

This all despite the massive building plans announced by TSM, MU, and INTC this year.

Results and price action should continue to be weird until the transportation industry stops being a major bottleneck.",29,20,1634767984.0,2021-10-20T22:13:04+00:00,t3_qccf1c,stocks

**Market Outlook:**

Stocks are looking to continue their strength today after we saw the strongest day in the market since March. At the moment, the market seems to be forgetting about the potential negative influential factors for the market, as investors ride upbeat earnings data, as well as the favorable jobs report we received yesterday. I still think we'll see some volatility over the next few months, as inflation and supply chain issues will likely cause some problems. For today though, I'm optimistic that the strength will continue. If we completely reject the resistance levels mentioned below, we could see some choppiness. 

SPY is trading just over 444, and looks to test the key resistance level of 445 in today's trading. If we can break through resistance, we should continue to see strength over the next few days. If we struggle to break through resistance today, we could see some choppiness and indecision. DIA is trading a bit under 351. After crossing back over the SMA(50) in yesterday's trading, I'll be looking for it to find support at the 350 level. If it holds up, we could see movement up to 352 or 354 resistance. QQQ is trading just under 368. I'll be watching 370 as resistance, and 365 as support. Gold and silver are each down this morning, while crude oil once again continues the recent strength. Bitcoin is currently trading around 59,300 and is looking to test 60,000 as resistance today. If we break through, we could see new ATH in the (relatively) near future. Crypto-related stocks are up in premarket trading as a result. The big banks are continuing their strength after strong earnings yesterday, and will be worth watching today. Airlines and cruise stocks could see strength if they're able to bounce off their support levels in the next few days. 

Remember to use proper risk management, by making sure you size appropriately for your account and have a plan for every trade you enter (both for taking profits and cutting losses). Happy trading everyone :)",2,2,1634301013.0,2021-10-15T12:30:13+00:00,t3_q8nfmc,StockMarket

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Thursday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/14/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-thursday-oct-14.html)

*****

&gt; # 1. Stock futures rise after S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq broke 3-day losing streaks

&gt; * Dow futures gained nearly 300 points Thursday as investors consider a flood of strong bank and health-care-related earnings as well as upcoming data on wholesale inflation and jobless claims. The 10-year Treasury yield dipped to around 1.53%, one day after minutes from the Federal Reserve’s latest meeting revealed a “gradual tapering process” of bond purchases could begin by mid-November. U.S. oil prices continued to power higher, jumping to more than $81 per barrel. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq on Wednesday broke three-session losing streaks. However, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell for a fourth straight session.

*****

&gt; # 2. Data on wholesale inflation, jobless claims out before the bell

&gt; * The government is set to issue two key economics reports at 8:30 a.m. ET: the September producer price index and initial jobless claims. Economists expect first-time filings for unemployment benefits to drop to 318,000 for the week ended Oct. 9. Headline PPI and core PPI, which excludes the food and energy sectors, are expected to remain high, Thursday’s wholesale inflation comes after Wednesday’s elevated consumer inflation data. With price pressures mounting, the Social Security cost-of-living adjustment next year will be 5.9%, the biggest boost in about 40 years.

*****

&gt; # 3. Banks, health-related companies see shares rise on strong results

&gt; * The pace of earnings season accelerated Thursday, with slew of banks reporting quarterly results before the bell and their shares moving higher in premarket trading.
&gt; * Bank of America was first up, saying third-quarter earnings and revenue beat estimates on strong advisory and asset management results.
&gt; * Morgan Stanley beat estimates with quarterly earnings and revenue on record investment banking and asset management results.
&gt; * Wells Fargo posted a jump in profit in the third quarter, boosted by a release of credit loss reserves. Revenue beat estimates.
&gt; * Citigroup’s quarterly profit and revenue beat expectations on strong trading results.
&gt; * Dow stocks UnitedHealth and Walgreens Boots Alliance also reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue. Those stocks jumped in the premarket.
&gt; * Walgreens administered twice as many Covid vaccines as expected.
&gt; * UnitedHealth raised its full-year outlook.

*****

&gt; # 4. FDA vaccine panel gets ready to consider Moderna, J&amp;J boosters

&gt; * The FDA’s vaccine advisory group meets Thursday to consider a booster for Moderna’s two-shot Covid regimen. FDA scientists on Tuesday declined to take a stance it. The agency’s panel then meets Friday to consider a booster for Johnson &amp; Johnson’s one-dose vaccine and mix-and-match vaccine data. A highly anticipated NIH study, released Wednesday, suggests J&amp;J recipients are better off getting a booster from Pfizer or Moderna. Also on Wednesday, the FDA said data provided by J&amp;J suggests recipients may benefit from an additional dose. A booster of Pfizer’s two-shot vaccine was approved for certain groups of people last month.

*****

&gt; # 5. Foreclosures surge as Covid mortgage bailouts expire

&gt; * Foreclosures are starting to jump as government and private sector programs designed to help homeowners deal with the economic fallout of the Covid pandemic have begun to expire. Mortgage lenders began the foreclosure process on 25,209 properties in the third quarter, a 32% increase from the second quarter. On a year-over-year basis, it’s a 67% rise from the third quarter of 2020, according to Attom, a mortgage data firm. States with the largest number of new foreclosures were California, Texas, Florida, New York and Illinois.

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Thursday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/14/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-thursday-oct-14.html)

*****

&gt; # 1. Stock futures rise after S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq broke 3-day losing streaks

&gt; * Dow futures gained nearly 300 points Thursday as investors consider a flood of strong bank and health-care-related earnings as well as upcoming data on wholesale inflation and jobless claims. The 10-year Treasury yield dipped to around 1.53%, one day after minutes from the Federal Reserve’s latest meeting revealed a “gradual tapering process” of bond purchases could begin by mid-November. U.S. oil prices continued to power higher, jumping to more than $81 per barrel. Bitcoin was up around $58,000. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq on Wednesday broke three-session losing streaks. However, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell for a fourth straight session.

*****

&gt; # 2. Data on wholesale inflation, jobless claims out before the bell

&gt; * The government is set to issue two key economics reports at 8:30 a.m. ET: the September producer price index and initial jobless claims. Economists expect first-time filings for unemployment benefits to drop to 318,000 for the week ended Oct. 9. Headline PPI and core PPI, which excludes the food and energy sectors, are expected to remain high, Thursday’s wholesale inflation comes after Wednesday’s elevated consumer inflation data. With price pressures mounting, the Social Security cost-of-living adjustment next year will be 5.9%, the biggest boost in about 40 years.

*****

&gt; # 3. Banks, health-related companies see shares rise on strong results

&gt; * The pace of earnings season accelerated Thursday, with slew of banks reporting quarterly results before the bell and their shares moving higher in premarket trading.
&gt; * Bank of America was first up, saying third-quarter earnings and revenue beat estimates on strong advisory and asset management results.
&gt; * Morgan Stanley beat estimates with quarterly earnings and revenue on record investment banking and asset management results.
&gt; * Wells Fargo posted a jump in profit in the third quarter, boosted by a release of credit loss reserves. Revenue beat estimates.
&gt; * Citigroup’s quarterly profit and revenue beat expectations on strong trading results.
&gt; * Dow stocks UnitedHealth and Walgreens Boots Alliance also reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue. Those stocks jumped in the premarket.
&gt; * Walgreens administered twice as many Covid vaccines as expected.
&gt; * UnitedHealth raised its full-year outlook.

*****

&gt; # 4. FDA vaccine panel gets ready to consider Moderna, J&amp;J boosters

&gt; * The FDA’s vaccine advisory group meets Thursday to consider a booster for Moderna’s two-shot Covid regimen. FDA scientists on Tuesday declined to take a stance it. The agency’s panel then meets Friday to consider a booster for Johnson &amp; Johnson’s one-dose vaccine and mix-and-match vaccine data. A highly anticipated NIH study, released Wednesday, suggests J&amp;J recipients are better off getting a booster from Pfizer or Moderna. Also on Wednesday, the FDA said data provided by J&amp;J suggests recipients may benefit from an additional dose. A booster of Pfizer’s two-shot vaccine was approved for certain groups of people last month.

*****

&gt; # 5. Foreclosures surge as Covid mortgage bailouts expire

&gt; * Foreclosures are starting to jump as government and private sector programs designed to help homeowners deal with the economic fallout of the Covid pandemic have begun to expire. Mortgage lenders began the foreclosure process on 25,209 properties in the third quarter, a 32% increase from the second quarter. On a year-over-year basis, it’s a 67% rise from the third quarter of 2020, according to Attom, a mortgage data firm. States with the largest number of new foreclosures were California, Texas, Florida, New York and Illinois.

Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&amp;nbsp;

- **Finance stocks tend to move in tandem with one another**. If one bank tanks, it’s likely that they all will tank. If one succeeds, they all tend to succeed. This is extremely useful to us traders, as these banks report across different days. Since four of the seven banks report on Thursday, we can use their results to “predict” the direction of their peers who haven’t reported yet. If the three banks are green after reporting earnings on Thursday, the ones who report Friday will likely follow suit. This can be observed across many quarters.

&amp;nbsp;

- **Collateral plays are your friend!** Those looking to long or short the financial sector should look to do so through $XLF. Given our observation above, if you’re bullish / bearish on an individual ticker, you should be bullish / bearish on the entire sector. As a result, you can look to make a play on XLF instead of the individual ticker that you planned on playing to give yourself move favourable odds and a larger potential return. More information on that [here.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays)

&amp;nbsp;

- **$XLF can be used to hedge your plays.** If you want to long or short and individual bank, but don’t want to blindly do so, you can hedge your position by making the opposite play on $XLF. The options on $XLF are very cheap, and the IV is low, allowing you to efficiently shield your capital in the event of a downturn. There’s also a chance you’ll be able to make a risk free arbitrage play as well given that the options are priced awkwardly, resulting in guaranteed profits. Somebody smarter than me would have to run the numbers though, just to be sure. 

&amp;nbsp;

- **Many of the reporting companies are historically slow movers.** Your best bet at catching a blowout would likely be through $WFC, $BLK, or $C, as they’ve put up larger moves in more recent times. Unless you’re selling options, I would avoid tickers like $JPM or $GS. You’ll get IV crushed and the move won’t be substantial enough to give a healthy enough return for the risk you’re exposing yourself to.

**Last Week –** **SPY** was higher by about 0.6% last week, less than the 1.6% move options were pricing. The SPY had an intraweek low below $428 on Monday which was about the lower end of the Bearish Expected Move before bouncing to finish the week above $437.

**This Week – SPY** options are pricing about a 1.4% move (in either direction) for the upcoming week. With the SPY around **$437** that corresponds to about a $6 move in either direction, with **$431** as a bearish expected move and **$444** as a bullish expected move.

**Implied Volatility** – The VIX ended Friday around 19, down from 21 the week before. It was as high as 24 on Monday and closed Friday near its lows for the week. The VIX is about in line with its historical average entering this week. VIX futures remain upward sloping with January futures just under 24. Options are pricing more volatility towards the end of the year than now.

**Expected Moves for This Week** (via Options AI)

With implied volatility slightly lower, options are pricing smaller market moves this week than they priced last week. Here are the expected moves for the week in the major ETFs, all slightly lower except the DIA which is about the same as last week:

* SPY **1.3%**
* QQQ **1.7%**
* IWM **1.9%**
* DIA **1.5%**

As an example of how the 1.3% expected move translates into strike selections, here’s an Iron Condor with short strikes set at the expected move (based on the close Friday). It would need the ETF to finish between $431 and $443 to see Max Gain:

**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, September 27, 2021**

Stocks finished mixed, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) falling as technology stocks came under pressure by the rising treasury yield while the Dow Jones (DIA) rose, driven higher by strength in financials and energy stocks. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small caps outperformed, closing the day 1.48% higher. Market participants continue to digest the evolving situations in China and a bevy of news coming out of Congress. 

The Evergrande situation has been covered in detail in previous recaps, but there are a few updates. The company announced it was canceling plans to issue shares of its electric vehicle unit on the Shanghai stock exchange and its wealth management arm is facing an inquiry by the local government. 

In other news, a series of power cuts and even blackouts across eastern China, where most of the population lives as demand threatens to outstrip the country’s electrical supply, adding a new threat to the already slowing economy and likely further snarling already disrupted global supply chains ahead of the busy Christmas season. This can already be seen in the sky-high charter rates for container ships, which have risen 10 out of the last 13 days and have more than quadrupled since the beginning of the pandemic.

https://www.tradewindsnews.com/bulkers/capesize-bulker-rates-remain-tight-amid-supply-demand-tension/2-1-1073904

There are several reasons why electricity is in short supply. As more regions in the world reopen from pandemic-induced lockdowns, demand has skyrocketed, forcing already electricity-hungry companies to use more power. Export demand for aluminum, steel, and concrete, three of the most energy-intensive products, has been very strong domestically and abroad. Moreover, as electricity demand rises, it has pushed the price of coal, which is the main way China generates electricity, higher. 

Publicly traded companies, including suppliers for Apple (AAPL) and one to Tesla (TSLA), and Taiwan Semiconductors (TSM) issued statements on Sunday night warning that their factories were among those affected. Apple had no immediate comment, while Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.

In the US, Congress members continue to race in order to pass legislation to fund the government until next year and prevent the government from defaulting and shutting down. This comes amid a backdrop of ongoing debates surrounding the bipartisan $1 trillion infrastructure deal. 

Congress is set to vote tonight on a bill that would extend government funding through December while also raising or suspending the debt limit until the end of next year to prevent the government from defaulting on its debt, which would be disastrous. Unfortunately, something that is fairly routine (the debt ceiling has been raised 80 times since 1960 and three times under President Trump, with the latest suspension in 2019) has become a headline with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell stating that he would oppose raising the debt ceiling. 

McConnell said he would support a clean stop-gap bill in order to avoid a government shutdown said he “will not provide Republican votes for raising the debt limit.” Wednesday of last week, however, McConnell said, “America must never default -- we never have and we never will”, as he then voiced his opposition to a bipartisan increase. 

David Kostin, US Equity Strategist at Goldman Sachs wrote in a note this morning, “Speaker Pelosi and Senate Schumer announced that they will move forward with legislation that ties an extension of government spending authority to a suspension of the debt limit. Our political economist believes that the likelihood of a government shutdown increases the longer Democrats pursue this course. However, we find no major consistent reaction of the S&amp;P 500 to government shutdowns since 1980.”

Here is a very informative article by the Associated Press: [https://apnews.com/article/debt-limit-explained-8c9cbcd3d0c4a8fe989a0110f5159f7c](https://apnews.com/article/debt-limit-explained-8c9cbcd3d0c4a8fe989a0110f5159f7c)

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said yesterday the chamber would vote Thursday on the bipartisan infrastructure deal, which the Senate passed last month. This would be the same day that lawmakers need to come to an agreement to fund the government to avoid a partial shutdown, which would take place Friday at 12:01 a.m. ET if nothing is done. 

**Highlights**

* Along with the news of power constraints in China, analysts at JP Morgan raised estimates for how long it will take customers to get the new iPhone 13, saying it will likely take more than four weeks for the pro models and 2 weeks for the base model.
* XLF, an ETF that tracks the performance of banks in the SPY, vastly outperformed the market today, closing 1.39% higher amid continued strength by financial stocks.  
Facebook (FB) pauses the “Instagram for kids” project after lawmakers and the public voiced valid concerns. 
* Facebook (FB) also said it will invest $50 million to partner with organizations/companies to build the “metaverse”, which is the name for a 3D, interactive, collaborative virtual space. In the latest earnings call Zuckerberg said “It is going to require very significant investment over many years”. I’m sure we will see many more headlines about this in year to come.

151,TSM,Which semiconductor stock would you recommend?,"Hey!
I got into investing a month ago where I transferred all the money I had saved into my account. Since I'm only 13 that was only $1,500 but it's better than nothing I guess. I invested $1000 into NVDA right before earnings so I'm doing pretty great so far.

But what should my next investment be? I was thinking TSM, AMD, ASML and AMAT. Which one would you recommend long term? I'm thinking about investing $200 a month since that is what I earn on my job. My investment strategy was to lump sum $1000 into one of these stocks at a time until I have $1000 in each. Does that sound like a good idea?",102,139,1632322219.0,2021-09-22T14:50:19+00:00,t3_pt959x,stocks

The recent chip shortage has shown that the U.S can't keep up with semiconductor demand. Joe Biden has laid out a $50B subsidy plan for research and development in the semiconductor industry. In the CEO Summit on Semiconductor Supply Chain Resilience, Biden stated that this was a “once in a generation” investment for the future. Semiconductor chips are as essential to our everyday lives as water.

​​4 ways to reduce water consumption in semiconductor manufacturing:

* Transition from wet to dry etching
* Improvements on the efficiency of etching processes used for ultrapure water (UPW) production
* Optimization of tools and procedures for UPW production process
* Reuse of spent rinse waters/wastewater streams

Looking at the 6-month chart for TSM, strong resistance and support lines indicate a resistance around the $125 mark and solid support around the $108 mark. A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108.

**Conclusion**

The biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates. Large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank, are only scratching the surface. TSM’s Green Marketing Strategy does little to address the issue at hand. The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn’t pay out high dividends (\~1.56% annually) but does re-invest that money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden’s $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies. TSM has a positive outlook for the next 3-4 years.

The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn’t pay out dividends but instead uses the money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden’s $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies. TSM has a positive outlook for the next 3-4 years.

12,TSM,[DD] Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM),"**Introduction**

The recent chip shortage has shown that the U.S can't keep up with semiconductor demand. Joe Biden has laid out a $50B subsidy plan for research and development in the semiconductor industry. In the CEO Summit on Semiconductor Supply Chain Resilience, Biden stated that this was a “once in a generation” investment for the future. Semiconductor chips are as essential to our everyday lives as water.

​​4 ways to reduce water consumption in semiconductor manufacturing:

* Transition from wet to dry etching
* Improvements on the efficiency of etching processes used for ultrapure water (UPW) production
* Optimization of tools and procedures for UPW production process
* Reuse of spent rinse waters/wastewater streams

**Technical Analysis**

📷

Looking at the 6-month chart for TSM, strong resistance and support lines indicate a resistance around the $125 mark and solid support around the $108 mark. A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108.

**Conclusion**

The biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates. Large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank, are only scratching the surface. TSM’s Green Marketing Strategy does little to address the issue at hand. The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn’t pay out much in dividends but instead uses the money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden’s $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies. TSM has a positive outlook for the next 3-4 years.

238,TSM,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, September 16, 2021"," 

**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, September 16, 2021**

Stocks finished mixed in a volatile session after getting a boost following the release of new economic data that showed retail sales for the month of August coming in stronger-than-expected, suggesting that consumer spending, which accounts for roughly 70% of US GDP, held up despite rising coronavirus Delta variant concerns. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) and Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, closed the day with a gain of 0.07% and 0.08% respectively. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) fell 0.17% and the Dow Jones (DIA) fell 0.17% and 0.19% down respectively. Jobless claims also came in near a pandemic-era low. 

With the coronavirus Delta variant fanning fears of a slowdown in growth in the US and China, market participants have been carefully weighing incoming economic data. In the US, August retail sales showed an unexpected rise despite the latest surge of coronavirus Delta variant cases. The Commerce Department's August retail sales report showed overall sales rose by 0.7% on the month after a downwardly revised 1.8% drop in July. Consensus economists were looking for a 0.7% drop. 

A few days ago, China’s retail sales report showed a dramatic slowdown in growth as the country battles rising coronavirus cases and seasonal floodings, with output and sales reaching a one-year low. Consumer spending grew 2.5% in the month of August, a sharp deceleration from the 8.5% growth in July and missing estimates of 7% growth. Industrial production rose 5.3% in August from a year earlier, narrowing from an increase of 6.4% in July and marking the weakest pace since July 2020, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Wednesday. Output growth missed the 5.8% increase tipped by analysts.

In a new weekly report by Factset, consensus analysts are still looking for S&amp;P 500 earnings growth of nearly 28% for the third quarter. While a deceleration from the more than 80% growth rate posted in the second quarter of this year, that would still mark the third-highest year-over-year increase in earnings for the index since 2010. Third-quarter earnings reporting season is set to pick up next month. 

**Highlights**

* A host of news coming out of Facebook (FB) after journalists reviewed internal documents from the company. Not going to get into it here, but I recommend you check out was is going on surrounding Facebook.
* Ford Motors (F) said it plans to boost capacity from the F-150 Lightning pickup truck to 80,000 per year thanks to strong demand, adding that the vehicle would be for sale next spring.
* Nvidia’s (NVDA) co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang, who has built the company into the US’ most valuable chip maker, was named as one of Time Magazine’s 100 Most Influential People. I have said this publicly multiple times, but NVDA is my single favorite stock in the entire market.
* Lucid’s (LCID) luxury sedan has received a government certification for a range of 520 miles. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said it’s the longest range EV rated so far. For comparisons, Tesla’s Model S was rated for a range of 405 miles, though it is a lot cheaper. 
* Match Group (MTCH), which operates popular dating app Tinder, said it was working on its own payment system to circumvent Apple and Google following the recent decision by US authorities to allow companies to offer third-party payment solutions within the Google and Apple app stores. 
* Taiwan Semiconductors (TSM) said it aims for net-zero emissions within the next 30 years. 
* Popular chatting platform Discord raised $500 million in a new founding round, bringing the value of the company to an estimated $15 billion. Microsoft (MSFT) originally tried to buy Discord many months ago, but it seems like the company is aiming to go public at some point. 
* **\*\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices.\*\***
* Accenture (ACN) target raised by Deutsche Bank from $310 to $395 at Buy. Stock currently around $342

153,TSM,Which semiconductors company has best long term growth potential?,"I looking to put some money into SemiC sector, but I am having trouble deciding which companies I should go for. I did some analysis for long term investments, and from what I see NVDA, AMD, ASML and AMAT is the way to go. The only thing I am having trouble understanding if high P/E is indicating that stocks are overvalued or that is just very high from recent growth. If i took into account high P/E, that would indicate that AMD and AMAT is the best potential for long growth, while NVDA and ASML should slow down quite a lot.

Also I heard about NVDA ARM deal, which if it should go down soon, that would bone AMD quite bad, and AMD is merging XLNX which should impact AMD quite well by the end of the year.

Im leveraging myself towards AMD, but maybe I misunderstand what I see. Any thoughts?

some options traders think of the ATM/u number as a percent. If so, then GME at the top of the list has a 7.6% chance of being higher than it is now (or higher than the ATM call strike price to be exact), whereas HYG has a .1% chance of being higher than it is now. Remember, these are just for the calls, so it might be that the market places more value on the ATM put than it does on the ATM calls. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Here are the puts:**

73,TSM,"A Possible September Market Wide Pullback + 9 Options Analysis - Journey to $1 Million, Aug 31","# It is the last day of August, and today we need to review the seasonality of the markets going into September so we can be ready for it all. This is the first year that I have started to let data influence much more of my decision making, for better or worse.

## What to expect in September?

The honest answer to this question is, it is anyone's guess. Let's be honest, there has been very little that is considered normal about this year and last. From inflation and tapering to Covid and Afghanistan, what could we possibly expect.

[ VTI, or the total stock market ETF, clearly shows that in the past 10 years, September was the worst month.  ](https://preview.redd.it/oel8rujw7lk71.png?width=473&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=37c9223648070557956bdc70ac3cc684f9916f09)

&amp;#x200B;

[ September for SPY, S&amp;P 500, is tied for the worst month over the past 10 years.  ](https://preview.redd.it/f5v1w5ey7lk71.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e8b1d11b48f74a6ec8de9c1ef7ca8f5a6b69a6e7)

&amp;#x200B;

[ Same with DIA, or the Dow Jones.  ](https://preview.redd.it/b48bzqjz7lk71.png?width=466&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9467df44f70ff9cb620a919e5d5f8f75b14f13f2)

&amp;#x200B;

[ QQQ, or Nasdaq, is tied for the worst month with December. ](https://preview.redd.it/7oc4cxz08lk71.png?width=491&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e28751d5e9cdf04ade3ae10c3e8de482dead23af)

The percentage numbers you are looking at represents what percent chance the stock/ETF has of finishing out that month positive, or with gains. So, over the past 10 years, VTI has a 44% chance of finishing September up, or a 56% chance of falling.

Obviously past performance doesn't indicate future results, but we are in the age of data and analytics, and I find it very interesting to consider this and use it as a lead when we are investing and trading.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Do you remember last September? The Nasdaq fell almost 14&amp;#37; in a three week time span. \(Just imagine what this did to my TQQQ\).  ](https://preview.redd.it/55ag30158lk71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9409b8440115a2c99e9662c68a8262dc4bd5c86d)

There is nothing we can do but prepare for every outcome. This is why I have been taking profits, going smaller than normal, buying up safer positions (SCHD) and other things getting ready for the September dip. Am I selling everything? No. Am I prepared if we do dip? Yes. Keep some cash on hand, ready to buy the dip.

Why do the markets pull back in September/Fall? It is because investors are taking profits from hot summer tech stocks or growth plays that they had and are getting ready for a winter run. The stock market is seasonally cyclical. Money flows out of one sector and into another. That is a sign of a healthy market. As you can imagine some companies do better in the holiday season, leading up to Christmas. AMZN, TGT, WMT, DG? And others don't.

This is why I don't sell everything and run for the hills. Sometimes as investors we need to remember to take profits, and rebalance our portfolios. So from now on, let's do the rebalancing in August.

# Possible Entries

**EBON** is flirting with the 50MA again today and if you aren't already in the position, there is still a good chance. I'd go small and give yourself a month or two out in strike for the $2.50p.

https://preview.redd.it/h6xzvfub8lk71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34da8d7e1267c6321bb56b068cd3b7772cec8015

**AI** is another short term put that I am interested in. It is more or less in the same classification as EBON as far as I am concerned. It looks as if we might get a confirmation candle tomorrow. Keep posted and go small.

https://preview.redd.it/60bu1ntc8lk71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc57f73db5fdecef154bf790c5f9dd339aeda788

**HD, Home Depot,** is one that I have been considering for some time now, but waiting for it to pull back to get better entry and thus justifying a bigger position. **HD** typically does well into the winter months, especially October and November, over the last 10 years according to Trend Spider's seasonality. While we are waiting for it to consolidate back to the 180MA, I think we can snag a short term call off of a VWAP support.

https://preview.redd.it/04e8tqwd8lk71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3821286fb99154b916b0ba0dae8799e1d60e1e62

**TGT** is hanging out around the 50MA, and I picked up December $260 calls today. Last week we got into a position around the 50 which didn't go as planned. Let's see if we can get a better exit this time around. Overall, I like Target going into the holiday months however, it tends to struggle at the end of the summer. I'm going small on this one for now.

https://preview.redd.it/msmjui7p8lk71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16249119a81e229ecacc793616f13f31b18e7b36

**DIS** is forming a long base and looks to me as if it wants to break out. More so it is flat along a big volume shelf. I'm considering a glass bottom around $173 and next time it drops to this level, I'll buy calls toward the EOY.

https://preview.redd.it/hyot5qmq8lk71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2fae85dc4fe74c7fce138ff4ae4a037525199e71

**ABNB** is again on the list of alerts. Although it is playing with the YTD VWAP currently, I'm going to play it safe and give it more room to reach a upper resistance. Although this isn't as strong as the YTD VWAP, I would prefer to let it bounce up a little more.

https://preview.redd.it/wfrpzcnr8lk71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8973fad33b8b30db9dfdb287640b2c34d538770a

**DAL** is one of those that I don't like. In fact, I don't really like any of the airline stocks. They have never been all that profitable, if at all. However, it is hard to ignore below $40. I'm not mortgaging my house for this one, but I believe we can catch a quick bounce.

https://preview.redd.it/1j0zg1ts8lk71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b646dc3973a444bd3534bf3aa990bd49dd097a48

**T** , another Put position, has been doing horribly. I'll be waiting for a bounce either up into the red cloud, or wait longer for it to reach the 50MA. This is not one that I would own long term. I don't like this company. There is nothing good about it. Dividends? Not anymore.

https://preview.redd.it/ehsx1c6u8lk71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e064a6adf631c98ca077d7a36f4fa736702cbd55

**TSM** is one I like long term. We missed our chance a few days ago, so let's see if we can get lucky coming up here.

https://preview.redd.it/eeor4vev8lk71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=816c5a4dac29438f415fce90e4464f5495bcc35f

I want to buy calls again for **F** when it hits 180 again. It looks like that is the new support. Unfortunately last week it blew out of the paralell channel that it had been trading in for over a year. I cannot say that I like the company all that much, but I think there is some upside to still be had with their new electric F-150.

I am long some TSM calls at 130, and I’ve been selling CCs to chip away at the cost basis, but I just realized that it may be smarter to use that premium to offset the cost of rolling the long calls to a lower strike. Not adding more time - that’s too expensive - but improving delta. Improving delta would increase my probability of profit more than a little CC premium.

For example, I can roll from the Jan ‘22 130 strike to the 125 strike for about 1.50, improving the delta from 33 to 41. Then I could sell the Oct 125 call for about 2.05. At this point I have zero risk! (Except for time premium I’ve already lost, although about half of that has been paid for by CCs)

62,TSM,"I scanned over 150 charts this weekend. Here are some good setups I found to BTFD (or sell CSPs): DKNG, SNOW, DPZ, PYPL, TSM","# Last Week’s Review

The SPY and QQQ ended flat last week while IWM and small-caps closed down -1%. The market did not react well to the Fed hinting of a potential taper by the end of 2021 or early 2022. Growth names took a beating, but most of last week’s list performed relatively well being down only 2-3%.

Jackson hole Fed meeting, virtually, is taking place this Friday August 28 and will be a big tell in what’s to happen next for the market. They will discuss economic policies that, as we know, rule over the stock market and dictate where valuations should be. If you are an investor this will be a key event to keep an eye on. Due to the meeting I will be trading light this week, but I’ve still put together a few names on my watch-list down below.

&amp;#x200B;

The market is in a peculiar place. We have:

* Retail sales lower than expected
* China retail sales lower than expected
* China stocks still in hot lava
* Fed saying it’s time to taper
* Inflation being transitory and also maybe not transitory
* Covid news flip-flopping daily between good and bad

&amp;#x200B;

There is more information than the market can even digest, which is a possible factor for this increase in volatility and choppiness.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to eventually get into all the details of how I find stocks to choose from. It’s really nothing fancy like boilinger bands or ichimoku clouds, but rather simple technicals such as support and resistance lines, moving averages, and trend channels.

&amp;#x200B;

There will never be a clear leading indicator of when to buy or sell a stock for max profit. Most of it is knowing about the stock/company and finding a reasonable entry point for it, like we’ve been doing with out “Buy The Dip” charts. Next week I’ll cover some of these charting and technicals a bit more in-depth, but for now I’ll leave you with several questions I ask myself before entering the play.

&amp;#x200B;

* Is the company fundamentally strong? If not, am I playing a bounce or what is my game-plan, aka how long will I hold the position?
* Is the stock in an up-trend? If yes, is it near the top of the channel, or at the lower trend-line and a decent entry?
* Is the stock in a down-trend? Has the stock price settled or bottomed? If yes a base might be forming. If not, am I catching this knife because I think the share price over-reacted to bad news? Is the company still trading at ridiculous PE or P/S? Did the company’s moat get threatened? Has growth slowed?
* Am I trading on stock hype? Has the hype died off and provided a potential entry, AKA my green/orange/red zones? Am I FOMOing into the trade or should I re-visit this stock in 7 days and see if it’s still something I want to buy.

&amp;#x200B;

These are all important questions to ask yourself before you enter any position. Figure out your game-plan and strategy and fine-tune it into something that works for you.

&amp;#x200B;

What do a pizza, gambling, and tech stock have in common? Nothing, but let’s buy the Fing dip.

# The MEME List

**DraftKings (DKNG)**

DKNG had a great run up to $70 earlier this year, but since then it saw a steady decline, with most other growth stocks, back to the $40 level. Looking at the 50 EMA line it was clear that it was in a downtrend, but it just recently crossed back over. I wouldn't say an uptrend is confirmed just yet, but we are almost there. This may prove to be a good entry and I'm willing to take the risk on this fairly risk-averse play.

There is potential it could drop back to $45 level, but IMO this could also be a $75 stock. I see 10-20% downside risk with 50% potential upside and that is a risk-reward I prefer.

&amp;#x200B;

**Snowflake (SNOW)**

The over-hyped IPO of SNOW that shot the stock up to over $400 per share and eventually into a quick reversal back to the high $200's. I added an orange zone box to show where the stock started to bottom out. SNOW has lost most of it’s volatility that surrounded the IPO and since May has been on a SLOW grind back up. SNOW is down 8% over the last 5-trading sessions and is sitting at the 50 EMA (orange line). I'll be looking for a bounce off this line.

Paypal stock dropped recently on earnings after Ebay announced a transition to their own managed payments system. PYPL did post impressive earnings, but had soft guidance for Q4 and the stock tumbled.

Unlike meme stocks PYPL's trends have been steady and consistent. Looking at the chart it just recently dipped below the 50 EMA to potentially form a reversal (but not yet), and is sitting at the 100 EMA where I am looking for a bounce. Should we lose this level I might exit the position as the trend would be confirmed to the downside and potentially $240.

Led by international expansions and strong domestic growth Dominoes pizza has been one of the most out-performing stocks of 2021. Similar to PYPL above it has been on an extremely consistent uptrend. The recent 5% dip has given an entry point and IMO any dip to the 50 EMA can also provide an entry. The stock is also hitting some over-sold indicators which would agree with my bias.

The semi-shortage has been affecting many industries. With how cyclical production can be analysts are nervous about the over-production and over-supply that might eventually hit. However, I expect chip demand to remain robust for the foreseeable future. TSM was trading in a range for almost 6 months and oversold levels are starting to show, but IMO this is a value play. TSM trading at a much lower PE relative to their competitors of NVDA and AMD, and not getting much love. To be able to buy this name back at almost the same price as 9 months ago is a value entry.

75,TSM,"I scanned over 150 charts this weekend. Here are some good setups I found to BTFD (or sell CSPs): DKNG, SNOW, DPZ, PYPL, TSM","# Last Week’s Review

The SPY and QQQ ended flat last week while IWM and small-caps closed down -1%. The market did not react well to the Fed hinting of a potential taper by the end of 2021 or early 2022. Growth names took a beating, but most of last week’s list performed relatively well being down only 2-3%.

Jackson hole Fed meeting, virtually, is taking place this Friday August 28 and will be a big tell in what’s to happen next for the market. They will discuss economic policies that, as we know, rule over the stock market and dictate where valuations should be. If you are an investor this will be a key event to keep an eye on. Due to the meeting I will be trading light this week, but I’ve still put together a few names on my watch-list down below.

&amp;#x200B;

The market is in a peculiar place. We have:

* Retail sales lower than expected
* China retail sales lower than expected
* China stocks still in hot lava
* Fed saying it’s time to taper
* Inflation being transitory and also maybe not transitory
* Covid news flip-flopping daily between good and bad

&amp;#x200B;

There is more information than the market can even digest, which is a possible factor for this increase in volatility and choppiness.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to eventually get into all the details of how I find stocks to choose from. It’s really nothing fancy like boilinger bands or ichimoku clouds, but rather simple technicals such as support and resistance lines, moving averages, and trend channels.

&amp;#x200B;

There will never be a clear leading indicator of when to buy or sell a stock for max profit. Most of it is knowing about the stock/company and finding a reasonable entry point for it, like we’ve been doing with out “Buy The Dip” charts. Next week I’ll cover some of these charting and technicals a bit more in-depth, but for now I’ll leave you with several questions I ask myself before entering the play.

&amp;#x200B;

* Is the company fundamentally strong? If not, am I playing a bounce or what is my game-plan, aka how long will I hold the position?
* Is the stock in an up-trend? If yes, is it near the top of the channel, or at the lower trend-line and a decent entry?
* Is the stock in a down-trend? Has the stock price settled or bottomed? If yes a base might be forming. If not, am I catching this knife because I think the share price over-reacted to bad news? Is the company still trading at ridiculous PE or P/S? Did the company’s moat get threatened? Has growth slowed?
* Am I trading on stock hype? Has the hype died off and provided a potential entry, AKA my green/orange/red zones? Am I FOMOing into the trade or should I re-visit this stock in 7 days and see if it’s still something I want to buy.

&amp;#x200B;

These are all important questions to ask yourself before you enter any position. Figure out your game-plan and strategy and fine-tune it into something that works for you.

&amp;#x200B;

What do a pizza, gambling, and tech stock have in common? Nothing, but let’s buy the Fing dip.

DKNG had a great run up to $70 earlier this year, but since then it saw a steady decline, with most other growth stocks, back to the $40 level. Looking at the 50 EMA line it was clear that it was in a downtrend, but it just recently crossed back over. I wouldn't say an uptrend is confirmed just yet, but we are almost there. This may prove to be a good entry and I'm willing to take the risk on this fairly risk-averse play.

There is potential it could drop back to $45 level, but IMO this could also be a $75 stock. I see 10-20% downside risk with 50% potential upside and that is a risk-reward I prefer.

The over-hyped IPO of SNOW that shot the stock up to over $400 per share and eventually into a quick reversal back to the high $200's. I added an orange zone box to show where the stock started to bottom out. SNOW has lost most of it’s volatility that surrounded the IPO and since May has been on a SLOW grind back up. SNOW is down 8% over the last 5-trading sessions and is sitting at the 50 EMA (orange line). I'll be looking for a bounce off this line.

241,TSM,🧠Micron $MU analysis: bet on chips?,"Today we are analyzing the chipmaker's share, which sank -13% over the past week. How relevant is it to buy a company now and what are the prospects for the business? Let's watch. 

1) 🔥Multipliers:
P/E: 19.21

P/S: 3.11

ROА: 7.38%

ROE: 9.78%

▫️Comment: Multipliers remain at acceptable levels and the stock is one of the cheapest in the entire sector. It is important to note the decline in business profitability in the last 2-3 years. In terms of EV/EBITDA, the company is the least overbought among all AMD $AMD, Nvidia $NVDA and Qualcomm $QCOM peers.

2) 🔥Business structure and fundamentals:

 ▪️We look at financial indicators. Pure Growth stock. Revenues and profits over the past 10 years are impressive, but there is a turning point in 2017-2018, from there stagnation began. Earnings per share (EPS) is at an acceptable level of $3.68. Net profitability fell to 16.2% The company has a low debt burden: the debt/equity ratio is less than 20%. Net debt is negative, but unfortunately it won't last long! The company is now increasing capital expenditures. Also in America is actively being stimulated the semiconductor industry as one of the growth drivers of the entire economy, but there is still not enough capacity to meet demand. Micron's manufacturing inventories were down 8.9% quarter-on-quarter.

 ▪️Now there is an obvious shortage of semiconductors all over the world. Apple $AAPL, Volkswagen $VOW and others cannot increase production without additional components. The decision of Micron to sell one of the factories remains unclear. The deal was valued at $1.5 billion, of which only $900 million was in cash. Intel $INTC and Taiwan Semiconductor $TSM will build 2 plants over several years, expanding market share in the long term. According to Bloomberg forecasts, the chip market will grow by 7-8% yoy. More questions than answers...


 3) 🔥 Company's report

 ▫️Let's go over specific numbers.  Micron's quarterly revenue rose by 38% to $7.42 billion from $5.44 billion. Revenue for 2021 increased by +27.3% to $19.431 billion against $15.38 billion a year earlier. Net income for the first 9 months of fiscal year 2021 was $3.141 billion, an increase of +82.6% over 2020.

 ▫️But the forecasts of the company are much more important. For the forthcoming 4th quarter, the company forecasts earnings per share (EPS) in the range of $2.2-2.4 and revenues of ~$8 billion. In the long term (next 4-5 years) EPS is expected to increase ~ +61% yoy.

 🏆Conclusion by company:

The stock breaks through one by one support levels, the previous one was at around $76.5. The stock is currently trading at $70-71. The cheapest and most promising company in the sector with a huge queue of buyers. And Morgan Stanley $MS decides to revise its goals and forecasts for the company. This is how Wall Street inside information works.
Already on the horizon of several months, the company has excellent prospects, so I keep the shares in the portfolio! I would like to increase the share even if they give a little lower.

🔥What to do if you:

1) ♟Speculator: not your paper!  For you, papers in an uptrend are more suitable. For example Qualcomm, Square $SQ or Nvidia $NVDA.

2) ♟Medium-term investor: be sure to add the company to the watch list and take a closer look at it! As reports are released, there are many opportunities in the marketplace. 

3) ♟Long-term investor: You can put a notification at $60-65 and take a closer look at the stock on the market correction. For now, you should focus on increasing your cash position. I would like to buy Taiwan Semiconductor, but still wait for it below to enter.

If you like my analysis of $MU, press upvote!",9,3,1629136332.0,2021-08-16T17:52:12+00:00,t3_p5l9hm,StockMarket
158,TSM,I've compiled a shortlist of companies that show strong growth potential.,"I've put together a shortlist of all the companies that have experienced significant revenue and net profit growth both in a 4 year time span as well as a 1 year time span, with respect to similar companies in their sector. My theory is that showing consistent results over this time period is indicative of strong fundamentals and will be a good investment over a period of at least one year. You'll see some common companies in here, as well as some not so common ones. But all of these are worth looking into. 

Full disclaimer: I am invested in some of these.

159,TSM,How to invest in US stock markets from a foreign country?,"I am soon going to be 18 and I am from Pakistan. I don't want to invest in Pakistan Stock Exchange even though it is doing good with all that inflow of Chinese investments. I want to invest in visionary companies or you can say blue chips stocks such as AMD, ABNB, TSM, PYPL, TSLA, etc. But I don't know how to invest from here. I know of a few apps such as Robinhood but I have never used it. And also we don't have PayPal here in Pakistan, yet, so I am unsure how will I transfer funds. I had also heard a few things about the IPO of Robinhood like how it has became a meme-stock but I don't know if it affects the purpose of the app or not.

I am still learning a lot of new things daily and I am looking to invest not trade. So, kindly help me out here.
Thank you!",40,34,1628438381.0,2021-08-08T15:59:41+00:00,t3_p0h98p,stocks
77,TSM,13 Options Plays for this Week - Journey to $1 Million is BACK,"# Major US indices pulled back Friday, but not all that much. I believe we are almost at a tipping point for an after summer correction, which will pull down the market across the board, gearing up for a run into the holiday season.  

https://preview.redd.it/1bcspupbkue71.png?width=864&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=02a41e032419f26faad300dd4bb7390095aacc6e

 Only one alert triggered Friday and that was an $**ABNB** put.  After starting on this project, I believe that $**ABNB** is overvalued and doesn't have the sustainability that the current market price implies. Therefore, I've put in two put alerts. Go small.  

https://preview.redd.it/ejhnm9agkue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40397c1f5393200798dd4c6033b186b808f6d782

 A better positions that I would prefer is entering into a bigger put at the YTD VWAP. I have already set an alert for this stronger resistance, but there is no guarantee if and when it will reach it.  

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

#  New and Adjusted Alerts 

 $**HOOD** IPO'd last week and I will be waiting to enter at $10... (Just Kidding) I'm staying away from **Robinhood** for now.  

https://preview.redd.it/j2n60j2pkue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b8caa6b52af8d8929c9c14ba5553cd9a6df1037

&amp;#x200B;

 After a great week with $**TSLA** calls, I've entered in another similar alert as the last two. If **Tesla** pulls back to the 50MA, I'll buy more calls. However, there is a chance that $**TSLA** keeps running next week therefore I am not interested in short term puts.  

https://preview.redd.it/xusig0cqkue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=22d5c663bbebc6b93cb2bf8f818047304dcf42da

&amp;#x200B;

 $**MT** is looking a little bit overbought, and even though I and many other analysts are bullish long term, I believe that this can be a good time to lock in some quick profits. Once it consolidates toward the 50MA, or even the YTD VWAP, we can re-enter with calls.  

https://preview.redd.it/ju2q5ggrkue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd9e8be9ff1955c146f200b161d86d67da242b7a

&amp;#x200B;

 I'm really liking $**CRM** going into August. The 180MA is approaching a large volume shelf that indicates a lot of buying will happen there. More so, the YTD VWAP is lurking at those levels as well. Long term bullish on **Salesforce**, and August is historically one of the best months for the stock. October or November calls, look tempting around the $230 level.  

https://preview.redd.it/udz6h6jskue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07559317d5d5618e74012c3ab7e3ae858b4b86db

&amp;#x200B;

 

$**TSM**, **Taiwan Semiconductor**, is, I believe, an undervalued company that has a fair price of around $130+. This is a great opportunity to pick up calls for November or EOY. September and October are some of the best months for **TSM** according to Trend Spider's Seasonality Chart. At current levels, the 50, 180, and a huge volume shelf are converging. 

https://preview.redd.it/21u9xyiukue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c03a9034effbf1c0594ba5aa34a48a6db2978b4

&amp;#x200B;

 $**AXP** has had an amazing run this year August is one of the better months over the past decade. I believe consumer spending has and will increase and monthly calls or vertical spreads are perfect here.  

https://preview.redd.it/jpgpa2hvkue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c2b50116bebade25f92b68a5e8f9b4437295997

&amp;#x200B;

 **$AAP, Advance Auto Parts**, is still an interesting play for me. Everyone has probably heard by now that used car prices have gone up a lot. If we can get a consolidation around the 50MA, I think it is worth it to buy calls. However, I won't be waiting much longer for this one. I'll give it another week.  

https://preview.redd.it/g655tlewkue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0966c88748b44fd8f3317333e8233339c43c3644

&amp;#x200B;

 $**VRT** also had a good week, up from the 50MA. I'm waiting for a resistance bounce to enter some short term puts.  

https://preview.redd.it/r3kkaddxkue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87d502222fa3701d87bf608c6284efa2dbc8fad2

&amp;#x200B;

 I'm still waiting for **$X, US Steel**, to pull back to the 180ma. As you can see last it just came off a 180ma bounce, but not quite low enough to hit my trigger. I'm a patient man and I'll wait again. This is a good play going into October and November, so we have some time to enter.  

https://preview.redd.it/09oy8sgykue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea114b1ade318baa53487eac738ca13ff3002470

&amp;#x200B;

 **$AI** is to overhyped, and puts at upper resistance will pay significantly in my opinion. I've reupped the time on this alert and will wait for a bounce to enter.  

https://preview.redd.it/snkwzjizkue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=acdd5c9d6fa626471ff21cf572b84a84a18343c7

&amp;#x200B;

 One of my favorite shorts is $**EBON**. Probably by now you know I have personal experience with this company. Sort them into the ground, please. This time the alert is set to trigger at the 50 MA and I'll go into a bigger position.  

https://preview.redd.it/bgr3pqj0lue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20bef00a73ba2a1e68a0f2e2af0930cede9b9a95

&amp;#x200B;

 $**ETSY** is next and the interesting thing about this stock, since its IPO, it has never had a positive October. I will be keeping this in mind when I buy calls at support. September usually is a good month. Getting in and out of this one is most likely the key.  

https://preview.redd.it/whhewch1lue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58fd6d95a96e7fb55d0089c593522f3863b47043

70,TSM,Intel Due Diligence (INTC),"**Introduction**

	How did Intel's co-founder predict the semiconductor chip shortage of 2020-21? Intel has been making some big moves these past few months. CEO Patrick Gelsinger is doing everything from building infrastructure and acquiring companies to signing contracts and securing partnerships. Intel is on track to stay ahead of the competition.  

**Moore's Law**

Moore's Law states three things:

* The number of transistors on a microchip doubles every two years
* Research and development increase the speed and capability of technology
* The growth of microprocessors is exponential.

14,TSM,"Intel to build Qualcomm and Amazon chips, aims to catch foundry rivals by 2025","https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-build-qualcomm-chips-aims-catch-foundry-rivals-by-2025-2021-07-26/

Intel Corp (INTC.O) said on Monday its factories will start building Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) chips and laid out a roadmap to expand its new foundry business to catch rivals such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW) and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) by 2025.

Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) will be another new customer for the foundry chip business, said Intel, which for decades held the lead in technology for manufacturing the smallest, fastest computing chips.

But Intel has lost that lead to TSMC and Samsung, whose manufacturing services have helped Intel's rivals Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O) and Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) produce chips that outperform Intel's. AMD and Nvidia design chips which then are made by the rival chip manufacturers, called foundries.

Intel said on Monday it expects to regain its lead by 2025 and described five sets of chipmaking technologies it will roll out over the next four years.

The most advanced use Intel's first new design in a decade for transistors, the tiny switches that translate to digital ones and zeros. Starting as early as 2025, it will also tap a new generation of machines from the Netherlands' ASML (ASML.AS) that use what is called extreme ultraviolet lithography, which projects chip designs onto silicon somewhat like printing an old-fashioned photograph.

""We're laying out a whole lot of details to The Street to hold us accountable,"" Intel Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger told Reuters in an interview, referring to investors.

Intel also said it will change its naming scheme for chipmaking technology, using names like ""Intel 7"" that align with how TSMC and Samsung market competing technologies.

In the chip world where smaller is better, Intel previously used names that alluded to the size of features in ""nanometers"". But over time the names used by chipmakers became arbitrary marking terms, said Dan Hutcheson, chief executive of VLSIresearch, an independent semiconductor forecasting firm. This, he said, gave the mistaken impression that Intel was less competitive.

Intel's first major customers will be Qualcomm and Amazon. Qualcomm, which dominates chips for mobile phones, will use what Intel is calling its 20A chipmaking process, which will use new transistor technology to help reduce how much power the chip consumes.

Amazon, which is increasingly making its own data center chips for its Amazon Web Services, is not yet using Intel's chipmaking technology but will use Intel's packaging technology, the process of assembling chips and ""chiplets"" or ""tiles"", often stacking them up in so-called 3D formation. Intel excels in this packaging technology, analysts say.

""There have been many, many hours of deep and technical engagement with these first two customers, and many others,"" Gelsinger said.

Intel did not give details how much revenue or manufacturing volume the customer wins would bring, though Gelsinger said during an event announcing the news that the Qualcomm deal involved a ""major mobile platform"" and engaging in a ""deep a strategic manner."" Qualcomm has a long track record of using multiple foundry partners, sometimes even for the same chip.

The biggest question facing Intel is whether it can make good on its technology promises after years of delays under previous Chief Executive Brian Krzanich. In recent weeks, Intel announced the delay of a new data center chip called Sapphire Rapids.

But David Kanter, an analyst with Real World Technologies, said Intel is being more cautious than in the past. The years of delays resulted in part from the ""hubris"" of tackling multiple technical problems in a single generation of technology.

This time, Intel is laying out five generations of technology in four years, tackling smaller sets of problems, and also saying that it might not introduce the new EUV technology with its forthcoming ""Intel 18A"" process if it is not ready.

""Intel is absolutely going to catch up, and be ahead in some dimensions, with TSMC over the next few years,"" Kanter, the analyst, said. ""Intel really does have people who spend all their time looking at how to deploy new materials and technology to juice their performance.""

**Conclusion**

	Meta Materials is going to take the market by surprise. They have a wide diversity of product applications across many industries. Industries include consumer electronics, health and wellness, aerospace automotive, and clean energy. META has changed the manufacturing process of chips. If NanoWeb can be used with any metal, including silicon, then imagine how much you can save on semiconductor chips. Instead of making full silicon discs, companies could use a plastic wafer and print the NanoWeb onto it. META's NanoWeb and holoOPTIC technology is unparalleled to the current competition. Their technology can be produced faster and cheaper than competitors. Their technology is way beyond our current imagination. 

	The semiconductor chip shortage is a sign. Chips are going to be as essential to our everyday lives as water. The shortage showed the U.S that they are behind the curve. The U.S wants to be in the position to not only supply themselves with chips but also export them to other countries. Biden's $50B plan will play a strategic role in controlling chip supply. META will also seek to capitalize on the semiconductor chip boom. The RML tech will change semiconductor chip manufacturing. This is a great long-term investment. Potentially one of the best silicon stocks to buy. Also, check out the \[META homepage\](https://metamaterial.com/). The video up on their homepage goes hard.

First, let me say that if any of you need movement on your short puts, just let me know. It seems all I have to do is WATCH a stock and it starts falling. Just escaped my first Call attempt on SPY with barely my sanity and 75% intact!

Now that things are falling, it seems Option premiums are also falling. This could be a chance for me to make a LEAP, as I am purposely limiting my capital. I know and am learning more how the two markets (stock &amp; options) differ. And in the process of learning more about volatility in general. But is there any reason that I am missing for NOT going for a long call when all the underlyings that I have been watching are falling. 

Examples: I have been wanting to get into X, AA, GM, and of course AAPL, I want to make a true LEAP. So I've been waiting until after earnings. Still trying to determine whether these industrials are a good target for LEAPing. Also see that TSM is dropped like a rock after earnings.",3,10,1626375103.0,2021-07-15T18:51:43+00:00,t3_okza3u,options

**Global Chip War**

	The U.S heavily relies on Asia to produce chips. This is a major issue because instead of building the infrastructure to produce our own chips, we end up spending billions on foreign products. To combat this problem, the Senate has approved a $52B subsidy plan to help semiconductor manufacturers in the U.S to help boost fabrication. However, it will take time to build the infrastructure.

**Management**

	New CEO Cristiano Amon has worked at Qualcomm since 1995. Amon has helped spearhead Qualcomm's 5G strategy and global markets. Before working at Qualcomm, Amon was the CTO of Vésper (wireless operator in Brazil). He also worked for NEC and Velocom. Amon has a good track record. He's been in the industry for a long time while holding multiple leadership roles. Qualcomm might be his biggest leadership role yet. I have no doubt that Cristiano Amon will use his prior knowledge to help guide QCOM into a bright future. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion**

	We've seen tremendous growth across the semiconductor industry over the past two years. The recent chip shortage caused by COVID-19 has been driving QCOM's stock price up. Semiconductor manufactures are having trouble keeping up with consumer demand. It is uncertain when the chip shortage will sort itself out. Some experts have said that it could take several years before supply catches up to demand. A few key takeaways from QCOM's financials are Gross Margin and Price/Book ratio. Gross Margin has remained consistent over the past five years. The average gross margin in the semiconductor industry is 33.76%. QCOM is leading the pack at 60% gross margin. The PB ratio seems a little high to me. QCOM currently has a PB ratio of 21.51. To put that into perspective, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) has a PB ratio of 9.05. While Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has a PB of 17.05. This tells me that QCOM might be overvalued at its current price. Overall, I'd say the company's financials are pretty average in the industry.

79,TSM,"Expected moves. SPCE, TSLA JPM, GS, BAC, WFC and more.","### The Broader Markets

**Last Week –** **SPY** finished last week inside its expected move, up 0.5% vs the 0.7% options were pricing. However, markets moved lower Thursday before a rally to end the week. That move lower briefly took options implied volatility higher.

**This Week – SPY** options are pricing about a **1%** move (in either direction) for the upcoming week. That corresponds to about **$431** as a *bearish consensus* and **$440** as a *bullish consensus*.

**Implied Volatility** – The VIX was slightly higher on the week closing above 16. That was lower than the levels above 20 it saw Thursday morning.

Looking out on the VIX futures curve, December VIX futures are about 22.5. Near-term options remain compressed, while expectations of future volatility (and therefore latter month option prices) are trading higher.

Those looking for near-term hedges will find options prices on the inexpensive side historically, and the least expensive in over a year. Those implementing short premium strategies near term (covered calls, iron condors, credit put/call spreads etc.) will find the premiums (or ranges that they are selling) tighter than they have been in over a year.

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AfPzgjt0mLyhOJUYBEmk4Fd3IpTTyWtkfF12d5L0RBI/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to the link below!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&amp;nbsp;

- **Finance stocks tend to move in tandem with one another**. If one bank tanks, it’s likely that they all will tank. If one succeeds, they all tend to succeed. This is extremely useful to us traders, as these banks report across different days. Since 3 of the 9 banks report on Tuesday, we can use their results to “predict” the direction of their peers who haven’t reported yet. If the three banks are green after reporting earnings on Tuesday, the ones who report Thursday and Friday will likely follow suit. This can be observed across many quarters.

&amp;nbsp;

- **Collateral plays are your friend!** Those looking to long or short the financial sector should look to do so through $XLF. Given our observation above, if you’re bullish / bearish on an individual ticker, you should be bullish / bearish on the entire sector. As a result, you can look to make a play on XLF instead of the individual ticker that you planned on playing to give yourself move favourable odds and a larger potential return. More information on that [here.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays)

&amp;nbsp;

- **Many of the reporting companies are historically slow movers.** Your best bet at catching a blowout would likely be through $WFC, $BLK, or $C, as they’ve put up larger moves in more recent times. Unless you’re selling options, I would avoid tickers like $JPM or $GS. You’ll get IV crushed and the move won’t be substantial enough to give a healthy enough return for the risk you’re exposing yourself to.

162,TSM,A word to new investors: HOLD!,"I’ve been thinking about a post I read here recently. Basically, someone said they started buying stocks six months ago and have been in the red since until finally breaking even this week. As a beginner, it’s so difficult, because you’re excited and you understand the market returns 7-10% per year vs. nothing as cash. So six months later, when your carefully selected stocks stink, it feels bad, man.

I am here to tell you to HOLD your ridiculous stock, and to wrap your head around the idea that a LOT of people have been at this for a very long time. Your stocks are doing badly because people years before you thought the same thing you did: this is a great company! And they doubled, tripled, whatevered their money, and are now selling. This results in you having an unrealized loss or reduced unrealized gain that only becomes real IF YOU SELL. But you don’t have to realize it. Because you haven’t lost money. Your stock has simply lost its SHORT-TERM momentum. 

One of my recent stinkers has been TSM which I bought at the literal top in February. There are lots of stocks like this in tech, renewables, anything ARK. Same with crypto. And all for the same reason – people are cashing out! An analogy would be sitting at a slot machine right after somebody else just hit the jackpot. Bummer in the short term, but it’s still a good machine! Back to TSM, here’s a scenario: Imagine someone buys at the literal top in January 2018 @ $46. Then the stock drops and is stuck below that for 20 months straight until October 2019 when it finally breaks above $46. From there, it hangs out around the low 50s for several months until July 2020 when it nearly TRIPLES in value peaking above $140 in Feb 21. Sure, the pattern mimics what happened in the broader market, but that’s the point. A TSM holder would be up over 250% today. That's sure better than 7-10%.

Right now, my human emotion is thinking “boo-hoo, I am still down now while others are doing well.” But that’s not what matters. For most people, buying individual stocks isn’t a game of making a quick buck. It’s a game of being capable, consciously and financially, to wait it out – sometime for years – for these kinds of gains. This concept was never explained to me, but I think it’s an important lesson for beginners so they don’t sell a good thing and get taken advantage of when they miss the rocket emoji.",1223,337,1625880630.0,2021-07-10T01:30:30+00:00,t3_oh9905,stocks
81,TSM,MU or TSM Leap?,"I've been eyeing a LEAP for either AMD, AMAT, MU or TSM. It seems MU has the lower P/E among these stocks; however I'm not sure which of these is the best buy over the next two years.

It also seems to me that MU, TSM are the only stocks that haven't yet recovered, and consequently seem like better buys. Any merit in that argument?",2,3,1625681137.0,2021-07-07T18:05:37+00:00,t3_ofogpd,options

82,TSM,Anyone else licking their jaws at the semiconductor industry?,"Part of me has never been more confident in the future of the semiconductors. At the same time I am worried Wall Street will be unimpressed with future earnings. A company can make a bazillion dollars in profit but if they say one bad thing then Wall Street throws a fit. 

Regardless of what Wall Street thinks, the future of technology is dependent on semiconductor chips. 

For example Micron (MU). I thought their earnings call was very positive. They had a huge beat on earnings and it sounds like their future is very bright. The CEO made is clear that as cloud storage and EV vehicle usage increase in the coming years it will be very beneficial to Micron. The future of technology relies on cloud storage and the future of transportation is electric and computerized. Its concerning that MU went down over 5% on heavy volume today. Sure looks like a heavy resistance. 

Then you have Nvidia (NVDA). Arguably the industry leader and growing like crazy. They are still waiting on approval on the Arm deal which I would expect to go through. It recently brokeout HUGE. I mean what? Up 21% in one month for a company that size? Thats unreal. 

AMD just recently broke its trading range and on its way to 100. I am concerned that volume was not as big as it was when it broke through but the catalyst of the Xlyinx deal going through should be enough? Its apparent AMD is beating Intel in their sub-sector and Intel is over 100 billion large in market cap. Will AMD be able to continue the breakout? I dont know why they wont be able to. 

TSM has been consolidating for awhile. I cant see any reason it would break to the down side except for a hostile take over of Taiwan by China. Then either its game on between China or the US or the US backs down like they probably will cause, I mean it would be bad business for Apple, Starbucks, Tesla, Costco, and other American companies trying to grow in China. 

How are all of you approaching this situation? If youre not thinking about this industry as a 6 month to 1 year play then idk what I am doing. I got call options on AMD and Mu expiring in October and December and a few in March of next year.",98,121,1625196506.0,2021-07-02T03:28:26+00:00,t3_oc1ua9,options
164,TSM,Thoughts on a PC (gaming) focused portfolio?,"I'm considering adding some of the following (12), but I'm more than willing to trim the list. 
My rationale, especially for the components portion, is that you really can't avoid these companies and maintain general compatibility and quality (AMD vs NVDA, AMD vs INTC, WDC vs STX). 
Brands like corsair and asus certainly charge a premium, but also make high quality, very good looking products. 
The large office/personal computer companies at the end of the list have been branching out into high end (but also high premium) prebuilt gaming pcs and laptops

Components:

* NVDA
* AMD
* INTC
* TSM
* WDC
* STX
* CRSR
* ASUUY

Peripherals

* CRSR
* ASUUY
* LOGI

Prebuilt and Laptops

* ASUUY (ROG, TUF)*
* LNVGY (Legion)*
* DELL (Alienware)
* HPQ (Omen)

I was also thinking about retailers (BBY, NEGG), but I'm not sure I want brick and mortar exposure, at least not with this.
Dividend yield is also pretty negligible thanks to most of the companies not paying at all, or paying very little *ahem* NVIDIA.

*it seems like Lenovo and Asus aren't on US exchanges",8,17,1625154025.0,2021-07-01T15:40:25+00:00,t3_oboffb,stocks
165,TSM,Investing Advice,"So since.last November.I have started to put my savings into stocks. At first I was playing around with lots of penny stocks and having an even number of wins and losses.

But now I feel I would like to invest my money in some company/ETFs that I can really set and forget and maybe put money into some riskier growth areas.

At the moment I have money in Apple, AMD, Microsoft be it very small positions.

Then I have some money in riskier stocks but ones I believe will be go up over the next few years and these are companies I do believe in. I canrlt name them or my post gets deleted.

I can afford to add a few hundred £ each month but want that money to now go into less speculative stocks.

I've been reading on here and have heard people mention stocks like MU, AMAT and TSM.

ATM all my safe stocks are in tech companies but I would like to diversify and that's why I am looking for advice.

89,TSM,Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) may be the World's Most Powerful Company,"**Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM)** may be the world's most powerful company in the post-COVID recovery. This is my first time posting in this sub. Usually, I am not one to make posts in a sub like this, but I felt compelled to speak my mind on this topic and see if others feel the same.

As a preface, I work in accounting (CPA) and enjoy researching market and macroeconomic trends. The semiconductor industry has caught my eye since the beginning of the COVID-19 shutdown. Ever since, I have conducted a good deal of research on the industry. As part of this process I have identified some major players that I believe are worthy investment opportunities for the near/long-term. TSM may be at the top of that list. 

Over the course of my research, Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) has stood out above the rest, in terms of its impact on the global economy. I have read several news articles, analyst reports, and company filings as part of the research process. I believe the best article that explains the immense power of the firm comes from the WSJ. I encourage everyone to read the article, whether you know about TSM or not. It is a great read for new and seasoned investors alike. ([https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-world-relies-on-one-chip-maker-in-taiwan-leaving-everyone-vulnerable-11624075400?mod=article\_relatedinline](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-world-relies-on-one-chip-maker-in-taiwan-leaving-everyone-vulnerable-11624075400?mod=article_relatedinline))

In order to be as brief as possible, I have listed some highlights that lured me onto the conclusion that TSM will prove to be one of the world's most powerful and influential businesses, especially during the COVID-19 recovery.

&amp;#x200B;

* TSM is the largest ""fab"" shop by a long shot (They produce 92% of sophisticated chips &amp; 60% of less-sophisticated chips worldwide)
* Enormous cost of capital requirements make it nearly impossible for new entrants to join the industry and eat away at market share
* The global chip shortage has left government's scrambling for reliance on fabs which has lead to large sums of funding
* TSM has enormous production capacity and technical know-how compared with its peers
* TSM serves as a political barrier for the nation of Taiwan (i.e. if China tries to disrupt the Taiwanese political structure, this will lead to shutdowns in TSM manufacturing, thus circumventing the Chinese economy which heavily relies on chips)
* Operational efficiencies - AKA:  Economies of scale (Do I even have to say anymore here?)
* Low levels of debt in comparison to its competitors
* Strong sales growth expected to continue for the next 3 - 5 years to catch up with demand for products that currently have shortages (i.e. Automotive industry)
* TSM is currently at a favorable valuation price compared with its peers (at least in my opinion)
* New technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), the internet of things (IoT), high performance computing (HPC), autonomous, and robotics, will increase reliance on TSM
* TSM will be able to pass increasing material costs onto its customers, due to the heightened demand for chips (Further reading if you would like: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/chip-shortages-are-starting-to-hit-consumers-higher-prices-are-likely-11624276801?page=1](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chip-shortages-are-starting-to-hit-consumers-higher-prices-are-likely-11624276801?page=1))

&amp;#x200B;

I hope the above points helped communicate my thesis in a clear manner. I truly believe that TSM will continue to be regarded as one of the most powerful companies in the world for the foreseeable future, especially during the global COVID-19 recovery. I encourage anyone to discuss this topic further in order to keep the conversation going. What are your thoughts on my TSM stance? Are there other companies that you believe will be ultra-powerful in a post-COVID world? Please comment! I look forward to reading.",882,258,1624505505.0,2021-06-24T03:31:45+00:00,t3_o6so6g,investing
282,TSM,Why TSMC isn't the most valuable company on Earth?,"It just doesn't make sense for any other company to be #1. When you think about it, the economy of modern civilization is dependent on TSMC and chips only they have the tech and knowhow to make. If Apple ceased to exist it would create a gap in consumer electronics and computer market but that gap would be filled in what, 6 months, a year maybe? But if Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturer closed it's door tomorrow, the world would go into a decade long recession because new chips from other factories would be inferior to TSMC made. Car makers would have to halt production or make worse than previous generation vehicles, tech would stop improving. It's known that China is throwing money at this problem but it will take them years of poaching workforce from Taiwan and perfecting the tech to become what TSMC is today!

When you think about it, China could start WW3 just by invading Taiwan- it's too important for USA and probably worth to start a war because of it.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel that I overlooked something but it makes sense- the device you're typing a response to this probably has a chip made by TSMC!",93,65,1624478851.0,2021-06-23T20:07:31+00:00,t3_o6kv6t,stocks

166,TSM,Exposure to semiconductors suggestions,"I am looking to gain additional exposure to semiconductors (beyond what I already have with FSKAX, VTIAX and VXUS) and am looking to get feedback or suggestions on the best way to go about doing this. This is in a taxable account. My first thought was to buy SMH as TSM and NVDA are the two largest holdings. However, it lacks any AAPL and MSFT. Would the best choice be to buy SMH and also both AAPL and MSFT? Or, would it be best to buy AMD, NVDA, TSM, AMAT, TXN, AAPL and MSFT individually?",8,20,1623815398.0,2021-06-16T03:49:58+00:00,t3_o0w0dz,stocks
47,TSM,$AMAT DD and why semi-conductor stocks are a great play right now,"As usual for me, I took some of my adderall prescription and it drove me to write a DD on my most watched stocks at the moment.

Applied Matterials Inc ($AMAT) is a large-cap stock, and I base my play upon it's high quality and strong momentum; as well as confidence in semi-conductor stocks. AMAT provides manufacturing equipment, services and software to the semiconductor, display and related industries.

Applied Materials is the leading producer of equipment and materials for producing microchips, TV's (OLED's/LCD's), and solar panels. They also have their services business which offers manufacturing consulting and automation software. They are based in California, but have factories around the world, with Asian customers accounting for 80% of it's revenue.

To summarise:

- Semi-conductor systems make 60% of revenue, this is for equipment used to manufacture semiconductor devices such as microprocessors and memory.

- Applied global services provide a quarter of revenue. This is for integrated solutions to optimise equipment, performance and productivity,

- And the display markets account for 10% of it's revenue. Providing products for manufacturing LCD's and OLED displays.

- It's customers include Apple, HP and Dell.

With the current silicon shortage, I expect the stock to surge further when this shortage slows down.

- AMAT has been stair stepping higher in the recent bull trend, as a leader in one of the stronger industry groups in tech (semiconductors), I believe it among other semi-conductor stocks are a great buy for a long right now.

- AMAT's 5-year return on Capital Employed is 25.1%, which is a strong indicator that it has the power to grow profitably. AMAT's share price has had a 72.1% return relative to the market over the past 12 months.

- Furthermore, it's earnings outlook is improving. Analysts are still raising their earnings estimates for the company. For the year, the stock currently has an earnings estimate of $6.53 per share, up 56.59% from a year ago.

- AMAT is testing the 10 week line on the weekly chart, after declining recently. This has formed a handle, and if you rebound from here to get above the handle, there could be a breakout.

- As Nvidia recently broke out we could see other semiconductor stocks such as TSM, AMAT, LCRX, and ASML following this pattern.

- ASML is also in the buy range after finding support at the 10-week line.

Why semi-conductor stocks are a good play: 
- The Innovator IBD Breakout Oppurtunities Index (BOUT) jumped 152% from March 2020 lows before pulling back in February. This ETF is now integrating leading components manufacturers such as DELL, ZBRA, AMAT, LRCX, UCTT, and TER.

Jim Cramer himself is now looking at AMAT, TSM and AMD.

""Cramer recently said that if investors think chips are truly in short supply and we need capital equipment, then the company they most need is Lam Research (LRCX), other than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM)""

""Jim Cramer recently named chip equipment major Applied Materials (AMAT), as one of the stocks that got away.

He called out the bull market in semiconductor equipment. We need to make more chips, he said, and companies like Applied Materials can make that happen.

The semiconductor equipment major reported mixed fiscal-second-quarter earnings and received a number of positive reviews and price-target upgrades from Wall Street analysts.""

Anyway, aside from Cramer there are many other reasons to own semi-conductor stocks.

One of my primary reasons is the growth in data centre demand. This was why I bought NVDA calls at $620, aside from the stock-split. AMD is also bringing out new data-centre GPUs.

- There has been a huge growth in demand for data centre equipment, due to the rise in work-from-home driving data centre's to increase their cloud-storage capacities. This has fuelled demand for data-centre chips from data centre operators.

- The data centre market is expected to grow to $519.34 billion during 2021-2025, driven by the growing clout of cloud services and digitization. Further, increase in adoption of multi-cloud and network upgrade to support 5G is fueling growth.

- New semiconductor manufacturing processes from 10nm, 7nm, to 5nm and 3nm has opened new business avenues.

- 5G deployment is spuring further sector growth.

- VR and AR devices, gaming, wearables and drones, have grown in use due to Coronavirus - hence leading to a increase in usage of online services globablly.

- Improvements in DRAM and NAND pricing are fueling semi-conductor stocks catering to the memory market.

- AMD, and TSM delivered good performance in the first quarter driven by data centre demand.

I think my adderall has worn off now, but I will update with a part 2 later on. I'm going to open a position in TSMC, AMAT, LCRX, and ASML today. I will look at AMD also.",17,17,1623332540.0,2021-06-10T13:42:20+00:00,t3_nwnysp,wallstreetbets
167,TSM,Suggestions for my portfolio,"Hello everyone, I recently started my first job a few months ago and have started getting into investing. I am personally interested in the tech industry so that's where I invested most of my money. But I realized that my portfolio is not diverse as I'd like it to be so I was hoping to get some suggestions from y'all on how to diversify it or just how to improve my portfolio in general. Most of my money are in ETFs because I'm not confident enough about my knowledge to invest in individual stocks yet and I'm hoping this post will change that. I saw a similar post here today and it received really helpful feedback so I'm hoping to get some help too. These are my positions (total worth 5k):

1. VOO (31.5% of portfolio, +1.79%)
2. ARKK (28.5%, +6.34%)
3. VGT (22.42%, +4.15%)
4. MSFT (5.13%, +2.26%)
5. AMD (5.02%, -1.33%)
6. TDOC (3.16%, -1.92%)

Stocks I'm interested in but don't know if I should pull the trigger or not: TSM, PLL, ABNB, ASML, ETSY, CHGG, CRSR. 

Any suggestion would be awesome, thanks!",13,10,1623312974.0,2021-06-10T08:16:14+00:00,t3_nwidip,stocks
243,TSM,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, June 4, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, June 4, 2021**

Stocks rose today as investors digested the May Job Report, which showed non-farm payrolls rise by less than expected for the second straight month. Market participants seem to be interpreting the back-to-back miss in job gains for two consecutive months as meaning the Federal Reserve will keep the current accommodative monetary policy in place until the labor market shows robust signs of improvement.

The Labor Department’s May Job Report showed the economy gained 559,000 non-farm payrolls, a substantial increase compared to April but still below estimates of 650,000. For months, the Federal Reserve has consistently reiterated it wants to see a “string” of strong labor reports, like the one in March, before policy adjustments are seriously considered. This is why technology and growth stocks, which would be affected the most by potential adjustments in policy, outperformed today. Former Chase Chief Economist Anthony Chan said, “What I see here is somewhat of a ‘goldilocks’ overall economy. I see that employment is increasing. With regard to the reason why the market is excited, it's because it's telling us that the economy is not blistering hot, that it's actually going to be opening up pretty gradually. I think that's important."" 

Recent economic data has been good overall. A stronger-than-expected ADP private payrolls report and weekly jobless claims report released Thursday each underscored firming rehiring trends across the economy, with a smaller share of individuals becoming newly unemployed for pandemic-related reasons. Another wave of vaccinations has taken place, reopenings have picked up, and businesses have been scrambling to bring back workers to keep pace with surging demand. 

Federal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams said that the economy was ""still quite a ways off from maintaining the substantial further progress we’re really looking for in terms of adjustments to our asset purchase program.""

244,TSM,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, June 3, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, June 3, 2021**

Stocks dipped today, with the three major indexes pulling back after a recent run of gains in the last two weeks. Seems like after the recent run of gains we are seeing some profit taking across the board. I see no real reason for the dip given that new economic data released today was overwhelmingly positive. Looking ahead, market participants are waiting for May’s Job Report slated to be released tomorrow.

Amid negotiations with Republican lawmakers regarding the proposed infrastructure bill, today, the Washington Post reported that President Biden was open to reconsidering his previous proposal to raise the corporate tax rate to from 21% to 28%. This proposed increase has been one of the main sticking points during negotiations. Now it is reported Biden would recommend a minimum corporate tax rate of 15%. 

We got two pieces of good news in the labor market today. On one hand, according to a report by payroll processing firm ADP, the private sector added 978,000 jobs in May, well ahead of consensus estimates of 650,000. On the other hand, according to the Labor Department’s Weekly Jobless claim report, showed 385,000 new jobless claims, roughly in-line with 387,000 estimate and a fresh pandemic low, a great sign that the labor market is improving as the economy continues to recover. 

These reports set the stage for the official May Jobs Report set to be released tomorrow by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which will be critical in determining the pace of economic recovery and whether the Federal Reserve will consider tapering monetary support in the near future. The April Job Report was extremely disappointing, showing only 266,000 jobs added compared to the 1 million expected, and marking a sharp deceleration compared to March. 

**Highlights**

* Extremely volatile trading continued in AMC, which saw it’s stock price recover from roughly 30% down to more than 10% up and only to dip again towards the end of the day. Other “meme stocks” traded in similar patterns after rocketing up in the last few days. 
* AMC issues and additional 11 million shares today, with the company taking advantage of its surging stock price. 
* Boeing Co Chief Executive Dave Calhoun on Thursday pointed to potential ""supply constraints"" beginning in the summer after a ""more robust"" recovery from the coronavirus-related downturn than he had imagined, another sign that demand is catching up in many industries faster than supply as the economy roars back from the coronavirus-induced recession.
* Twitter (TWTR) on Thursday said it will roll out a new subscription product initially in Australia and Canada called Twitter Blue, which will let paying users edit their tweets before posting and change the color theme of their app. Twitter has recently been making big pushes trying to raise revenue
* Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) is moving ahead with $12 billion plans to build a new semiconductor factory in Arizona.

Intel (INTC) also recently showed plans to also build new factories in Arizona. 
* Jack Ma's Ant Group has been approved to run a consumer finance company, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission [said Thursday.](https://www.cbirc.gov.cn/branch/chongqing/view/pages/common/ItemDetail.html?docId=987949&amp;itemId=2005&amp;generaltype=0) This is one of the first step of Ant's forced restructuring after China pulled the plug on its $35 billion IPO in October 2020.

These reports set the stage for the official May Jobs Report set to be released tomorrow by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which will be critical in determining the pace of economic recovery and whether the Federal Reserve will consider tapering monetary support in the near future. The April Job Report was extremely disappointing, showing only 266,000 jobs added compared to the 1 million expected, and marking a sharp deceleration compared to March. 

**Highlights**

* Extremely volatile trading continued in AMC, which saw it’s stock price recover from roughly 30% down to more than 10% up and only to dip again towards the end of the day. Other “meme stocks” traded in similar patterns after rocketing up in the last few days. 
* AMC issues and additional 11 million shares today, with the company taking advantage of its surging stock price. 
* Boeing Co Chief Executive Dave Calhoun on Thursday pointed to potential ""supply constraints"" beginning in the summer after a ""more robust"" recovery from the coronavirus-related downturn than he had imagined, another sign that demand is catching up in many industries faster than supply as the economy roars back from the coronavirus-induced recession.
* Twitter (TWTR) on Thursday said it will roll out a new subscription product initially in Australia and Canada called Twitter Blue, which will let paying users edit their tweets before posting and change the color theme of their app. Twitter has recently been making big pushes trying to raise revenue
* Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) is moving ahead with $12 billion plans to build a new semiconductor factory in Arizona. The US government has been aggressively pursuing semiconductor companies for investments, looking to secure its supply of semiconductors. Intel (INTC) also recently showed plans to also build new factories in Arizona. 
* Jack Ma's Ant Group has been approved to run a consumer finance company, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission said Thursday. This is one of the first step of Ant's forced restructuring after China pulled the plug on its $35 billion IPO in October 2020. It also means the company will be regulated more like a traditional financial entity, giving authorities more oversight over company operations

245,TSM,"The global chip shortage and how I'll be taking advantage of the semi's dip: NVDA, AMD, AMAT, TSM","The global semi-conductor shortage, aka chip shortage, has been crippling many industries. Demand for chips is continuing to outstrip supply and the car industry is longer the only one feeling the pain. Many auto-makers are actually limiting the amount of cars produced in 2021, including Ford recently who announced they will be canceling weeks worth of production of the F-150.

**Overview**

There are a few factors at play giving analysts the impression that this shortage may last until early 2022. There’s a few KEY points that come to mind:

* Most chips are produced overseas: Covid-related delays in shipping ports have effected supply coming into the United States.
* China has been stock-piling chips: Chinese businesses have bought an absurd amount of chip-producing equipment (roughly $32 billion) in an effort to protect themselves from further US sanctions.
* Demand for electronic products have soared.
* Often over-looked, consumers don’t realize the amount of chips it takes to build cars in 2021. The trend is continuing in the same direction as many analysts expect the automative industry to begin predominantly developing cars with network connectivity.

This leaves an opportunity for those willing to look past the hardship some of these companies are experiencing of being unable to meet demand. The semi-conductor industry is expected to grow at CAGR of roughly \~9% over the next 7-8 years. I see this as a relatively conservative number and it is my opinion that we are heading into a super-cycle of chip upgrades, processing power, and memory devices. Here are a few reasons:

1. We are already seeing noticeable shift in demand and the way consumers are interacting in a new digital world.
2. These electronics are becoming faster and more powerful, which simply requires a larger quantity &amp; quality of chips.
3. More and more devices rely on connectivity and the car industry is now making it’s way onto a similar path.
4. Following Nvidia’s earnings call we are seeing a large rise in trends for AI and machine-learning which is leading to increased demand for the required components.
5. The rise of crypto mining will also play a role in the increased demand.

**The Players**

Many of the chip-related plays have already seen convincing growth over the last 12 months. However, several names have recently followed the markets to the downside and currently pose a potential good entry point. This secular trend in semi-conductor demand over the next several years is here to stay.

My semis watchlist is holding some familiar names: Applied Materials (AMAT), ASML Holdings (ASML), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Nvidia (NVDA), Intel (INTC), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Qualcomm (QCOM), and Taiwan Semiconductors (TSM).

The ones that make my shortlist are the following: NVDA, AMD, TSM, and AMAT. Here’s a look at the 2-year chart for the 4 tickers mentioned above. 

https://preview.redd.it/xr0kge6rq2371.png?width=2380&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4beece1276b8c383ed5a2c0cca07bf40f42da11

&amp;#x200B;

It is clear the secular trend in computer chips and processors have contributed greatly to the growth of these companies. Let’s take a look at a shorter time-frame. Here’s the 3-month chart for the same list of tickers. 

https://preview.redd.it/pip83wxqq2371.png?width=2388&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b353b714f1958233646a57ee5680bf2385ee2a3d

&amp;#x200B;

Looking at it from another angle we see AMD and TSM have been lagging behind the performance of AMAT and NVDA, who are on a nearly identical path. TSM is a leading manufacturer of chips and actually supplies most of AMD’s chips. They are based in Taiwan and there have been some concerns over the potential invasion of China. Setting those concerns aside these companies may still experience strong growth. My plays right now are in AMD and TSM and I will feel comfortable adding to any of the names I mentioned in this article if the right entry point shows itself.

**Final Thoughts**

I would love to say here’s why “x” company is in a better financial position than company “y”, but in this case I believe the high demand for semiconductors will benefit most names participating in this industry. Of course, not every company is made equal so please do your own research before investing in any stocks. In my opinion, this industry is in an upward secular trend and demand remains in-tact, providing tailwinds to the participants.

Keep an eye on earnings reports and financial data of companies that BUY these products. Look at phone, tablet, computer manufacturers (Apple), cloud server providers, Google server expansion (also server chip REPLACEMENT rates, which is a thing), and AI/Machine learning projects (autonomous driving, video analysis, big-data processors). It may be years before the growth slows in this industry and these players will stand to largely benefit.",31,15,1622736430.0,2021-06-03T16:07:10+00:00,t3_nrh2hj,StockMarket

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\* If you aren't in TSM ( ***Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing***) you hate money. Here are some reasons you should look into this stock and buy it before it is too late. \*\*\*

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Economics 101, Supply and Demand.**

* TSM is the largest semiconductor manufacturer in the world
* THERE IS A WORLDWIDE SEMICONDUCTOR SHORTAGE
* Let me emphasize this point. THERE IS A WORLDWIDE SEMICONDUCTOR SHORTAGE

As many of you know, there is a worldwide semiconductor shortage (yes I said it again). These semiconductors are vital components in every electronic we use today. Without these semiconductors, things like smartphones, automobiles, video game consoles, etc. Would not be able to function.

(Read the following if you want to see why these semiconductors are so vital...or just completely trust me, that's fine too)

***\*ALL COMPUTERS NEEDS SEMICONDUCTORS TO FUNCTION\****

Semiconductors are used primarily in electronic devices, including chips, diodes, transistors, and integrated circuits. According to Goldman Sachs 169 industries rely on semiconductors. Anything that is computerized or uses radio waves depends on semiconductors. Your phone is a computer, your car is a computer, your video game consoles are computers, your amazon firestick is a computer, every aspect of your life is dependent on these semiconductors.

TSM PRODUCES THESE CHIPS FOR THE FOLLWOING COMPANIES AND MANY MORE:
-Apple
-Toyota
-NVIDIA
-AMD
-SO MANY MORE

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Do you believe the future of automobiles are powered by electric? Not without semiconductors.

**Semiconductors in Automobiles**

1. **Vehicle electrification –** Semiconductors have made it possible to replace manual systems with electrical systems. Electrification of key systems provides benefits such as increased vehicle efficiency, reductions in carbon emissions, and minimizing oil dependency.
2. **Safety and driver assistance –** The increasing need for better safety and driver assistance systems in cars has provided a niche for semiconductors. Intelligent functions such as backup cameras, blind-spot detection, adaptive cruise control, lane change assist, airbag deployment, and emergency braking systems are all made possible through the integration of semiconductor technologies.
3. **Connectivity –** Cars are increasingly incorporating technology that improves their connectivity. New vehicles on the market include ever-more sophisticated telematics (long-distance data transmission) and infotainment capabilities which feed drivers information on factors such as road closures, collision avoidance, and even free parking spaces at their destination. On-board computers which handle this information have to process millions of lines of code every second. Semiconductors allow cars to stay connected in real-time.

Semiconductors are key to the future of the electric vehicle (EV) industry as they help to control the powertrain and battery. Semiconductors are also used in the variety of touchscreens that are installed in the driver’s dash and in the back of passenger seats.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**FINANCIALS/NEWS**

* Financially, the company has reported its third straight quarter of record sales in its first-quarter earnings report back in April.
* Its revenue came in 25.4% higher year-over-year to 12.9 billion.
* The stock has more than doubled in price over the past year
* Japan’s government recently announced that it wants TSM and Sony to invest $9.2 billion to build the country’s first 20-nanometer chip plant.
* Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) said on Friday (5/21/2021) that it has increased its 2021 output for a key component for automotive semiconductors by 60% compared with last year, amid a global chip shortage.

These are just a couple of things. If This has caught your eye please research TSM on your own and you can find more great news and financial statements...or don't, you've made it this far, might as well go all in.

246,TSM,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, May 14, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, May 14, 2021**

Stocks continued yesterday’s momentum, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closing 1.51% up, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 2.21% up, while the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 1.11% up. The price action this week has been nothing short of remarkable, with the market selling off in the first three days of the week before recovering Thursday and Friday. In my view, this week was like a battle between the inflationary fears spooking market participants that the Fed will tighten rates sooner than expected while the April Job report, which greatly missed estimates and marked a sharp deceleration in job growth compared to March bolstered confidence in the Fed’s commitment to maintaining monetary policy accommodative until it sees a “string” of strong labor reports like the one in March. While I said that I thought the initial sell-off was an overreaction (and it seems to be that way judging from the last two days), short-term volatility may continue going into next week, too early to tell if the market is beginning a new uptrend. 

On Wednesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the consumer price index (CPI), which measures a basket of goods as well as energy and housing costs, rose 4.2% from a year ago, compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 3.6% increase. The monthly gain was 0.8%, against the expected 0.2%. Excluding the volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI (this is the main measure of inflation) increased 3% compared to the same period in 2020 and 0.9% on a monthly basis. The respective estimates were 2.3% and 0.3%. 

Yesterday, the producer price index (PPI), which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output, rose 6.2% compared to April 2020 and 0.6% monthly increase. The core PPI, which excludes volatile items like food and energy rose 4.6% year over year and 0.7% in April. Economists polled by FactSet were expecting a 0.3% monthly increase in April and 3.8% year over year. This is the biggest jump since 2014. In tandem with the CPI report, this shows prices for both consumers and producers has increased more than expected. 

However, while the readings in inflation definitely are not good, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be “transitory” as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, “We want to see a string of months like that \[like in March\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, there’s a very large group of people who are not.” The April Job Report bolsters Powell’s argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy. 

In addition, at a separate event in April, Powell said that quantitative easing would likely taper “well before” the interest rate is increased. He said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.” In short, while the inflationary readings are not great, I’m fairly confident fears that the Federal Reserve will tighten policy sooner-than-expected are overblown. Just my two cents.

261,TSM,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, May 5, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, May 5, 2021**

Stocks reversed from yesterday’s technology-led selloff, with the Dow Jones (DIA) reaching a new intraday record high. Continuing the recent bout of volatility, the three major indexes sold off in the last few hours of the market session, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) turning negative.   Market participants continue to look towards the slew of corporate earnings, new economic data, and commentary from key monetary policymakers. 

The sharp move lower in stock yesterday came, ostensibly, after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen suggested that interest rates may need to rise in the near-term to prevent the economy from overheating, with the recent economic data and corporate earnings showing economic activity recovering much faster than expected as effective distribution of the vaccine in the US allows states to gradually reopen. Yellen said, “It may be that interest rates will have to rise somewhat to make sure that our economy doesn't overheat, even though the additional spending is relatively small relative to the size of the economy. It could cause some very modest increases in interest rates to get that reallocation, but these are investments our economy needs to be competitive and to be productive. I think our economy will grow faster because of them."" In later remarks, she added that raising rates was not something she was predicting or recommending and that the decision ultimately rests with the Federal Reserve. She said, “Let me be clear, that’s not something I’m predicting or recommending. If anybody appreciates the independence of the Fed, I think that person is me.”

With the major indexes hovering near record levels for many consecutive days, equities were due for a pullback at the slightest mention of bad news. Kevin Mahm, chief investment officer at Hennion and Walsh Investment Management said, “I do think there's a potential for a short-term bounce in volatility due to those excessive valuations and all of the uncertainty that currently stands with respect to the infrastructure spending bill, ultimately how it’s going to be funded, and certain taxation policies. But, beyond the short-term bouts of volatility, there is continued reason for optimism, whether it’s consumer confidence, whether it’s the strength in earnings, recognizing that thus far we have an 86% beat rate for the companies that have reported.”

The Labor Department will release its April jobs report on Friday, which is expected to show a staggering nearly 1 million payrolls came back last month, accelerating March’s gain. As a reminder, in March, the Department of Labor reported nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 for the month while the unemployment rate fell to 6% (unemployment rate was 14.6% in April 2020). Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 675,000 and an unemployment rate of 6%.

**Highlights**

* As a reminder, the April Labor Report will be released on Friday. Will be important in gauging how the labor market is doing
* Shares of Peloton (PTON) sold off sharply after the company issued a recall of its Tread+ and Tread treadmills following a slew of accidents, including the death of a child. A few weeks ago, John Foley, CEO of Peloton, resisted calls from the US Consumer Product Safety, something he called a “mistake”. He said, “Peloton made a mistake in our initial response to the Consumer Product Safety Commission’s request that we recall the Tread+. We should have engaged more productively with them from the outset. For that, I apologize.”
* Tomorrow, May 6, EV maker NIO will hold a news conference where the company is expected to talk about it’s plans to expand to the European markets.
* Virgin Galactic (SPCE) shares drop after Blue Origin, Jeff Bezos space company, announced plans for first New Shepard suborbital flight in July of this year. Virgin Galactic plans to reopen ticket sales after the founder makes his own first flight, now slated for the summer after several delays.
* The U.S. Commerce Department is pressing Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) and other Taiwanese firms to prioritise the needs of U.S. automakers to ease chip shortages in the near term, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said.
* Factory orders rose 1.1% in March over February after a 0.5% drop the month prior, according to the Department of Commerce. This was still slightly short of 1.3% estimates.

262,TSM,Why You Should Short the Intel Fab Play,"Intel has risen on news that it will spend $20B on establishing chip manufacturing factories in Arizona, but this news is more bearish than bullish to me.

Investing in Intel now, is nonsensical once you consider the full situation. I reiterate my bearish position on Intel and recommend a diagonal put play.

I’ve more-or-less officially been an Intel bear for a few months now. As of late, many have asked me whether I am changing my stance on Intel due to its $20B manufacturing facility (FAB) production project. As much as I would love to reverse directions and proclaim myself a born-again Intel bull, I must objectively call Intel’s announcement as another bearish catalyst. In light of this news, I am happy to double down. Today, I will explain my viewpoint.

*The Fab Ahab:*

Ahab was the seventh king of Israel. He inherited a powerful kingdom but was eventually brought down due to his own vices and not upholding his responsibilities. Many consider Ahab to be Israel’s worst king.

Intel shares many similarities with Ahab. The company easily dominated the chip kingdom with its x86 IP, but this made Intel a bit too complacent: Easy money from x86 led the company to focus more on maintaining the status quo than moving the foundry market forward. In its comfort, Intel has lost its partnership with Apple (AAPL), who has successfully developed M1, a chip much more efficient than the previously used Intel x86 chips; failed to keep up with the shrinking node trends, currently struggling to produce 10nm chips while others are working on 3nm; and has even been overtaken by AMD, which long sat in Intel’s giant shadow. Intel’s story – to me – looks like a downfall story in the making.

Intel finally sees the need to fight back, and the two fabs in Arizona, due 2024, at the cost of $20B is the latest strategy. However, it is a risky strategy. Adding fabs to the business is not just a one-time cost of the $20B but requires consistent upkeep and upgrade costs, something more like $20B per year, which, over the coming decade, would be more than Intel’s total current equity. Intel is thus further adding operational costs to its business during a time when the company is expected to see shrinking revenue and earnings. Typically, the responsible reaction to such earnings decay is to cut down on costs. Intel would seemingly rather throw Hail Marys.

*Hail Mary:*

I call the fab announcement a Hail Mary not because adding fabs is inherently a bad idea but because Intel seems to have little time remaining on the clock to benefit from this action before it finds itself well behind its competitors. Intel should have built fabs years ago when it was still the market leader and still growing earnings. Intel could have become the go-to chip manufacturer in the US, but now it faces an uphill battle in light of how strong Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) have grown over the past decade.

At roughly the same time as Intel’s announcement to build fabs in Arizona, TSMC (henceforth TSM) announced its own fab construction in Arizona. Clearly, there is a rush to build fabs in the US, and the reason, too, is clear: China. The US reliance on Taiwanese fabs combined with increasing concerns over a Chinese invasion of Taiwan means that the US would love a modern fab stateside. That is, Intel’s decision to create fabs at this time was not decided in a vacuum; instead of the decision being a business-focused decision, it is a situation-focused decision – a decision of convenience rather than one for the sake of shareholders.

*Intel’s Fab Focus In Question:*

Intel could be attempting to cozy up to the US government with its new fabs. The Department of Defense certainly wants some fabs stateside as China’s shadow grows over Taiwan. Intel might be playing the Tesla (TSLA) game by looking for taxpayers to help subsidize its business, gaining a novel edge over AMD.

In any case, I don’t see the news fabs to be transformative for Intel in the positive sense. If Intel is really going all-in on fabs, we will need many years before we see a significant payoff. Investing in INTC now, during a time of nose-bleed tech valuations and during earnings contractions is not a smart investment decision.

And if Intel is looking for government subsidies by being the main US chip manufacturer, this is essentially a white flag; Intel cannot compete in the game of technological advancements and needs a handicap. This is not Tesla being subsidized as it forays into a fledgling industry but an old, stubborn company attempting to stay afloat via means outside its own merits. You would be better off investing in AMD or TSMC if you want exposure in US chip design or manufacturing.

Overall, I reiterate my bearish outlook on Intel relative to the rest of the chip industry. The upward momentum in Intel and its current price are not sustainable by the news: The fabs and other aspects I’ve mentioned in previous articles are perceived as bullish while they are in fact bearish.",0,1,1620157893.0,2021-05-04T19:51:33+00:00,t3_n4wfiy,StockMarket

&amp;nbsp;

The [items of business](https://i.imgur.com/5wxsOvY.png) for the meeting include an approval from stakeholders to allow the company to **increase the number of authorized shares of common stocks**. This is what is called a [share dilution](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/11/dangers-of-stock-dilution.asp). 

Going further through the proxy statement document, we have the details for Proposal 4 — Approval of an Amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to Increase the Number of Authorized Shares of Common Stock **from 2 Billion Shares to 4 Billion Shares** https://i.imgur.com/6Myo5r7.png

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Description of the Proposed Amendment
Our Charter currently authorizes the issuance of up to two billion shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share,
and two million shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share.
On April 7, 2021, our Board adopted resolutions approving an amendment to the Charter to **increase the number of
authorized shares of common stock from two billion shares to four billion shares. Our Board is recommending the
proposed increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock to provide adequate shares of common stock
for general corporate purposes, as further described below. The Board determined that the Proposed Amendment is
advisable and in the best interests of the Company and directed that the proposed Amendment be submitted for
adoption and approval by stockholders at the Meeting.**

...

&gt;If our stockholders adopt and approve the Proposed Amendment, the Proposed Amendment will become effective on the
date that it is filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware

...

&gt;As a general matter, the increase in our authorized but unissued shares of common stock as a result of the Proposed
Amendment **would enable the Board to issue additional shares of common stock in its discretion from time to time for**
general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, *expanding our business through mergers and acquisitions,
including shares we would be obligated to issue* **in connection with the pending acquisition of Arm Limited**; stock
dividends and/or stock splits; providing equity incentives to employees, officers or directors; and the raising of additional
capital. Such issuances would occur **without further action or approval of our stockholders** and would be subject to and
limited by any rules or listing requirements of Nasdaq or of any other applicable rules or regulations.

...

&gt;Failure by the stockholders to approve the Proposed Amendment would reduce the ability of the Board to take the
potential future actions to issue additional common stock discussed above.

...

&gt;**The Board recommends that you vote FOR the approval** of the Proposed Amendment to increase the number of
authorized shares of common stock from two billion shares to four billion shares.

Other parts I found interesting in their 10-K form (same doc, pg91):

- they make a [statement regarding the pending acquisition of ARM](https://i.imgur.com/bk38IIf.png); TLDR; they put a downpayment on it; they say it will happen, and they give an estimate for Q1 2022. also, softbank get paid lotsa $$ and shares. if it doesn't happen for whatever reasons, the company *may not be able to successfully integrate acquisition targets, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell products*
- they specialize in the [gaming, professional visualisation \(VR\), data center, and automotive industries](https://i.imgur.com/b4unjGl.png);  gaming &amp; data center 🚀
- they talk about [risks and risk strategy](https://i.imgur.com/3ROHfMe.png); they are reliant on industry-leading foundries, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. to manufacture our semiconductors

Please go through the document by yourselves (link at the top). I am not experienced, nor that smart. I did not read everything in the document.

I am thinking to vote for approval of proposal 4. In my opinion it is good for the long term. Please remember you are responsible for your own financial decisions. I hold a low amount of shares, and I'll be holding for the long term.

Edit: today's green day brought the price above the resistance line at $614.24. Consolidation in the 600-640 area looks good for the next 2 weeks, unless news catalysts. I am not experienced so make of this what you will.

175,TSM,Transitioning to a safer portfolio,"
So I started investing in the end of January and I was very tech bullish. I’m a student with 10k invested. Getting around 300/month from a job. January turned out to be a bad time to start in tech - especially the popular speculative stocks. Anyways I made some mistakes but am fine holding everything I own for the long term. I need to start investing into broader sectors. Here’s my portfolio atm :

AAPL : 32%

PLTR : 12.3%

NIO : 10.4%

ARK (F,G,K) : 21%

XPEV : 6%

TSM : 2%

UAL : 3%

AMD : 2%

NGA : 5%

IPOE  : 5%

I need to start putting a small amount each month into something like a VTI though I’m hesitant right now at ATH so looking for a SPY pullback. There are still quite a few stocks I really want to get a hold of (DIS, MSFT, BABA, TSLA) but they also are too expensive right now. 

Should I be focusing on just building up my index fund position? If I do that I won’t have much at all left to buy my highest conviction watchlist stocks. And even less to build positions in other sectors. Is that even necessary?",13,31,1619214370.0,2021-04-23T21:46:10+00:00,t3_mx5wbt,stocks

I hate that the guy was right, but he was right...  So, maybe he's right about his new target, as well.  Also, AMD has tons of price targets in the $100+ range, and all the rumors and news points to a gangbusters Q1 earnings ($WDC, $MU, $IBM, and $TSM, all major players in the PC and data center space has had huge revenue beats), it's crazy that the stock is still under $80 just a week before earnings!

Personally, from my own attempts at TA \[[https://i.imgur.com/rpDaio0.png](https://i.imgur.com/rpDaio0.png)\], I believe $AMD is at the bottom of it's current price channel, and the stock is going to start recovering towards Q1 earnings; my hope is that AMD will experience a Parabolic jump like it did on July of last year, the situations are similar, where it spent long periods of trading sideways, while the rest of the tech sector was booming, AMD being flat then didn't make any sense, nor does it now.

72,TSM,"Tossing my small-street hat in the ring. No hype, just my moves in my betting account and some commentary, assuming you do better DD on 10k's and Free Level 2 analysis at TD.","Here are my plays today:

**SRET:** Ongoing Buy +20.  Total: 165 shares.  Up $36.00 (plus this one does divs).  I may just start buying this hard into my ROTH IRA.  I bought it for the growth, but will likely end up paying taxes on the DIVs (unless I sell some of the losses below, LOL).

**UMC:**  Hold, bought to close CCs from last two days.  Total:  220 shares.  Up $20 on the CCs, Down $28.15 on stock.  

Generally I am long term bullish on Semiconductors, and the market cap here means UMC still has room to grow, unlike TSM.  The only other Semiconductor stock I wish I could buy directly is Samsung!  I would have been loading up on LEAPs on Samsung if I could have.  Of the semiconductors I can buy on Schwab or TD, this one is my favorite, and I have &gt;100 shares also in my IRA, along with TXN.  I also have two cash covered puts on UMC at 7.50, expiring in July.  If she starts to run, I might seize profit on those to free up the 1500 dollars, probably to buy more SRET and SUTNY or UMC &amp; FLXN on a dip -- whatever is good.

**FLXN:**  Hold, keep covered call in place.  Total:  100 shares.  Up 27 Dollars plus 60 for the 5/14 10C.  I am looking for a short-term win here, hoping to get assigned in May.  Obviously I would like to get assigned for under 10.60.  10.01 would be awesome.  :)

**CGIFF:**  Hold.  Total: 10 shares.  Down $0.38

**SUTNY:**  Buy 50.  Total:  150 shares.  Down $3.52.  I am long term fairly bullish on SUTNY, the dividend and growth should end up good going forward, but Japan is hurt by COVID.  This one might be like PBF was last year (if anyone traded on that, you would know what I mean).

**TGA:**  Hold.  Total: 10 shares.  Down $.09

**HYSR:**  Buy 110.  Total: 7351 shares.  Down $529.92.  After the initial blastoff on this one I bought more and ended up in the red on the down turn.  However, I am long term bullish here, this stock doesn't have a lot of Hype, and I think ~.30 around this time next year.  Meanwhile, I buy every time it hits a dime.

**VMHG:**  Hold.  Total 25 shares.  Down $4.59.  Interesting company, read about it on this forum.  I think it needs COVID to go away to really run.  Lotto ticket with &lt;25 USD.

**VPER:**  Hold.  Total 1500 shares.  Up $3.07.  Ditto Lotto ticket.  Also read about this one here.

**DIGAF:**  Hold.  Total 350 shares.  Down $0.59.  Lotto I didn't like as much as VPER.  VPER actually sells something with legs.  This one I was less sold on, hence my 4 dollar buy-in.

*Questions okay.  I plan to update once-ish every week or two or if I make any big moves.*

EDIT:  3PM: Added 1 x UMC 10/21 5 P on a limit buy @ .10.  Have been trying to buy that all day, as it's right about at today's IV and price Limits.  I think IV might spike one or two more times during earnings season (UMC announces on 4/2x --forgot exactly which day), and it gives me an insurance on ""outside chance"" risks on my UMC through the summer, which has a decent chance of sucking.  Depending on how cheap they get over the next days, I may add one more 10/21 5P or else a 7.5P.  Again, hopefully pressuring a very low price on the IV -- would be really nice if UMC rallies a couple of dimes tomorrow.",27,10,1618505469.0,2021-04-15T16:51:09+00:00,t3_mriseq,SmallStreetBets

Some highlights:

&gt; The world’s largest contract chipmaker said Thursday that its **automaker industry clients can expect chip shortages to begin easing next quarter**, alleviating some of the supply disruptions that have forced the likes of GM and Ford to curtail production. **But overall deficits of critical semiconductors will last throughout 2021 and potentially into next year**, Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei told analysts on a conference call.

&gt; [...]

&gt; TSMC now expects investments of about **$30 billion on capacity expansions and upgrades this year, after spending $8.8 billion in the first three months, Chief Financial Officer Wendell Huang said. The company had previously forecast spending of as much as $28 billion.** Sales in the June quarter may reach $13.2 billion, beating the average $12.8 billion seen by analysts, while full-year revenue may climb 20% in dollar terms, ahead of the “mid-teens” growth predicted in January.

&gt; [...]

&gt; **Net income for the January-March period climbed 19% to NT$139.7 billion ($4.9 billion), versus the average analyst estimate of NT$136.2 billion.** Gross margin for the quarter eased to 52.4% from 54% in the three months prior, due in part to relatively lower levels of utilization and exchange-rate fluctuations. First-quarter revenue rose 17% to NT$362.4 billion, according to a company statement last week.

84,TSM,"Expected moves for this week. BABA, BAC, BBBY, WFC, APHA and more.","As I do each week, here's a look at the state of options volatility, what that means for this week in the broad ETFs, a look at some stocks in the news and a preview of this week's earnings. All through the lens of expected moves. The expected move is not a prediction of exactly how a stock will react, but an actionable signal of how options traders are pricing the moves. That can be applied to not only analyzing risk, spotting opportunity, but more specifically strike selection, whether that be covered calls, iron condors, or directional spreads (or to tell you how crazy your OTM call might be). As always let me know in the comments anything I missed or anything interesting on your radar.

### The Broader Markets

**Last Week –** The **SPY** closed last week at new highs, up more than **2.5%** on the week, a move well beyond the **1.1%** move options were pricing. Despite that outsized move, market implied volatility in options fell even lower. The **VIX** is now below 17 and at its lowest level in a year.

**Expected Moves for the Week of April 12th:**

* SPY 1%
* QQQ 1.6%
* IWM 2.3%

**SPY** options are pricing a **1%** move in either direction for the upcoming week. That corresponds to about **$406** as a *bearish consensus* and **$415** as a *bullish consensus*. A 1% expected move is down significantly from the 3% weekly expected moves from just a few months ago. Here’s this week’s expected move in SPY, highlighted on the chart:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uximm5slols61.png?width=563&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e088348a5d35c71d99bab800cd0fb56cdccc1ef

From a trader’s perspective, hedges and outright directional positioning costs less than they have in more than a year. Actual moves in the market can quickly go beyond what options are pricing. Last week’s 2.7% move higher in the SPY is a prime example.

Short premium strategies, where an investor collects premium (income) from selling options, are also affected by lower volatility. It forces a choice between selling options that are closer to the current stock price (giving less room to be wrong) or continuing to sell further out the money options and receiving less premium (giving a lower risk / reward ratio).

On Friday I compared two short premium strategies, the covered call, and and Iron Condor. [You can read that comparison here](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/mnkpww/covered_calls_are_good_for_getting_called_away/) (reddit link) and see how the expected move plays a part in those types of trades.

Although the current levels of implied volatility are the lowest in more than a year, they are not historically low. The VIX was 12 before the Covid sell-of in early 2020, it has spent the last few months compressing from the 30’s to where it is now.

## In the News

**Alibaba (BABA)** and the Chinese government reached a settlement on anti-trust accusations, the news was released late in the day Friday. As of Friday’s close, BABA options were pricing in about a **3.5%** move for this week, and a nearly **8%** move for the next month. That 3.5% expected move for this week corresponds to about **$231** for a bullish consensus and roughly **$215** for bearish ([chart](https://14eaka193uhe3z4zmwffpyc4-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-11-at-11.58.19-AM.png))

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 12th, 2021.

# **Earning season is about to get underway and that could be a positive catalyst for stocks - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/09/earning-season-is-about-to-get-underway-and-that-could-be-a-positive-catalyst-for-stocks.html)**
*****
&gt; The earnings reporting season gets underway in the week ahead, and it is expected to be a positive catalyst that could continue to send stocks higher for now.
*****
&gt; The Dow and S&amp;P 500 start the week at record highs after a strong rally Friday.
*****
&gt; The coming week is packed with Federal Reserve speakers and important data, including a much anticipated inflation reading Tuesday, when the consumer price index is released. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell kicks off another busy week for Fed appearances with a Sunday evening interview on “60 Minutes.” He also speaks Wednesday at an Economic Club of Washington event.
*****
&gt; Powell, in comments this past week, continued to reinforce that the Fed will keep its easy policies in place for a long time, and that any emergence of inflation should be temporary. But hotter-than-expected producer price inflation data Friday has made the consumer price index release Tuesday all the more important. PPI gained 1%, double the expected increase.
*****
&gt; Kevin Cummins, chief U.S. economist at NatWest Markets, said he expects core CPI to rise 0.2% for March, or 1.5% year-over-year, but headline inflation should rise 0.5% or 2.5% year-over-year. Cummins said March is the beginning of a period where inflation could appear greater, just because of the comparison to low levels last year when the economy was shut down.
*****
&gt; “I think the Fed has already moved ahead of it,” Cummins said. He expects CPI to peak at 3.6% in May but then calm down during the summer.
*****
&gt; The other key piece of data in the coming week is the retail sales report for March, which Cummins said could show a 10% gain. The Dow Jones consensus forecast is for a 5.6% gain, following a 3% decline in February.
*****
&gt; Cummins said March sales should be boosted by the $1,400 stimulus checks sent to individuals, which started reaching bank accounts in mid-March. More of the economy has also been opening up, as more people get vaccinated.
*****
&gt; “The back end of the month should be very strong,” he said. “If you look at auto sales, that was the highest level in four years. It seems like restaurants are getting more crowded, with outdoor seating.”
*****
&gt; # Earnings season
&gt; But it may be the earnings season that is the real tell for the economy.
*****
&gt; “It isn’t what they report,” said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. “For the first time, we are going to hear more and more companies now actually making comments about the future. Are they going to upwardly revise some of their outlooks or are they not? That’s what’s really going to be key about it.”
*****
&gt; The big banks kick off the reporting Wednesday, with JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo. Bank of America and Citigroup report Thursday. Morgan Stanley reports Friday. PepsiCo and Delta Airlines are also among the first to report.

&gt; “The consensus for the first quarter is earnings are supposed to be up roughly 22%. We have an easy comp from last year. That number could be closer to 30%,” said Brian Rauscher, head of global portfolio strategy at Fundstrat.
*****
&gt; Rauscher said he expects the most earnings beats to be in the cyclical sectors, like consumer discretionary, financials and materials, all sectors that benefit from the reopening economy.
*****
&gt; “I think earnings season is going to be constructive, and it’s going to be good enough to keep the market going higher,” he said.
*****
&gt; Based on estimates and early reports, Refinitiv now expects earnings growth of 25% for the first quarter. Companies have been beating estimates so far at a pace of 81%. Earnings for the financial sector are expected to be up 76%. The consumer discretionary sector was hit hard by shutdowns a year ago, and its earnings are expected to bounce back by 98%, according to Refinitiv.
*****
&gt; “I think what we’re going to start to see is the operating leverage for these companies is really underappreciated. The earnings are going to start to come back faster than the revenues,” said Rauscher. “Corporate America has really done a good job in the last year of streamlining their operations, their cost structures and everything else. Revenues could come back 50%, and earnings could come back 100%.”
*****
&gt; The major stock market indices were higher in the past week, but small caps lagged with the Russell 2000 losing ground. The Dow rose nearly 2% for the week, ending at a record 33,800, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 2.7% to a record 4,128. The Nasdaq was the leader, gaining 3.1% to 13,900. The Russell was down a half percent at 2,243.
*****
&gt; The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield stayed in the mid zone of its recent range. On Friday afternoon, it was at 1.65%, well below its recent high of 1.77%.

&gt; # As Close to a Perfect Year For Equities as You Can Get

&gt; Every day in our Morning Lineup, we provide a technical snapshot of the market looking at various metrics. One chart we show is the relative strength of stocks (S&amp;P 500) versus bonds (US Treasury Long Bond Future) over the trailing 12 months (chart below). Whenever the line is in the green area, it indicates that stocks are outperforming bonds relative to the start date, while readings in the red zone indicate bonds outperforming stocks. What stood out about the chart in this morning's report was the fact that relative to one year ago (4/1 close), stocks have been outperforming bonds every day since. Sure, there have been periods in between where bonds outperformed stocks (falling line), but from a longer-term perspective, it has been about as perfect a year for stocks relative to bonds as you could imagine.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/040721-Bonds-vs-Stocks.png))**

&gt; The chart below shows the performance of both asset classes individually over the last year. If you think the divide between political parties in the US has ripped wider, it has nothing on the growing divide between stocks and bonds. While the S&amp;P 500 is up over 50%, the US Treasury Long Bond Future is down 14%. If we had to bet on which divide will start to narrow sooner, is there anything closer to a sure thing than taking the stock vs bond divide over the Democrat vs Republican divide?

&gt; # Blowout Q1 Harbinger For More Gains

&gt; Well-above average Q1 gains for DJIA and S&amp;P 500 bode well for continued gains in 2021. DJIA’s 2021 Q1 gain of 7.8% is significantly higher than its historical average of 2.0% and the 17th best Q1 gain since 1949. S&amp;P’s 5.8% gain was also substantially higher than its average of 2.1% and the 19th best since 1949. NASDAQ was the laggard up only 2.8% in Q1 this year, which is actually below its average of 4.1% since 1971 and the 28th best since 1971.

&gt; In any event positive Q1 returns have been a harbinger for continued market gains for the year as whole. As you would imagine, subsequent Q2 and Q3 returns during the Worst Six Months are not as strong as Q4 at the outset of the Best Six Months. As you can see in the tables below, Q2 and Q3 post positive average numbers, but returns are lower than Q1 and Q4 and there are more losers.

&gt; Further gains for the year as a whole failed materialized for DJIA in 1956, 1971, 1979, 1981 1987, 2002, 2011 and 2012 with lackluster performance for the remainder of the year in 1976 and 1992. S&amp;P failed to produce additional gains in 1956, 1981 1987, 2000, 2011 and 2015 with weak gains for the rest of 1971, 1986 and 2012. NASDAQ failed to add to Q1 gains in 1974, 1981, 1986, 1987, 2000, 2011, 2012 and 2018 with paltry showings for balance of 1975, 1983, 1988, 2006 and 2015.

&gt; Overall positive returns for Q1 resulted in full-year gains for: DJIA 40 out of the last 42 times with an average gain of 16.4% (median 16.3%); S&amp;P 41 out of 45 times with an average return of 16.4% (median 15.6%), and NASDAQ 28 of 34 with an average gain of 18.9% (median 17.0%).

&gt; # LPL Market Signals: Raising Economic and Market Forecasts…Again

&gt; On the LPL Market Signals podcast, Equity Strategist Jeff Buchbinder and Asset Allocation Strategist Barry Gilbert update forecasts based on how the economy’s recovery from the pandemic, aided by vaccine distribution, massive stimulus, and the desire to return to normal, continues to surpass expectations.

&gt; Strong March jobs report. The US labor market grew the most in seven months in March, as the economy added 916,000 jobs, trouncing the median economists’ estimate for a 660,000 gain (source: Bloomberg). Segments of the labor market most dependent on in-person interaction saw the greatest gains, notably hospitality and leisure. We expect to see bigger job gains in the coming months, potentially over one million per month into the summer, helping to close the gap on the more than eight million jobs still needed to get back to the pre-pandemic peak.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.7.21-Blog-CHart-2.png?ssl=1)**

&gt; **Raising U.S. and global economic growth forecasts.** An accelerating vaccine rollout, American’s desire to resume somewhat normal lives, and massive stimulus set the stage for booming growth in the U.S. economy this year. Our 2021 U.S. GDP growth forecast goes from 5—5.5% to 6.25—6.75%. A stronger U.S. growth outlook pushes LPL Research’s expectations for growth in emerging markets and globally higher as well.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.7.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1)**

&gt; **Raising our 2021 S&amp;P 500 earnings estimate.** With more economic growth comes more revenue opportunities for corporate America. Companies have been doing a tremendous job of adapting the pandemic, innovating, and generating efficiencies. We are leaving our year-end fair value target for the S&amp;P 500 Index unchanged at 4,050—4,100 for now in anticipation of lower stock valuations as interest rates rise.

&gt; **Raising our year-end target range for the 10-Year U.S. Treasury yield.** Stronger economic growth and more stimulus spending may put further upward pressure on yields. We have raised our forecast for the US 10-year Treasury yield from 1.25—1.75% to 1.75—2.00%.

&gt; # Global Growth Expectations on the Rise

&gt; Before the pandemic we had begun to warm up to international stocks. Valuations relative to the U.S. markets had become increasingly attractive after a long stretch of outperformance by U.S. stocks compared with those in Europe and Japan. We had also anticipated that a weaker U.S. dollar would enhance international stock returns for U.S.-based investors.

&gt; Then the pandemic hit. Since then we have maintained our preference for U.S. stocks over their developed international counterparts. In 2020 the U.S. market benefited from its heavy concentration in technology, digital media, and e-commerce stocks that are well positioned for the stay-at-home and work-from-home environment. More recently, as the Eurozone has struggled to contain COVID-19, our conviction in our U.S. preference has increased.

&gt; “As the end of the pandemic has come closer into view and value stocks do better in anticipation of a full reopening, the environment should theoretically be better for international stocks,” said LPL Financial Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. “But the global dominance of the U.S. market has continued in 2021, in part due to sluggish vaccine distribution in Europe, and LPL Research continues to favor U.S. stocks over those in Europe and Japan.”

&gt; A look at consensus expectations for economic growth around the world supports our preference for the U.S. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, not only is gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the U.S. expected to outpace Europe, the UK, Japan, and the broad emerging markets this year, but the U.S. has also seen the biggest increase in consensus expectations for GDP growth year to date—an increase of 1.9 percentage points to near 6% (source Bloomberg). Earlier this week we upgraded our U.S. GDP growth forecasts for 2021 to 6.25%—6.75%, while maintaining our growth forecast for developed international economies at 3.75%—4.25%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.8.21-Blog-CHart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; The reopening of the U.S. economy amid the accelerating pace of vaccine distribution is certainly a big driver of the increase in growth expectations this year. But massive fiscal stimulus—now over $5 trillion—is another key part of the story.

&gt; The chart below illustrates how massive this stimulus is relative to the size of the U.S. economy (about 26%), and also how much larger it has been than the response to the Global Financial Crisis in 2008-2009. While U.S. stimulus is comparable in size to Europe’s, U.S. stimulus has included more direct payments and spending, and therefore has been more impactful than stimulus in Europe, which has included more loan guarantees.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.8.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; We continue to recommend investors focus their regional tactical allocations on the U.S. and underweight developed international equities. We also recommend a modest allocation to emerging market equities, where suitable, to take advantage of a strong economic growth outlook and attractive valuations.

&gt; # A Goldilocks First Quarter Has Bulls Smiling

&gt; Stocks have kicked off the year in a strong fashion, and history shows this may give reason to be optimistic for the rest of the year. After a solid—but certainly turbulent—year in 2020, the S&amp;P 500 Index has continued to set new all-time highs in 2021, returning 5.8% in the first quarter.

&gt; “Momentum breeds momentum, but you may not want too much of it,” said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Hitting singles and doubles has historically been the sweet spot for first quarter returns.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, returns between 5-10% have been the “Goldilocks” level in the first quarter, with an average return of 12.4% through the rest of the year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/revised-blog.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Returns through the rest of the year have historically been the worst when the S&amp;P 500 is negative in the first quarter, averaging just 3.1%. However, too much momentum in the first quarter may not be ideal, either. When the S&amp;P 500 has returned more than 10% in the first quarter, returns through the rest of the year have averaged 6.5%.

&gt; 1987 is a year that is often referred to as the year of the “blow-off top,” as the S&amp;P 500 returned over 40% through its peak in August, with over a 20% return in the first quarter alone. This was the only year with a first quarter return greater than 10% that was negative through the rest of the year, but removing 1987 from the data only raises the average to 8.7%, not enough to beat the 5-10% return group.

&gt; # Typical April Trading: Strength from Start to Finish

&gt; Over the recent 21 years April is the top-ranked month for DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000. April ranks #2 S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ. Average gains over the period range from a low of 1.91% by NASDAQ to a respectable 2.30% by DJIA. The first half of April used to outperform the second half, but since 1994 that has no longer been the case. In fact the second half of April is just as strong over the recent 21-year period.

&gt; Early April trading is usually positive for the first 4 days then flattens off around the seventh trading day. At which point, there is just a hint of weakness heading into mid-month. Then the market tends to resume its charge higher through month’s end. DJIA tends to close out the month strongest with NASDAQ closing weakest. This year the market is enjoying above average gains so far this April. NASDAQ is strongest, up 4.40% as of yesterday’s close. Russell 2000 is the laggard, up a modest 0.99%.

73,TSM,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning April 12th, 2021","Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 12th, 2021.

# **Earning season is about to get underway and that could be a positive catalyst for stocks - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/09/earning-season-is-about-to-get-underway-and-that-could-be-a-positive-catalyst-for-stocks.html)**
*****
&gt; The earnings reporting season gets underway in the week ahead, and it is expected to be a positive catalyst that could continue to send stocks higher for now.
*****
&gt; The Dow and S&amp;P 500 start the week at record highs after a strong rally Friday.
*****
&gt; The coming week is packed with Federal Reserve speakers and important data, including a much anticipated inflation reading Tuesday, when the consumer price index is released. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell kicks off another busy week for Fed appearances with a Sunday evening interview on “60 Minutes.” He also speaks Wednesday at an Economic Club of Washington event.
*****
&gt; Powell, in comments this past week, continued to reinforce that the Fed will keep its easy policies in place for a long time, and that any emergence of inflation should be temporary. But hotter-than-expected producer price inflation data Friday has made the consumer price index release Tuesday all the more important. PPI gained 1%, double the expected increase.
*****
&gt; Kevin Cummins, chief U.S. economist at NatWest Markets, said he expects core CPI to rise 0.2% for March, or 1.5% year-over-year, but headline inflation should rise 0.5% or 2.5% year-over-year. Cummins said March is the beginning of a period where inflation could appear greater, just because of the comparison to low levels last year when the economy was shut down.
*****
&gt; “I think the Fed has already moved ahead of it,” Cummins said. He expects CPI to peak at 3.6% in May but then calm down during the summer.
*****
&gt; The other key piece of data in the coming week is the retail sales report for March, which Cummins said could show a 10% gain. The Dow Jones consensus forecast is for a 5.6% gain, following a 3% decline in February.
*****
&gt; Cummins said March sales should be boosted by the $1,400 stimulus checks sent to individuals, which started reaching bank accounts in mid-March. More of the economy has also been opening up, as more people get vaccinated.
*****
&gt; “The back end of the month should be very strong,” he said. “If you look at auto sales, that was the highest level in four years. It seems like restaurants are getting more crowded, with outdoor seating.”
*****
&gt; # Earnings season
&gt; But it may be the earnings season that is the real tell for the economy.
*****
&gt; “It isn’t what they report,” said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. “For the first time, we are going to hear more and more companies now actually making comments about the future. Are they going to upwardly revise some of their outlooks or are they not? That’s what’s really going to be key about it.”
*****
&gt; The big banks kick off the reporting Wednesday, with JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo. Bank of America and Citigroup report Thursday. Morgan Stanley reports Friday. PepsiCo and Delta Airlines are also among the first to report.
*****
&gt; “The consensus for the first quarter is earnings are supposed to be up roughly 22%. We have an easy comp from last year. That number could be closer to 30%,” said Brian Rauscher, head of global portfolio strategy at Fundstrat.
*****
&gt; Rauscher said he expects the most earnings beats to be in the cyclical sectors, like consumer discretionary, financials and materials, all sectors that benefit from the reopening economy.
*****
&gt; “I think earnings season is going to be constructive, and it’s going to be good enough to keep the market going higher,” he said.
*****
&gt; Based on estimates and early reports, Refinitiv now expects earnings growth of 25% for the first quarter. Companies have been beating estimates so far at a pace of 81%. Earnings for the financial sector are expected to be up 76%. The consumer discretionary sector was hit hard by shutdowns a year ago, and its earnings are expected to bounce back by 98%, according to Refinitiv.
*****
&gt; “I think what we’re going to start to see is the operating leverage for these companies is really underappreciated. The earnings are going to start to come back faster than the revenues,” said Rauscher. “Corporate America has really done a good job in the last year of streamlining their operations, their cost structures and everything else. Revenues could come back 50%, and earnings could come back 100%.”
*****
&gt; The major stock market indices were higher in the past week, but small caps lagged with the Russell 2000 losing ground. The Dow rose nearly 2% for the week, ending at a record 33,800, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 2.7% to a record 4,128. The Nasdaq was the leader, gaining 3.1% to 13,900. The Russell was down a half percent at 2,243.
*****
&gt; The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield stayed in the mid zone of its recent range. On Friday afternoon, it was at 1.65%, well below its recent high of 1.77%.

&gt; # As Close to a Perfect Year For Equities as You Can Get

&gt; Every day in our Morning Lineup, we provide a technical snapshot of the market looking at various metrics. One chart we show is the relative strength of stocks (S&amp;P 500) versus bonds (US Treasury Long Bond Future) over the trailing 12 months (chart below). Whenever the line is in the green area, it indicates that stocks are outperforming bonds relative to the start date, while readings in the red zone indicate bonds outperforming stocks. What stood out about the chart in this morning's report was the fact that relative to one year ago (4/1 close), stocks have been outperforming bonds every day since. Sure, there have been periods in between where bonds outperformed stocks (falling line), but from a longer-term perspective, it has been about as perfect a year for stocks relative to bonds as you could imagine.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/040721-Bonds-vs-Stocks.png))**

&gt; The chart below shows the performance of both asset classes individually over the last year. If you think the divide between political parties in the US has ripped wider, it has nothing on the growing divide between stocks and bonds. While the S&amp;P 500 is up over 50%, the US Treasury Long Bond Future is down 14%. If we had to bet on which divide will start to narrow sooner, is there anything closer to a sure thing than taking the stock vs bond divide over the Democrat vs Republican divide?

&gt; # Blowout Q1 Harbinger For More Gains

&gt; Well-above average Q1 gains for DJIA and S&amp;P 500 bode well for continued gains in 2021. DJIA’s 2021 Q1 gain of 7.8% is significantly higher than its historical average of 2.0% and the 17th best Q1 gain since 1949. S&amp;P’s 5.8% gain was also substantially higher than its average of 2.1% and the 19th best since 1949. NASDAQ was the laggard up only 2.8% in Q1 this year, which is actually below its average of 4.1% since 1971 and the 28th best since 1971.

&gt; In any event positive Q1 returns have been a harbinger for continued market gains for the year as whole. As you would imagine, subsequent Q2 and Q3 returns during the Worst Six Months are not as strong as Q4 at the outset of the Best Six Months. As you can see in the tables below, Q2 and Q3 post positive average numbers, but returns are lower than Q1 and Q4 and there are more losers.

&gt; Further gains for the year as a whole failed materialized for DJIA in 1956, 1971, 1979, 1981 1987, 2002, 2011 and 2012 with lackluster performance for the remainder of the year in 1976 and 1992. S&amp;P failed to produce additional gains in 1956, 1981 1987, 2000, 2011 and 2015 with weak gains for the rest of 1971, 1986 and 2012. NASDAQ failed to add to Q1 gains in 1974, 1981, 1986, 1987, 2000, 2011, 2012 and 2018 with paltry showings for balance of 1975, 1983, 1988, 2006 and 2015.

&gt; Overall positive returns for Q1 resulted in full-year gains for: DJIA 40 out of the last 42 times with an average gain of 16.4% (median 16.3%); S&amp;P 41 out of 45 times with an average return of 16.4% (median 15.6%), and NASDAQ 28 of 34 with an average gain of 18.9% (median 17.0%).

&gt; # LPL Market Signals: Raising Economic and Market Forecasts…Again

&gt; On the LPL Market Signals podcast, Equity Strategist Jeff Buchbinder and Asset Allocation Strategist Barry Gilbert update forecasts based on how the economy’s recovery from the pandemic, aided by vaccine distribution, massive stimulus, and the desire to return to normal, continues to surpass expectations.

&gt; Strong March jobs report. The US labor market grew the most in seven months in March, as the economy added 916,000 jobs, trouncing the median economists’ estimate for a 660,000 gain (source: Bloomberg). Segments of the labor market most dependent on in-person interaction saw the greatest gains, notably hospitality and leisure. We expect to see bigger job gains in the coming months, potentially over one million per month into the summer, helping to close the gap on the more than eight million jobs still needed to get back to the pre-pandemic peak.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.7.21-Blog-CHart-2.png?ssl=1)**

&gt; **Raising U.S. and global economic growth forecasts.** An accelerating vaccine rollout, American’s desire to resume somewhat normal lives, and massive stimulus set the stage for booming growth in the U.S. economy this year. Our 2021 U.S. GDP growth forecast goes from 5—5.5% to 6.25—6.75%. A stronger U.S. growth outlook pushes LPL Research’s expectations for growth in emerging markets and globally higher as well.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.7.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1)**

&gt; **Raising our 2021 S&amp;P 500 earnings estimate.** With more economic growth comes more revenue opportunities for corporate America. Companies have been doing a tremendous job of adapting the pandemic, innovating, and generating efficiencies. We are leaving our year-end fair value target for the S&amp;P 500 Index unchanged at 4,050—4,100 for now in anticipation of lower stock valuations as interest rates rise.

&gt; **Raising our year-end target range for the 10-Year U.S. Treasury yield.** Stronger economic growth and more stimulus spending may put further upward pressure on yields. We have raised our forecast for the US 10-year Treasury yield from 1.25—1.75% to 1.75—2.00%.

&gt; # Global Growth Expectations on the Rise

&gt; Before the pandemic we had begun to warm up to international stocks. Valuations relative to the U.S. markets had become increasingly attractive after a long stretch of outperformance by U.S. stocks compared with those in Europe and Japan. We had also anticipated that a weaker U.S. dollar would enhance international stock returns for U.S.-based investors.

&gt; Then the pandemic hit. Since then we have maintained our preference for U.S. stocks over their developed international counterparts. In 2020 the U.S. market benefited from its heavy concentration in technology, digital media, and e-commerce stocks that are well positioned for the stay-at-home and work-from-home environment. More recently, as the Eurozone has struggled to contain COVID-19, our conviction in our U.S. preference has increased.

&gt; “As the end of the pandemic has come closer into view and value stocks do better in anticipation of a full reopening, the environment should theoretically be better for international stocks,” said LPL Financial Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. “But the global dominance of the U.S. market has continued in 2021, in part due to sluggish vaccine distribution in Europe, and LPL Research continues to favor U.S. stocks over those in Europe and Japan.”

&gt; A look at consensus expectations for economic growth around the world supports our preference for the U.S. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, not only is gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the U.S. expected to outpace Europe, the UK, Japan, and the broad emerging markets this year, but the U.S. has also seen the biggest increase in consensus expectations for GDP growth year to date—an increase of 1.9 percentage points to near 6% (source Bloomberg). Earlier this week we upgraded our U.S. GDP growth forecasts for 2021 to 6.25%—6.75%, while maintaining our growth forecast for developed international economies at 3.75%—4.25%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.8.21-Blog-CHart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; The reopening of the U.S. economy amid the accelerating pace of vaccine distribution is certainly a big driver of the increase in growth expectations this year. But massive fiscal stimulus—now over $5 trillion—is another key part of the story.

&gt; The chart below illustrates how massive this stimulus is relative to the size of the U.S. economy (about 26%), and also how much larger it has been than the response to the Global Financial Crisis in 2008-2009. While U.S. stimulus is comparable in size to Europe’s, U.S. stimulus has included more direct payments and spending, and therefore has been more impactful than stimulus in Europe, which has included more loan guarantees.

&gt; We continue to recommend investors focus their regional tactical allocations on the U.S. and underweight developed international equities. We also recommend a modest allocation to emerging market equities, where suitable, to take advantage of a strong economic growth outlook and attractive valuations.

&gt; # A Goldilocks First Quarter Has Bulls Smiling

&gt; Stocks have kicked off the year in a strong fashion, and history shows this may give reason to be optimistic for the rest of the year. After a solid—but certainly turbulent—year in 2020, the S&amp;P 500 Index has continued to set new all-time highs in 2021, returning 5.8% in the first quarter.

&gt; “Momentum breeds momentum, but you may not want too much of it,” said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Hitting singles and doubles has historically been the sweet spot for first quarter returns.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, returns between 5-10% have been the “Goldilocks” level in the first quarter, with an average return of 12.4% through the rest of the year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/revised-blog.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Returns through the rest of the year have historically been the worst when the S&amp;P 500 is negative in the first quarter, averaging just 3.1%. However, too much momentum in the first quarter may not be ideal, either. When the S&amp;P 500 has returned more than 10% in the first quarter, returns through the rest of the year have averaged 6.5%.

&gt; 1987 is a year that is often referred to as the year of the “blow-off top,” as the S&amp;P 500 returned over 40% through its peak in August, with over a 20% return in the first quarter alone. This was the only year with a first quarter return greater than 10% that was negative through the rest of the year, but removing 1987 from the data only raises the average to 8.7%, not enough to beat the 5-10% return group.

&gt; # Typical April Trading: Strength from Start to Finish

&gt; Over the recent 21 years April is the top-ranked month for DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000. April ranks #2 S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ. Average gains over the period range from a low of 1.91% by NASDAQ to a respectable 2.30% by DJIA. The first half of April used to outperform the second half, but since 1994 that has no longer been the case. In fact the second half of April is just as strong over the recent 21-year period.

&gt; Early April trading is usually positive for the first 4 days then flattens off around the seventh trading day. At which point, there is just a hint of weakness heading into mid-month. Then the market tends to resume its charge higher through month’s end. DJIA tends to close out the month strongest with NASDAQ closing weakest. This year the market is enjoying above average gains so far this April. NASDAQ is strongest, up 4.40% as of yesterday’s close. Russell 2000 is the laggard, up a modest 0.99%.

180,TSM,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning April 12th, 2021","Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 12th, 2021.

# **Earning season is about to get underway and that could be a positive catalyst for stocks - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/09/earning-season-is-about-to-get-underway-and-that-could-be-a-positive-catalyst-for-stocks.html)**
*****
&gt; The earnings reporting season gets underway in the week ahead, and it is expected to be a positive catalyst that could continue to send stocks higher for now.
*****
&gt; The Dow and S&amp;P 500 start the week at record highs after a strong rally Friday.
*****
&gt; The coming week is packed with Federal Reserve speakers and important data, including a much anticipated inflation reading Tuesday, when the consumer price index is released. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell kicks off another busy week for Fed appearances with a Sunday evening interview on “60 Minutes.” He also speaks Wednesday at an Economic Club of Washington event.
*****
&gt; Powell, in comments this past week, continued to reinforce that the Fed will keep its easy policies in place for a long time, and that any emergence of inflation should be temporary. But hotter-than-expected producer price inflation data Friday has made the consumer price index release Tuesday all the more important. PPI gained 1%, double the expected increase.
*****
&gt; Kevin Cummins, chief U.S. economist at NatWest Markets, said he expects core CPI to rise 0.2% for March, or 1.5% year-over-year, but headline inflation should rise 0.5% or 2.5% year-over-year. Cummins said March is the beginning of a period where inflation could appear greater, just because of the comparison to low levels last year when the economy was shut down.
*****
&gt; “I think the Fed has already moved ahead of it,” Cummins said. He expects CPI to peak at 3.6% in May but then calm down during the summer.
*****
&gt; The other key piece of data in the coming week is the retail sales report for March, which Cummins said could show a 10% gain. The Dow Jones consensus forecast is for a 5.6% gain, following a 3% decline in February.
*****
&gt; Cummins said March sales should be boosted by the $1,400 stimulus checks sent to individuals, which started reaching bank accounts in mid-March. More of the economy has also been opening up, as more people get vaccinated.
*****
&gt; “The back end of the month should be very strong,” he said. “If you look at auto sales, that was the highest level in four years. It seems like restaurants are getting more crowded, with outdoor seating.”
*****
&gt; # Earnings season
&gt; But it may be the earnings season that is the real tell for the economy.
*****
&gt; “It isn’t what they report,” said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. “For the first time, we are going to hear more and more companies now actually making comments about the future. Are they going to upwardly revise some of their outlooks or are they not? That’s what’s really going to be key about it.”
*****
&gt; The big banks kick off the reporting Wednesday, with JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo. Bank of America and Citigroup report Thursday. Morgan Stanley reports Friday. PepsiCo and Delta Airlines are also among the first to report.
*****
&gt; “The consensus for the first quarter is earnings are supposed to be up roughly 22%. We have an easy comp from last year. That number could be closer to 30%,” said Brian Rauscher, head of global portfolio strategy at Fundstrat.
*****
&gt; Rauscher said he expects the most earnings beats to be in the cyclical sectors, like consumer discretionary, financials and materials, all sectors that benefit from the reopening economy.
*****
&gt; “I think earnings season is going to be constructive, and it’s going to be good enough to keep the market going higher,” he said.
*****
&gt; Based on estimates and early reports, Refinitiv now expects earnings growth of 25% for the first quarter. Companies have been beating estimates so far at a pace of 81%. Earnings for the financial sector are expected to be up 76%. The consumer discretionary sector was hit hard by shutdowns a year ago, and its earnings are expected to bounce back by 98%, according to Refinitiv.
*****
&gt; “I think what we’re going to start to see is the operating leverage for these companies is really underappreciated. The earnings are going to start to come back faster than the revenues,” said Rauscher. “Corporate America has really done a good job in the last year of streamlining their operations, their cost structures and everything else. Revenues could come back 50%, and earnings could come back 100%.”
*****
&gt; The major stock market indices were higher in the past week, but small caps lagged with the Russell 2000 losing ground. The Dow rose nearly 2% for the week, ending at a record 33,800, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 2.7% to a record 4,128. The Nasdaq was the leader, gaining 3.1% to 13,900. The Russell was down a half percent at 2,243.
*****
&gt; The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield stayed in the mid zone of its recent range. On Friday afternoon, it was at 1.65%, well below its recent high of 1.77%.

&gt; # As Close to a Perfect Year For Equities as You Can Get

&gt; Every day in our Morning Lineup, we provide a technical snapshot of the market looking at various metrics. One chart we show is the relative strength of stocks (S&amp;P 500) versus bonds (US Treasury Long Bond Future) over the trailing 12 months (chart below). Whenever the line is in the green area, it indicates that stocks are outperforming bonds relative to the start date, while readings in the red zone indicate bonds outperforming stocks. What stood out about the chart in this morning's report was the fact that relative to one year ago (4/1 close), stocks have been outperforming bonds every day since. Sure, there have been periods in between where bonds outperformed stocks (falling line), but from a longer-term perspective, it has been about as perfect a year for stocks relative to bonds as you could imagine.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/040721-Bonds-vs-Stocks.png))**

&gt; The chart below shows the performance of both asset classes individually over the last year. If you think the divide between political parties in the US has ripped wider, it has nothing on the growing divide between stocks and bonds. While the S&amp;P 500 is up over 50%, the US Treasury Long Bond Future is down 14%. If we had to bet on which divide will start to narrow sooner, is there anything closer to a sure thing than taking the stock vs bond divide over the Democrat vs Republican divide?

&gt; # Blowout Q1 Harbinger For More Gains

&gt; Well-above average Q1 gains for DJIA and S&amp;P 500 bode well for continued gains in 2021. DJIA’s 2021 Q1 gain of 7.8% is significantly higher than its historical average of 2.0% and the 17th best Q1 gain since 1949. S&amp;P’s 5.8% gain was also substantially higher than its average of 2.1% and the 19th best since 1949. NASDAQ was the laggard up only 2.8% in Q1 this year, which is actually below its average of 4.1% since 1971 and the 28th best since 1971.

&gt; In any event positive Q1 returns have been a harbinger for continued market gains for the year as whole. As you would imagine, subsequent Q2 and Q3 returns during the Worst Six Months are not as strong as Q4 at the outset of the Best Six Months. As you can see in the tables below, Q2 and Q3 post positive average numbers, but returns are lower than Q1 and Q4 and there are more losers.

&gt; Further gains for the year as a whole failed materialized for DJIA in 1956, 1971, 1979, 1981 1987, 2002, 2011 and 2012 with lackluster performance for the remainder of the year in 1976 and 1992. S&amp;P failed to produce additional gains in 1956, 1981 1987, 2000, 2011 and 2015 with weak gains for the rest of 1971, 1986 and 2012. NASDAQ failed to add to Q1 gains in 1974, 1981, 1986, 1987, 2000, 2011, 2012 and 2018 with paltry showings for balance of 1975, 1983, 1988, 2006 and 2015.

&gt; Overall positive returns for Q1 resulted in full-year gains for: DJIA 40 out of the last 42 times with an average gain of 16.4% (median 16.3%); S&amp;P 41 out of 45 times with an average return of 16.4% (median 15.6%), and NASDAQ 28 of 34 with an average gain of 18.9% (median 17.0%).

&gt; # LPL Market Signals: Raising Economic and Market Forecasts…Again

&gt; On the LPL Market Signals podcast, Equity Strategist Jeff Buchbinder and Asset Allocation Strategist Barry Gilbert update forecasts based on how the economy’s recovery from the pandemic, aided by vaccine distribution, massive stimulus, and the desire to return to normal, continues to surpass expectations.

&gt; Strong March jobs report. The US labor market grew the most in seven months in March, as the economy added 916,000 jobs, trouncing the median economists’ estimate for a 660,000 gain (source: Bloomberg). Segments of the labor market most dependent on in-person interaction saw the greatest gains, notably hospitality and leisure. We expect to see bigger job gains in the coming months, potentially over one million per month into the summer, helping to close the gap on the more than eight million jobs still needed to get back to the pre-pandemic peak.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.7.21-Blog-CHart-2.png?ssl=1)**

&gt; **Raising U.S. and global economic growth forecasts.** An accelerating vaccine rollout, American’s desire to resume somewhat normal lives, and massive stimulus set the stage for booming growth in the U.S. economy this year. Our 2021 U.S. GDP growth forecast goes from 5—5.5% to 6.25—6.75%. A stronger U.S. growth outlook pushes LPL Research’s expectations for growth in emerging markets and globally higher as well.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.7.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1)**

&gt; **Raising our 2021 S&amp;P 500 earnings estimate.** With more economic growth comes more revenue opportunities for corporate America. Companies have been doing a tremendous job of adapting the pandemic, innovating, and generating efficiencies. We are leaving our year-end fair value target for the S&amp;P 500 Index unchanged at 4,050—4,100 for now in anticipation of lower stock valuations as interest rates rise.

&gt; **Raising our year-end target range for the 10-Year U.S. Treasury yield.** Stronger economic growth and more stimulus spending may put further upward pressure on yields. We have raised our forecast for the US 10-year Treasury yield from 1.25—1.75% to 1.75—2.00%.

&gt; # Global Growth Expectations on the Rise

&gt; Before the pandemic we had begun to warm up to international stocks. Valuations relative to the U.S. markets had become increasingly attractive after a long stretch of outperformance by U.S. stocks compared with those in Europe and Japan. We had also anticipated that a weaker U.S. dollar would enhance international stock returns for U.S.-based investors.

&gt; Then the pandemic hit. Since then we have maintained our preference for U.S. stocks over their developed international counterparts. In 2020 the U.S. market benefited from its heavy concentration in technology, digital media, and e-commerce stocks that are well positioned for the stay-at-home and work-from-home environment. More recently, as the Eurozone has struggled to contain COVID-19, our conviction in our U.S. preference has increased.

&gt; “As the end of the pandemic has come closer into view and value stocks do better in anticipation of a full reopening, the environment should theoretically be better for international stocks,” said LPL Financial Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. “But the global dominance of the U.S. market has continued in 2021, in part due to sluggish vaccine distribution in Europe, and LPL Research continues to favor U.S. stocks over those in Europe and Japan.”

&gt; A look at consensus expectations for economic growth around the world supports our preference for the U.S. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, not only is gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the U.S. expected to outpace Europe, the UK, Japan, and the broad emerging markets this year, but the U.S. has also seen the biggest increase in consensus expectations for GDP growth year to date—an increase of 1.9 percentage points to near 6% (source Bloomberg). Earlier this week we upgraded our U.S. GDP growth forecasts for 2021 to 6.25%—6.75%, while maintaining our growth forecast for developed international economies at 3.75%—4.25%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.8.21-Blog-CHart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; The reopening of the U.S. economy amid the accelerating pace of vaccine distribution is certainly a big driver of the increase in growth expectations this year. But massive fiscal stimulus—now over $5 trillion—is another key part of the story.

&gt; The chart below illustrates how massive this stimulus is relative to the size of the U.S. economy (about 26%), and also how much larger it has been than the response to the Global Financial Crisis in 2008-2009. While U.S. stimulus is comparable in size to Europe’s, U.S. stimulus has included more direct payments and spending, and therefore has been more impactful than stimulus in Europe, which has included more loan guarantees.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.8.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; We continue to recommend investors focus their regional tactical allocations on the U.S. and underweight developed international equities. We also recommend a modest allocation to emerging market equities, where suitable, to take advantage of a strong economic growth outlook and attractive valuations.

&gt; # A Goldilocks First Quarter Has Bulls Smiling

&gt; Stocks have kicked off the year in a strong fashion, and history shows this may give reason to be optimistic for the rest of the year. After a solid—but certainly turbulent—year in 2020, the S&amp;P 500 Index has continued to set new all-time highs in 2021, returning 5.8% in the first quarter.

&gt; “Momentum breeds momentum, but you may not want too much of it,” said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Hitting singles and doubles has historically been the sweet spot for first quarter returns.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, returns between 5-10% have been the “Goldilocks” level in the first quarter, with an average return of 12.4% through the rest of the year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/revised-blog.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Returns through the rest of the year have historically been the worst when the S&amp;P 500 is negative in the first quarter, averaging just 3.1%. However, too much momentum in the first quarter may not be ideal, either. When the S&amp;P 500 has returned more than 10% in the first quarter, returns through the rest of the year have averaged 6.5%.

&gt; 1987 is a year that is often referred to as the year of the “blow-off top,” as the S&amp;P 500 returned over 40% through its peak in August, with over a 20% return in the first quarter alone. This was the only year with a first quarter return greater than 10% that was negative through the rest of the year, but removing 1987 from the data only raises the average to 8.7%, not enough to beat the 5-10% return group.

&gt; # Typical April Trading: Strength from Start to Finish

&gt; Over the recent 21 years April is the top-ranked month for DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000. April ranks #2 S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ. Average gains over the period range from a low of 1.91% by NASDAQ to a respectable 2.30% by DJIA. The first half of April used to outperform the second half, but since 1994 that has no longer been the case. In fact the second half of April is just as strong over the recent 21-year period.

&gt; Early April trading is usually positive for the first 4 days then flattens off around the seventh trading day. At which point, there is just a hint of weakness heading into mid-month. Then the market tends to resume its charge higher through month’s end. DJIA tends to close out the month strongest with NASDAQ closing weakest. This year the market is enjoying above average gains so far this April. NASDAQ is strongest, up 4.40% as of yesterday’s close. Russell 2000 is the laggard, up a modest 0.99%.

50,TSM,I built a program that tracks mentions and sentiment of stocks across Reddit and Twitter to find rising stocks! This week's top stock and its DD: Taiwan Semiconductor ($TSM),"**Preamble:** One of the main questions that I had and I see recurring on this sub is how to identify and invest in emerging stocks before it becomes mainstream news. I did not have the time to actively track social media and decided to build a program that does it for me.

**How it works:** The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about the stock is positive or negative).

Here is the stock picked by the program and my DD

**Stock:**   **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company ($TSM)**

Week on Week increase in mentions: **130%**

Month on Month increase in mentions: **324%**

Average sentiment across mentions: **+29.5%**

**DD**

**Core Product**

TSMC was founded in 1987 by Morris Chang, who previously had worked in Texas Instruments. TSMC can be considered as possibly the most important company in the world that few people have heard of. This is because it is practically a chokepoint of the $470 Billion semiconductor industry and is instrumental in supplying chips to almost all the major players. Currently, the company supplies to Apple for their A14 chips and ARM-based chips for their Mac products, Qualcomm, MediaTek, AMD, Intel, and Nvidia.

The company is the world’s largest semiconductor foundry. They are in the pure-play foundry business. This means that they do not produce any processors for their own products but they manufacture and sell chips to companies such as AMD, Intel, and Apple. The main reason for which companies such as Apple and AMD source chips from TSMC is that they do not have to build their own expensive silicon fabrication plants (the CapEx of the plans run into 10s of billions of dollars and it takes an extremely long time to set up) to manufacture their chips. TSMC is currently the world’s 11th largest company by market capitalization ($554 B).

&amp;#x200B;

[TSMC absolutely dominates the advanced chip market ](https://preview.redd.it/qx1btw29krq61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61ce94bf883480c99f5e74a43bdea79bbf9d4d9f)

As you can see from the above chart, TSMC absolutely dominates the advanced chip market (&lt;10nm, think phone processors) which also has the highest margins. The company effectively controls more than half (54% to be exact) of the world’s made-to-order chip market.

**Financials**

TSMC posted its best-ever quarter in Q4’20 with revenues jumping 22% to a record $12.68 Billion and profits increasing 23% to $5.1 Billion. They are also expected to invest heavily this year with capital expenditure for production and development of advanced chips to be between $25-$28 Billion. (60% higher than the amount TSMC spend in 2020)

They also have a very strong financial position with $23 Billion in cash vs a long-term liability of only $10 billion (YE 2020). The company has also predicted a record first-quarter revenue between $12.7 Billion and $13 Billion, which is almost a 30% growth from the same period last year. We do have to note that their share price has jumped more than 140% over the past 12 months giving it the current valuation of $554 Billion.

**Potential and Hype Factors**

**Technology moat:** Compared to peers, TSMC is easily the leader in chip production technology. The company has delivered over 1 Billion 7nm chips by 2020 whereas Intel is still trying to master its 7nm development process. For those who are unaware of chip manufacturing, in general, the smaller the node size (measured in nanometer (nm)), the better the performance and power management. This is why the companies making the top-end chips want the smallest node size available.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w6mw9ehakrq61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a70944796b31b7b971e743f497854c29d9b797d1

TSMC is currently in the process of producing 5nm chips (20% of their total wafer revenue) and is already ramping up for 3nm production by the end of 2022. It takes a long time to spin up a new silicon fabrication factory (3-4 years is the average time it takes for a factory to go from planning to production).

This leadership in technology would be one of the key drivers for growth in the coming years. The $28 Billion Capex spending also reflects on the management’s confidence about the long-term demand for the advanced chips.

**Strong long-term demand:** Even though the current shortage faced by automakers is mainly due to a supply chain issue, cars, in general, are getting more and more complicated and EV’s tend to need better hardware and chips. This will force the automakers to rush to lock in future supply. Even though the margins produced from the auto-chips are not as high as the phones/laptops, the producers of the chips are definitely going to benefit in the long run.

**Risk and Competition**

There are multiple risks associated with TSMC. First and foremost, at the current valuation, the stock is definitely not cheap. The current PE ratio is 33 which puts them in the same bucket as Apple and AMD. While this might be representative of their future growth potential, it is on the higher side for a manufacturing company.

The company might face a short-term crisis in production as Taiwan is currently facing its most severe water shortage in 56 years. Taiwan’s chipmakers have begun stocking up on truckloads of water to prepare for shortages. During a similar drought in 2015, Taiwan was forced to implement water restrictions for industrial companies. This can cause a significant impact on the top and bottom line as TSMC is currently producing at 100% capacity. A weakening USD can also have a significant impact on TSMC’s EPS as \~99% of their sales are in US dollars whereas only 15% of its COGS is in US dollars.

A long-term risk for TSMC is that their increasingly dominant position in chip manufacturing is starting to attract political attention. The current shock from the auto chip shortage is forcing governments to bring vital supply chains back into their countries in order to make them less vulnerable to disruption. In the US, lawmakers are citing the chip shortage as proof that the country needs to revive more semiconductor manufacturing at home. This has forced TSMC to build a $12 billion plant in Arizona. This political climate can be beneficial for Intel, given their current foray into fabrication. (I do not think Intel can effectively compete with TSMC in fabrication without significant help in trade restrictions. As we can see from the process roadmap, Intel is currently years behind TSMC in the manufacturing process and they could not make their products work even when they had the best process technology years back)

**Conclusion**

TSMC is currently one of the world’s largest companies and they are definitely not resting on their laurels. They have been continuously working on building more capacity and advancing their nodes. Even though there are some short-term and long-term risks in terms of their exposure to the US dollar, rising geopolitical tensions, etc., I believe TSMC’s current technological moat, a monopoly level market share in advanced chips, and the rising use of smartphones and IoT devices put TSMC in a very strong position over the long term!

181,TSM,Complete list of this week's trending tickers and top posts from Reddit,"**How can I use this list?**

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. I've displayed the most 'popular' tickers on whichever sub-reddit the post may have originated from. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits. Here's the data from the last week.

182,TSM,Could the semi-conductor shortage be bullish for steel producers?,"Edit: I'm actually looking for *any* non-bullish case for non-chinese steel producers, not just as it relates to semi-conductors. That's just part of my bullish case at the moment.

I'm beginning to think that the semi-conductor shortage could lead a very bullish scenario in the non-chinese steel producer market and I'm wondering if anyone has a reasonable case that non-chinese steel producers will decline or remain flat over the coming year or so. Here is my bull case:

Tensions have been obviously ramping up between China and the Western nations over the last few years and I believe the will be escalating pretty dramatically in the next year. While there is a lot of talk about Uighur and Hong Kong, one of the angles I believe that people are missing is the connection between the semi-conductor shortage and potential serious confrontation between the US and China. Everyone is looking at the semi-conductor play and TSM comes up a lot, but as the saying goes: buy the rumor, sell the news.

The shortage is the news, so what's the rumor?

Well, from what I understand, TSM is incredibly crucial to helping make up the semi-conductor shortfall of western nations, as outlined in [this](https://www.bloomberg.com./news/features/2021-01-25/the-world-is-dangerously-dependent-on-taiwan-for-semiconductors) article. This is very interesting, because it puts Taiwan in a particular position of strength and leverage in dealing with western nations. Why does this matter? For a long time Taiwan has been considered a ""part"" of China per the ""one-China policy"", and the current President stating that she [will never accept ""one country, two systems"".](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan). Further, while I know very little about internal Taiwanese politics, it seems that her party, the DPP, holds a very significant portion of the congress and considers an independent Taiwanese identity a core issue of the party. This seems to put the government of Taiwan in a position of great leverage to demand that the United State, Japan, Australia, Europe, etc, recognize Taiwan as a legitimate, independent nation, separate from China, and with a significant amount of leverage to make these demands. Why would Taiwan sell its semi-conductors to the US instead of China if the the US won't even recognize Taiwanese independence? What is the incentive when their products are in demand everywhere? This isn't even a matter of just being able to make iPhones, a lack of semi-conductors could be a serious threat to nation security (I'm not saying it is, I'm saying it's possible it is).

China, on other hand, seems to be very reluctant to give up it's control of Taiwan stating in 2019 that ""If anyone dares to split Taiwan from China, the Chinese military has no choice but to fight at all costs"" (same Wikipedia article). In fact, I think they have already recognized that Taiwan may use this semi-conductor situation to their advantage and are backing up these words with action. It seems that the Chinese military has been being conducting large-scale military exercises in Taiwanese air space, with someone stating that they are [conducting exercises that would simulate an operation against U.S. warships that sail through the Bashi Channel](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-taiwna-china-security/taiwan-reports-largest-ever-incursion-by-chinese-air-force-idUSKBN2BI24D). And the the US already seems to be taking [its own pro-Taiwanese actions](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/us-taiwan-sign-coast-guard-deal-to-counter-china/articleshow/81702961.cms).

Let's add on to this that generally speaking, the language coming out of western governments hasn't exactly been pro-China lately. The US is talking about [sanctioning](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/22/us-allies-sanctions-china-uighers-genocide-477434) China, and Australia is talking about bringing to the WTO over [unfair trade](https://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news20_e/ds598rfc_21dec20_e.htm).

At this point you might be thinking, ""ok, this is a great lesson in geo-politics, but what does this all have to do with steel?"". The thing is, Chinese steel has been a very contentious issue for a very long time. China produces roughly half the world's steel, and accounts for about [15% of steel exported globally](https://legacy.trade.gov/steel/countries/pdfs/exports-china.pdf), and there have been constant accusations of China dumping excess steel to suppress global steel prices. If you were paying attention during the Trump administration, this was a central focus of the trade war and the tariffs on China.

If tensions continue to ramp up, I don't see why sanctions wouldn't be an order of business, and I could very much see the US demanding that it's allies boycott Chinese products, with steel at the top of that list. Combine this with the fact steel already as already hitting all-time high prices and that Biden is announcing a 3 trillion dollar infrastructure plan, it seems like we are heading into a situation where we will have a growing demand for steel and high material costs, and a potential boycott of Chinese produced-steel which could be a boon to non-chinese steel producers.

While I have read into this, I haven't read into it *super* deeply, so any commentary is appreciated.",15,31,1616900137.0,2021-03-28T02:55:37+00:00,t3_met132,stocks
87,TSM,Adjusting iron condor,"  

Hi all, as a new option seller, I am hoping to have your opinions on how I should proceed with the mess I am currently in.

All the options were on TSM expire on 04/16

I sold a $105/$100 put credit spread on 17/03 when its SP was $118.

A few days later the price was dropped to $108 which made $105 put above 30 delta, that's when I sold a $113/$118 call credit spread for some credit to make it an iron condor which also expanded the breakeven point. 

Unfortunately, the SP went up by 8% just in two days right after I sold the call spread, currently sitting at $116. 

Currently it seems like I have the following options, which one would you do if you are facing the same situation.

* Do nothing and hope the SP will drop, max loss will be $316 with 36% of chance I will not loss any money at expiration.
* Close$105/$100 put spread and sell another another put spred $110/$105 to form a narrower iron condor, max loss will be $266 with 26.74% of chance I will not loss any money at expiration.
* Cloise $105/$100 put spread and sell another put spread $113/$108 to form an iron butterfly, max loss will be $207 with 21.713%  of chance I will not loss any money at expiration.
* Rolling is not an option as it has no chance of profiting and it’s increased the max potential loss.
* Close both spread and accept the 62% loss.

Looking back to what I have done, while I think I made the right decision on selling the call spread, but I didn’t collect enough credit on the put spread, then I didn’t give much space on the call spread is what led me to this mess.

If you don’t mind, please share what would you do when you are facing the same situation or anything I could have done better to avoid this kind of mess going forward.

&amp;#x200B;

183,TSM,"UCTT - DD - an almost ""value"" play in the semi conductor sector?","I know PE is not the main thing when talking about tech/growth stocks, but finding a small cap company in the semis sector with a good PE that is also making good money?

**Customers (👍👍👍👍👍)**

As can be seen in the link below, some of the big names in semis are customers of UCTT (e.g. ASML, TSM, AMAT, LAM, Agilent, SMIC)

[**https://csimarket.com/stocks/markets\_glance.php?code=UCTT**](https://csimarket.com/stocks/markets_glance.php?code=UCTT)

&amp;#x200B;

**Last quarter results (👍👍👍👍👍)**

Q4 revenue increased by 29.1% YoY to $369.6M, setting a new quarterly record for the fourth straight time. Non-GAAP EPS increased by 102.5% to $0.81. The GAAP numbers for Q4 FY2019 got skewed by restructuring charges and other fair value adjustments, which lowered EPS by $0.33 and $0.16 respectively, and resulted in a loss of $0.26 per share.

**Growth (👍👍👍👍👍)**

I will not bore you with the whole details here, but if you are interested you can check at the link below for growth comparison at the sector and industry level

[https://csimarket.com/stocks/growthrates.php?code=UCTT](https://csimarket.com/stocks/growthrates.php?code=UCTT)

some highlights from the link above:

Y/Y growth of 29%, and 5 year average growth rate of 24.4% (for comparison, corresponding values for S&amp;P are -3.24 and 7.37, Tech:7.9% and 12.6%, Semis: 15.9% and 12.8%)

**Profitability (👍👍)**

Also, detailed tables here

[https://csimarket.com/stocks/Profitability.php?code=UCTT](https://csimarket.com/stocks/Profitability.php?code=UCTT)

Some highlights:

operating/net margin is considerably lower than industry (e.g. average 5 year margin of 6% compared to industry average of 21%)

**Market Outlook (👍👍👍👍)**

According to the most recent [world fab forecast](https://www.semi.org/en/news-resources/market-data/world-fab-forecast-report-highlights-q1-2021) report from SEMI, the WFE market is expected to expand by 15.5% to $74.6B in 2021. In comparison, the WFE market grew by 16% in 2020. It is expected to grow by 12% to $83.6B in 2022.

UCTT  has not given a guidance for all of 2021 (except that they will try to beat the WFE market by 10%), which they have managed to do in each of the last 5-6 years. This implies that their target is roughly 25% annual growth in 2021.

**Valuation (👍👍👍👍)**

As of today, the PE is 27.5. At first I thought this was so cheap because I was comparing to the big names in the semis (e.g. ASML: 57, NXPI: 1063 (WTF!),). But comparing to competitors it seems very close in valuation (e.g. ICHR:32, MKSI:27)

However, forward PE seems quite attractive, just 16 for next year (according to [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/uctt/price-earnings-peg-ratios](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/uctt/price-earnings-peg-ratios))

**Market share (??)**

Was not able to get proper information on how the market share is compared to competitors.

**Conclusions ( )**

I like the stock:-)

It is having a great run lately  (17% 1month, 70% YTD, 151% 6M), and still holding well in the tech pullback lately. The company is still only has a 2.1B market cap and provides an essential service to some of the biggest names in the semi-conductor industry. I won't be surprised if this one goes 2x or even 3x the next couple of years.

I don't own any shares yet, but planning to dip my toes in it soon.

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Wednesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/24/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-intel-gamestop-viacomcbs-more.html)

*****

&gt; # 1. Stocks set to bounce after Tuesday’s broad sell-off

&gt; * U.S. stock futures bounced Wednesday, especially Nasdaq futures, one day after a broad sell-off sent Wall Street lower. Investors grew concerned about Covid reopening plans as cases ticked higher in many U.S. states despite vaccinations. Germany and France are among the European nations tightening restrictions again as a new wave of infections sweeps a continent that’s seen a sluggish vaccine rollout. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield on Wednesday continued to back off last week’s 14-month highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 on Tuesday each lost nearly 1%, while the Nasdaq lost more than 1%.

*****

&gt; # 2. Yellen, Powell set for Day 2 of economic testimony

&gt; * Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell are set to deliver a second day of economic testimony to lawmakers as required quarterly by the March 2020 Covid relief act. They will appear remotely before the Senate Banking Committee at 10 a.m. ET. On Tuesday, they told the House Financial Services Committee that elevated asset valuations in pockets of the markets are not reasons for alarm yet. Yellen and Powell also said they’re confident in the stability of the financial sector as the U.S. economy continues to recover from the pandemic.

*****

&gt; # 3. GameStop sinks after acknowledgement of possible share sale

&gt; * GameStop shares fell 12% in Wednesday’s premarket after the company acknowledged in a filing that it’s considering selling additional equity shares. The stock soared more than 2,400% in January’s Reddit-fueled trading frenzy before crashing. It mounted a comeback in late February and earlier this month on hopes for a digital transformation. However, shares in recent days moved lower. After the closing bell Tuesday, GameStop missed on the top and bottom lines with quarterly results. But it did see e-commerce sales jump 175% for the quarter. The company also named former Amazon and Google executive Jenna Owens as its new chief operating officer.

*****

&gt; # 4. Intel to build new chip plants; Amazon names new cloud chief

&gt; * Dow stock Intel rose about 4% in premarket trading after the company said late Tuesday it will spend $20 billion to build two new semiconductor factories in Arizona. The announcement, coinciding with new CEO Pat Gelsinger’s first public remarks since taking over the job, signals that Intel will continue to focus on manufacturing during industry shifts that have led competitors to increasingly separate chip design and chip fabrication.

&gt; * Incoming Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, head of the company’s cloud business for the past 15 years, revealed his Amazon Web Services successor in a memo to employees. Adam Selipsky, a former Amazon executive and currently CEO of Salesforce-owned data-visualization software maker Tableau, was chosen to run the AWS division.

*****

&gt; # 5. Elon Musk says people can now buy a Tesla with bitcoin

&gt; * Elon Musk announced late Tuesday that it’s now possible to buy Tesla vehicles in the U.S. with bitcoin. “You can now buy a Tesla with Bitcoin,” tweeted CEO Musk, who was also officially made the “Technoking of Tesla” this month. People outside the U.S. will be able to buy a Tesla with bitcoin “later this year,” Musk said, without specifying which countries. The electric auto maker in February revealed it bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin. At the time, Tesla said it would soon start accepting the world’s biggest and most popular cryptocurrency as a form of payment.

The stock soared more than 2,400% in January’s Reddit-fueled trading frenzy before crashing. It mounted a comeback in late February and earlier this month on hopes for a digital transformation. However, shares in recent days moved lower. After the closing bell Tuesday, GameStop missed on the top and bottom lines with quarterly results. But it did see e-commerce sales jump 175% for the quarter. The company also named former Amazon and Google executive Jenna Owens as its new chief operating officer.

&gt; # 4. Intel to build new chip plants; Amazon names new cloud chief

&gt; * Dow stock Intel rose about 4% in premarket trading after the company said late Tuesday it will spend $20 billion to build two new semiconductor factories in Arizona. The announcement, coinciding with new CEO Pat Gelsinger’s first public remarks since taking over the job, signals that Intel will continue to focus on manufacturing during industry shifts that have led competitors to increasingly separate chip design and chip fabrication.

&gt; * Incoming Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, head of the company’s cloud business for the past 15 years, revealed his Amazon Web Services successor in a memo to employees. Adam Selipsky, a former Amazon executive and currently CEO of Salesforce-owned data-visualization software maker Tableau, was chosen to run the AWS division.

&gt; # 5. Elon Musk says people can now buy a Tesla with b/itcoin

&gt; * Elon Musk announced late Tuesday that it’s now possible to buy Tesla vehicles in the U.S. with b/itcoin. “You can now buy a Tesla with B/itcoin,” tweeted CEO Musk, who was also officially made the “Technoking of Tesla” this month. People outside the U.S. will be able to buy a Tesla with b/itcoin “later this year,” Musk said, without specifying which countries. The electric auto maker in February revealed it bought $1.5 billion worth of b/itcoin. At the time, Tesla said it would soon start accepting the world’s biggest and most popular c/ryptocurrency as a form of payment.

91,TSM,Best stocks for the fourth industrial revolution,"The Fourth Industrial Revolution is characterised by the fusion of the digital, biological, and physical worlds, as well as the growing utilisation of new technologies. It is the trend towards automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies and processes which include:

* Cyber-physical systems (CPS) / Cyber security
* Cloud Computing
* Ai
* Advanced Robotics / automation
* Big-data
* 3D printing
* Quantum computing (hypothetically)
* Robotic process automation (RPA)
* Semi-conductors
* Biotechnology / Healthcare
* IoT manufacturing
* Renewable energy
* Manufacturing / Mining
* Crypto (I have no experience in this besides some small positions in BTC and ETH, feel free to drop any DD and knowledge)

Of course there's discussions which one are part of the industry 4.0 so I might be missing a few.

since I believe that we are still at the start of this revolution, I want to invest in promising companies related to those industries. Some companies already have proven themselves, others are still in the 'startup' fase.

**Hereby a list of the companies from which I think are the best or will be the best in the corresponding sector. What sectors and which must-have companies am I missing?**

**Note:** some sectors are very broad so they might overlap.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Cyber-physical systems (CPS) / Cyber security**
   * **CrowdStrike - $CRWD**
      * Offers a broad spectrum of solutions with the main goal of cyber-security. Some well-known clients where they have solved hacks are Sony Pictures and the DNC (Democratic National Committee). The company is the market leader in the cloud-based endpoint security segment and is also expanding into 5G network security.
   * **Cloudflare - $NET**
      * Offers a wide range of network services to companies around the world. Cloudflare's intelligent global network spans more than 200 cities in more than 100 countries. It provides network security and improved network performance and reliability to an increasing proportion of the total Internet used. More than 15% of the internet is used via Cloudflare
   * **BlackBerry - $BB**
      * They are working on AI powered cybersecurity
      * They also work on QNX. QNX is a real-time embedded OS that controls software systems in (modern, especially EV) cars and forms the basis of solutions such as BlackBerry Radar, an IoT based asset tracking system for the transport sector.
      * Spark Suites: Spark provides visibility and protection for all endpoints, including personal laptops and smartphones used for work. It uses AI, machine learning, and automation to provide better cyberattack prevention.
   * **SUMO LOGIC - $SUMO - DD from** u/FlynnPierce
      * SaaS platform focused on data analytics and they will likely be the first to be able to call themselves a cloud-native solution for continuous intelligence. To be fair, they themselves pioneer this concept of “continuous intelligence” where companies can have real-time insight and communication with their data.
      * On March 10, 2021 they acquired DFLabs to enhance their cyber security offering, and claim that the SOAR system they inherit from the acquisition is 10x more effective in improving security operations productivity.
      * Benefits over competitors: design and ease of use, scalability and oriented quality.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Cloud Computing**
   * I'll include Amazon and Microsoft since they deserve a spot in this list. But Amazon and Microsoft are already some of the biggest in the world and make all sorts of stuff. It's entirely possible their innovations will be integral to aspects of the 4th Industrial Revolution, but it may also only be a relative drop or glass in the larger bucket that they currently represent.
   * **Amazon - $AMZN**
   * **Microsoft - $MSFT**
   * **Cloudflare - $NET - See DD in previous category**

   * **Intel - INTC - Need DD**

&amp;#x200B;

* **Advanced Robotics / automation**
   * **Teradyne - $TER**
      * Focusses on industrial automation, semiconductor testing, wireless testing and storage testing. Customers are Samsung, Qualcomm, Intel, Analog Devices, Texas Instruments and IBM. **Some of their business units are:**
      * The System Test Group: they build test machines for printed circuit boards and hard drives
      * LifePoint: test machines for manufacturers of wireless modules and consumer electronics.
      * Universal robots: provides collaborative robots (cobots) that work side by side with production workers. UR-cobots automate tasks such as machine loading, packaging, gluing, painting, polishing and assembling parts
      * Mobile Industrial Robots: offers autonomous mobile robots for the management of internal logistics (for loads under 1,500 kg). These robots are currently used in the transportation, healthcare, pharmaceutical, metal and plastics, fashion, technology and food industries.
      * AutoGuide Mobile Robots manufactures modular industrial mobile robots (for loads up to 45,000 kg). These high payload robots are used for assembly, material handling, storage and distribution across multiple industries.
   * **Cyberdyne - $CYBQY - Need DD**
   * **ABB - $ABB - Need DD**

&amp;#x200B;

* **Big-data**
   * **Palantir - $PLTR**
      * This is the way
   * **SalesForce - $CRM**
      * Big data CRM (big data customer relationship management) refers to the practice of integrating big data into a company's CRM processes with the goals of improving customer service, calculating return on investment on various initiatives and predicting clientele behavior.
      * Salesforce is the leader in the CRM sector. Recently, Salesforce has acquired the big data firm “Tableau” for $15.3 billion and Slack for $27.7 billion, adding muscle in its fight with some major leaders. Moreover, the integration of Salesforce CRM and Big Data will enable businesses in analyzing customer patterns and preferences.
   * **SnowFlake -$SNOW - Need DD**

&amp;#x200B;

* **3D Printing**
   * **Desktop Metal - $DM**
      * Co-founders are MIT alumnus Ric Fulop and 4 other MIT professors.
      * They have a new patent called ""single pass jetting"". It takes most 3D printing machines several times to print one layer, Desktop Metal can do it in one go. This makes them by far the fastest in the entire industry (up to 4x faster) - Speed ​​means lower costs, what DM printers can do in 1 day, takes other printers 3-4x that time.
      * They have secured a global distribution network of more than 80 partners in 60 countries offering their Live Parts software as SaaS. Live Parts is an AI software that allows users to automatically generate printable object designs. The program allows users to enter specifications for an object and then create a computer model that can be printed. As a result, they are assured of huge income in addition to their hardware
      * Today, Desktop Metal announced that it launched Desktop Health, a line specifically devoted to healthcare-adjacent products. The line encompasses a number of different technologies, including binder jetting, bioprinting and various materials.
   * **Nano Dimension - DD is from their website**
      * Nano Dimension’s DragonFly System is a one-stop solution for agile hardware development and innovative circuit design across a wide array of industries. It empowers companies to securely control entire development cycles through in-house additive manufacturing of PCBs and non-planar electronics with speed and precision, while reducing R&amp;D costs. With it’s Lights-Out Digital Manufacturing (LDM) printing technology, this is the industry’s only comprehensive manufacturing printing platform for round-the-clock 3D printing of electronic circuitry.
   * **Markforged - $AONE - Need DD**

&amp;#x200B;

* **Quantum Computing**
   * **IonQ - $DMYI**
      * A quick introduction to QC: a normal computer exists of bytes, so 0 OR 1, a QC has qubits, so possibly 0 AND 1 at the same time. In theory this will improve the computational power of computers in a massive way and therefore QC wil be able to solve different classes of problems
      * The qubits that make up QCs are prone to error given the fragile nature of the quantum states. There are 2 quantum states: ion trap (IonQ, Honeywell) and superconducting qubits (IBM, Google). These have about a 0.5% chance of an error during a so-called 2-qubit gate operation ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum\_logic\_gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate)), thus limiting the complexity of the computation you will be able to do.
      * So a lot of research is being done to improve these physical error rates, but an improvement of more than 0.01% seems to be difficult.  This is where error correction becomes important. People have come up with error correction codes that can tolerate error rates and create a much lower error rate by creating what's called a logical qubit. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical\_and\_logical\_qubits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_and_logical_qubits)).
      * It takes a lot of physical qubits to make 1 single logical qubit.  Most researchers believe that with a few hundred to a few thousand very good logic qubits you can solve very impactful problems in the world and thus create significant value.  IonQ expects to achieve this in 7 years ([https://ionq.com/posts/december-09-2020-scaling-quantum-computer-roadmap](https://ionq.com/posts/december-09-2020-scaling-quantum-computer-roadmap))

The news comes amid a worldwide chip shortage that is snarling industries from automobiles to electronics and worries the U.S. is falling behind in semiconductor manufacturing.

The announcement signals that Intel will continue to focus on manufacturing.

Intel stock price broke 52 week high after hr, but amd and tsm are down. I am not sure if intel can really solve the manufacturing long term problem by investing this 20 billion.

**Hereby a list of the companies from which I think are the best or will be the best in the corresponding sector. What sectors and which must-have companies am I missing?**

**Note:** some sectors are very broad so they might overlap.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Cyber-physical systems (CPS) / Cyber security**
   * **CrowdStrike - $CRWD**
      * Offers a broad spectrum of solutions with the main goal of cyber-security. Some well-known clients where they have solved hacks are Sony Pictures and the DNC (Democratic National Committee). The company is the market leader in the cloud-based endpoint security segment and is also expanding into 5G network security.
   * **Cloudflare - $NET**
      * Offers a wide range of network services to companies around the world. Cloudflare's intelligent global network spans more than 200 cities in more than 100 countries. It provides network security and improved network performance and reliability to an increasing proportion of the total Internet used. More than 15% of the internet is used via Cloudflare
   * **BlackBerry - $BB**
      * They are working on AI powered cybersecurity
      * They also work on QNX. QNX is a real-time embedded OS that controls software systems in (modern, especially EV) cars and forms the basis of solutions such as BlackBerry Radar, an IoT based asset tracking system for the transport sector.
      * Spark Suites: Spark provides visibility and protection for all endpoints, including personal laptops and smartphones used for work. It uses AI, machine learning, and automation to provide better cyberattack prevention.
   * **SUMO LOGIC - $SUMO - DD from** u/FlynnPierce
      * SaaS platform focused on data analytics and they will likely be the first to be able to call themselves a cloud-native solution for continuous intelligence. To be fair, they themselves pioneer this concept of “continuous intelligence” where companies can have real-time insight and communication with their data.
      * On March 10, 2021 they acquired DFLabs to enhance their cyber security offering, and claim that the SOAR system they inherit from the acquisition is 10x more effective in improving security operations productivity.
      * Benefits over competitors: design and ease of use, scalability and oriented quality.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Cloud Computing**
   * I'll include Amazon and Microsoft since they deserve a spot in this list. But as @[ArtakhaPrime](https://www.reddit.com/user/ArtakhaPrime/) mentioned: Amazon and Microsoft ""are already some of the biggest in the world and make all sorts of stuff. It's entirely possible their innovations will be integral to aspects of the 4th Industrial Revolution, but it may also only be a relative drop or glass in the larger bucket that they currently represent.""
   * **Amazon - $AMZN**

      * AutoGuide Mobile Robots manufactures modular industrial mobile robots (for loads up to 45,000 kg). These high payload robots are used for assembly, material handling, storage and distribution across multiple industries.
   * **Cyberdyne - $CYBQY - Need DD**
   * **ABB - $ABB - Need DD**

&amp;#x200B;

* **Big-data**
   * **Palantir - $PLTR**
      * This is the way
   * **SalesForce - $CRM**
      * Big data CRM (big data customer relationship management) refers to the practice of integrating big data into a company's CRM processes with the goals of improving customer service, calculating return on investment on various initiatives and predicting clientele behavior.
      * Salesforce is the leader in the CRM sector. Recently, Salesforce has acquired the big data firm “Tableau” for $15.3 billion and Slack for $27.7 billion, adding muscle in its fight with some major leaders. Moreover, the integration of Salesforce CRM and Big Data will enable businesses in analyzing customer patterns and preferences.
   * **SnowFlake -$SNOW - Need DD**

&amp;#x200B;

* **3D Printing**
   * **Desktop Metal - $DM**
      * Co-founders are MIT alumnus Ric Fulop and 4 other MIT professors.
      * They have a new patent called ""single pass jetting"". It takes most 3D printing machines several times to print one layer, Desktop Metal can do it in one go. This makes them by far the fastest in the entire industry (up to 4x faster) - Speed ​​means lower costs, what DM printers can do in 1 day, takes other printers 3-4x that time.
      * They have secured a global distribution network of more than 80 partners in 60 countries offering their Live Parts software as SaaS. Live Parts is an AI software that allows users to automatically generate printable object designs. The program allows users to enter specifications for an object and then create a computer model that can be printed. As a result, they are assured of huge income in addition to their hardware
      * Today, Desktop Metal announced that it launched Desktop Health, a line specifically devoted to healthcare-adjacent products. The line encompasses a number of different technologies, including binder jetting, bioprinting and various materials.
   * **Nano Dimension - DD is from their website**
      * Nano Dimension’s DragonFly System is a one-stop solution for agile hardware development and innovative circuit design across a wide array of industries. It empowers companies to securely control entire development cycles through in-house additive manufacturing of PCBs and non-planar electronics with speed and precision, while reducing R&amp;D costs. With it’s Lights-Out Digital Manufacturing (LDM) printing technology, this is the industry’s only comprehensive manufacturing printing platform for round-the-clock 3D printing of electronic circuitry.
   * **Markforged - $AONE - Need DD**

&amp;#x200B;

* **Quantum Computing**
   * **IonQ - $DMYI**
      * A quick introduction to QC: a normal computer exists of bytes, so 0 OR 1, a QC has qubits, so possibly 0 AND 1 at the same time. In theory this will improve the computational power of computers in a massive way and therefore QC wil be able to solve different classes of problems
      * The qubits that make up QCs are prone to error given the fragile nature of the quantum states. There are 2 quantum states: ion trap (IonQ, Honeywell) and superconducting qubits (IBM, Google). These have about a 0.5% chance of an error during a so-called 2-qubit gate operation ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum\_logic\_gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate)), thus limiting the complexity of the computation you will be able to do.
      * So a lot of research is being done to improve these physical error rates, but an improvement of more than 0.01% seems to be difficult.  This is where error correction becomes important. People have come up with error correction codes that can tolerate error rates and create a much lower error rate by creating what's called a logical qubit. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical\_and\_logical\_qubits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_and_logical_qubits)).
      * It takes a lot of physical qubits to make 1 single logical qubit.  Most researchers believe that with a few hundred to a few thousand very good logic qubits you can solve very impactful problems in the world and thus create significant value.  IonQ expects to achieve this in 7 years ([https://ionq.com/posts/december-09-2020-scaling-quantum-computer-roadmap](https://ionq.com/posts/december-09-2020-scaling-quantum-computer-roadmap))

92,TSM,"Research on Teradyne Inc, a stock seeing an increase in chatter over the last few weeks.","Teradyne Inc, Ticker: **TER (+38% mentions)**

Market cap: $19.5Bn

Teradyne Inc supplies automation test equipment for semiconductors, wireless products, data storage and complex electronic systems in the consumer electronic, automotive, industrial, communications and aerospace sector.

Essentially, the chip powering the phone or laptop you are reading this from has most likely been tested by Teradyne.

Teradynes biggest customers include Samsung, Qualcomm, Nvidia, Intel, Boeing, Texas Instruments, 3M, and IBM.

Don’t have time to read the whole thing? I’ll summarise below

3 main reasons why I like this stock:

* Overall semiconductor market future
* Finances and balance sheet
* Cathie Wood investment

2 possible downsides:

* Low future earnings forecasts
* Recent price volatility

Future

Almost everything requires a semiconductor now, and that will only grow further in the future, some of the biggest examples are:

* The majority of mobile phones sold nowadays are smartphones, and while that growth has slowed down over the last few years, 1.5 billion a year are still sold.
* The ecosystem surrounding mobile phones is growing rapidly, think tablets, smart watches, headphones, laptops, speakers.
* Internet-of-things devices are booming, think Alexa, smart lighting, ovens, fridges,heating, mirrors etc.
* Car technology (especially in electric cars) is mostly driven by semiconductor technology, shifting further and further away from analog technology
* Gaming, from Playstations to VR headsets, again all require semiconductor technology
* Automated manufacturing

Even without COVID, supply cannot keep up. There have been huge shortages this year for semiconductors causing pinches everywhere *(have you tried purchasing a PS5 recently?)* meaning lots of pent-up demand, even without, a number of HUGE factories have been built or will be built that are expected to ramp up supply. examples of those:

* [Samsung’s $17bn factory](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/319926-samsung-files-documents-to-build-new-17-billion-fab-in-the-united-states)
* [TSM’s $12bn plant](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/05/15/taiwan-semiconductor-to-build-a-12-billion-chip-pl.aspx)
* [Intel’s $7bn plant, completed in 2020](https://hexus.net/tech/news/cpu/145990-intel-fab-42-now-ready-pump-leading-edge-products/)
* [List of all current fabrication plants to give you an idea of size of market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_semiconductor_fabrication_plants)

All of this will require automation and testing.

Long-term, it’s very safe to assume that irrespective of economic or technological shifts, semiconductor demand will not only sustain, but surge. A few things on the horizon that will likely affect this:

* 5G technology being rolled out worldwide
* Space technology &amp; tourism growth
* AI &amp; data technology

The biggest kicker? Teradyne provide the majority of the automation and testing for all of these sectors, meaning any growth here only benefits them.

Furthermore, to me they are also proofed from the whole *“economy opening up means a move away from tech“* as it’s not like people will stop using electronic devices, unlike companies like Zoom which will see a big drop in usership as normality returns.

Finances

Even during a COVID year, Teradyne grew revenues from $2.29bn to $3.12bn, an increase of 36%.

They grew their net income even further, going from $467m to $784m, an increase of 67%.

Earnings per share *(profit by number of shares)* also grew, from $2.6 to $4.28 (**+64%**) last year which is astounding. (*general consensus is anything above 25% growth is good).*

When taking the price of the stock into account, and looking at Price-to-Earnings ratio *(Price of the stock vs the earnings per share of a stock, the lower the better)* Teradyne has a PE ratio of 24.9x, which is way better than the industry average of 38x.

From a debt position, Teradyne is very healthy with an equity-to-debt ratio *(the lower the better, below 1 means more equity than debt)* of 0.18.

Cathie Wood Investment

Cathie Wood, the very aggressive bullish investor whos ETF [ARK Invest](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ARKK/performance/) saw returns of 152% last year, [has recently purchased a further 139,619 shares](https://247wallst.com/investing/2021/03/12/cathie-woods-ark-invest-buys-and-sells-3-12/) to add to the current position.

Extra purchasing here shows long-term confidence, as this was added after ARK had to rebalance and sell some Teradyne shares last year.

Possible Downsides

Some analysts are predicting modest future revenue growth at 5.8%, compared to the industry average of 16.2%.

Furthermore, the price this year has seen some large volatility, suffering from the sell-off that affected technology and growth stocks earlier this year. If more sell-offs ensue, this could cause the price to drop further in the short term.

Summary

Teradyne commands a large portion of a market that is only growing further every year. A financially healthy and well managed company, with high revenue and EPS growth, along with some strong investment backing. While there may be some volatility in the price of the stock short-term, long-term this company still has tremendous potential.",43,20,1615986444.0,2021-03-17T13:07:24+00:00,t3_m6zzhm,investing
189,TSM,Is it just me or does ARK look like a pyramid scheme?,"I did really well this year betting on ARKs holdings, but recently I began looking at CathiesArk charts. It seems like every time a stock of theirs began to crash ARK bought to stop the downward movement.  This is especially evident in their top 20 holdings.   


 About a week ARK drastically cut its buying, and liquidated 50% of paypal, all of TSM, and large chunks of several other  stocks.   
Right now ARK is slowly selling off most of its biotech stocks to pay for the slow pump on its top 10 holdings.

I think that one big outflow day and ARK will have to liquidate a ton just to keep its head above water.   


Am I crazy to think that one big outflow could snowball into a rapid liquidation event??

190,TSM,Semiconductor Stocks Sleeping Giant,"With crypto, meme stocks, and reopening stocks highlighted right now, semiconductor stocks are quietly gaining traction. Reminder that domestic semiconductor firms have reached out to the government for aid due to the global shortage of chips. The US govt is currently reviewing and we should see in the next month or two how they'll help. Here's some semiconductors I'm eyeing. I'm just keeping it domestic since I doubt federal aid will go to stocks like TSM.

&amp;#x200B;

MU (Micron Technology)

\- They went out of their way mid quarter and RAISED their guidance for the next quarter. Demand for semiconductors are exploding so they upped their targets across the board.

\- Several price targets raises ( Daiwa Securities 140$, Citi 100$, Cowen 90$)

&amp;#x200B;

INTC (Intel Corporation)

\- Senator Buying.  Senator Carper bought stocks. I like to follow trades like this. Keep in mind a senator bought PENN weeks before the S&amp;P500 announcement

\-  World's leading maker of x86 CPUs for PCs and servers 

&amp;#x200B;

ON (On Semiconductor) 

\- One of the few cheaper semiconductors that hasn't ran too hard yet. Around 38$ right now. 

\- Several price targets at 45+

\- Beat earnings and gave good guidance.

&amp;#x200B;

Other semiconductor stocks could include AMD, NVDA. I personally don't like AMD. It's always burned me and I feel like there's heavy manipulation on that stock to keep it under 100. NVDA is already high priced so itll be hard to run up more but very possible if the treasury yields isn't wack again.",9,20,1615814936.0,2021-03-15T13:28:56+00:00,t3_m5koyh,stocks
191,TSM,My Take on Semiconductors - TSMC DD,"Reports of the [semiconductor shortage](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/538474-biden-to-sign-executive-order-addressing-chip-supply-chain-shortage) in early February had me take deeper look into the industry. Wanted to share my thoughts with the sub!

The market is essentially split into two parts. Companies like AMD, NVIDIA, and QCOM design chips. Companies like TSM, UMC, and Samsung produce them. The shortage here is exclusively on the production side. We can't make chips fast enough and many industries (car makers in particular) are complaining really loudly about the shortage. Some of this is self-inflicted and short-term. Automakers cut back production forecasts because of COVID and rely heavily on just-in-time production supply chains to cut back on costs. This means that they were largely caught with their pants down when demand started to pick back up. 

There are strong longer-term trends driving the shortage here too. Cars are getting more complicated and EVs need more/better hardware/chips. Right now, auto-makers are generally looking at 14nm chips ([Tesla's MCU2](https://onlyusedtesla.com/teslas-media-control-unit-mcu1-vs-mcu2/) is based on the Intel AtomE8000). This is an older process node, Intel was [releasing 14nm chips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Intel_Core_i5_processors#Skylake_microarchitecture_(6th_generation)) in 2015. I think ultimately, car production is going to have to be cut back, prices are going to go up, automakers are going to rush to lock in future supply, and producers (not designers) are going to benefit.

The producer market is really interesting. It takes a LONG time to spin up a new factory (fab). Generally speaking, it's 3-4 years before a factory goes from planning to production. We can't really throw money at this problem to fix this in the short-term. The producer market is also very clearly split into two parts: those who can make 10nm chips and below and those who can't. This [chart](https://s3.i-micronews.com/uploads/2021/03/ILLUS_HIGH-PERFORMANCE-PACKAGING_Overview_SemiconIndustry_YOLE_March2021.jpg) breaks it down at a high level. There are only three companies that can make chips that we'll want in the next 5 years (Intel, Samsung, TSMC), and one of them can't really do it. Intel has gotten 10nm reasonably figured [out but can't break 7.](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-announces-delay-to-7nm-processors-now-one-year-behind-expectations) They've given up the production race and [plan on outsourcing](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-08/intel-talks-with-tsmc-samsung-to-outsource-some-chip-production) their future designs to TSMC and Samsung. 

Between Samsung and TSM, TSM is investing much more aggressively for the future. They've already planning on building out a 5nm production line in Arizona for [\~20K wafers](https://www.theburnin.com/industry/tsmc-increasing-spending-arizona-chip-factory-35b-2021-03-09/) which should increase their global production by 20%. There are [rumors](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/tsmc-arizona-fab-potential-expansion) that they are expanding production to 100K wafers which would double their global 5nm capacity. Samsung is still figuring out [where they want to build](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16483/samsung-in-the-usa-a-17-billion-usd-fab-by-late-2023). It also looks like [TSM](https://www.pcgamer.com/tsmc-3nm-2021-apple-chips/) is going to beat [Samsung](https://www.theburnin.com/industry/samsung-beginning-3nm-chip-mass-production-2022-2020-11-19/) to 3nm by almost a full year. 

That said, the stock is not cheap. It's got a PE ratio of 53. But the steep technological moat, aggressive investment in future production, and long-term demand increases (cars/computers/phones aren't getting any simpler or less popular) makes me confident they'll grow into their price. 

TLDR: We need more chips. TSM makes the best chips.",281,157,1615742166.0,2021-03-14T17:16:06+00:00,t3_m4zabk,stocks
192,TSM,Playing the Chip Shortage,"You can't get away from articles on the semiconductor chip shortage, they're everywhere. Car manufacturers are mad, phone manufacturers are mad, lots of industries are hurting because of it.

So who can solve it?

* TSM

* AMAT

* QCOM

The question is when. I'm heavily invested in all 3 companies here, but we're still on a downtrend due to the shortage.

What are your plans to capture the ramp up in production to get this problem under control?",47,44,1615571731.0,2021-03-12T17:55:31+00:00,t3_m3n2u0,stocks
193,TSM,Why does REGN Trade at 15 P/E?,"Can someone explain to me why REGN continues to go down or in general their market cap seems uncorrelated with their revenues/profits?

Their revenues have grown 16% on average over the last 5 years and have monotonically grown over the last 10 years (I.e. their revenues grow every year). Their EBT is 27-40% which on either end of the interval is quite good. They only trade at 15 P/E where plenty of drug manufactures like JNJ trade at 30.  They have not been diluting shares, their forward looking projections are optimistic, and they are well below analyst price projections (although I don't care too much for that).

They have 9 approved drugs and 8 in phase 3. I assume most won't make it from phase III to being FDA Approved but they appear as through they will be able to get something.  Are all bio stocks just hype machines?  


Overall, I am miffed by the evaluation here but I think it's because I don't know much about pharmaceuticals.  


 

\*Disclaimer   
I do **not** own REGN.   
My holdings are: V, MA, BA, TSM, CRM, SYK, TRVN, ETN, C, HHC, PYPL, TWLO

194,TSM,Question about number of stocks I own on E-Trade,"I've recently gotten into investing with all of the meme stock madness and have learned a lot in a short amount of time, but can't figure out what's going on with my account for the life of me.  I bought 9 shares of TSM last week and sold them at the beginning of this week.  Then upon selling them, my portfolio showed I did not own anymore of the stock, then a day later it showed I owned 3 shares of TSM, but also owned -3 shares of TSM.  I recently upgraded to a margin account, but have never exceeded my non-margin purchasing power.  Does anyone know why this is happening and what I need to do, or will it just resolve itself in a day or two?  I'm asking because I would like to buy more TSM since it's down at the moment.

195,TSM,Value discrepancy across exchanges for Taiwanese headquartered stock,"I've run into stocks listed across multiple exchanges before, but was fuzzy on the requirements/process.

Companies can list on a foreign exchange without a domestic entity, however [investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duallisting.asp) asserts that:

&gt;Considering exchange rates and other complications, stock price should remain the same on both exchanges. If not, an arbiter will bring them together.

Which confused me, until I came across the wikipedia [cross-listing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_listing#Difference_with_Depository_Receipts) article which states:

&gt;...the stock is *technically* fungible between exchanges. Royal Dutch Shell, IBM, and Siemens are all examples where the same issue is traded in multiple markets. However, in Frankfurt and Paris, they are traded in EUR, London in GBP, and on NYSE in USD. Prices are subject to local market conditions, as well as FX fluctuations and are not kept in perfect parity between markets.

Which means there must be comms between the exchanges trading the cross-listed stock, one of which is primary &amp; priced according to market forces, the others on-selling in local currency + brokerage / forex fees.

I checked the top 10 largest public companies in Canada (all of which are cross-listed), and found pricing across currencies to be equivalent with very small discrepancies:

Is it safe investing in TSM?  Could US investors somehow lose their money if something went down?

I was also curious who buys products from companies such as Lam Research, Applied Materials, and maybe KLAC.

Does TSMC use products from any of those companies?

Why doesn't the US manufacture semiconductors is another curiosity I've had recently?

So for those of you viewing this as an opportunity, which one or ones are you considering and why?  I'm considering MU and INTC; MU has a high IV rank and solid fundamentals, INTC has a very low P/E relative to the sector, a juicy dividend, and new leadership.

284,TSM,ARKK (Innovation Fund) Top 5 Stock Picks - Week Ending 3/7/21,"Hey All, each Sunday, I plan to pick 5 stocks from ARK’s funds that are most attractive from a fundamental perspective (i.e. growth rates, margins, valuation). I'm doing this for myself so thought it'd be helpful to share with others before trading begins on Mondays.

Planning to do this for the Innovation (ARKK) fund today, then the autonomous tech next week, then next gen internet, then fintech before the whole cycle repeats. (Unless it turns out that there’s no interest in this, then I’ll stop posting).

**Why ARK?**

* Though ARK’s strategy can be seen as overhyped and controversial, what I do like about the fund is that they are growth-focused with an [internal annual hurdle rate of 15%](https://research.ark-invest.com/hubfs/1_Download_Files_ARK-Invest/Marketing_Material/ARKInvest_122019_ESG-Policy.pdf) based on a 5-year time horizon
* But, I think ARK tends to be on the optimistic end of the spectrum and sometimes ***too*** **tolerant of overly stretched valuations**
* As a result, I’m hoping to give you the **best of both worlds: high growth stock picks at the most attractive prices,** all by using ARK’s ETF picks as a filter for vetted, high-growth companies 
   * To be clear, I’m not saying ARK’s picks are all bulletproof. Just using the fund’s picks since they have a much bigger research team and resources than an individual investor such as myself, so **think of this post as a potential** ***starting point*** **for more research**

**My Process &amp; Selection Criteria**

* First of all, I’ll be excluding all non-tech stocks in my analysis because I personally like to focus on tech. Including healthcare stocks (which pretty much are what the non-tech stocks are) ruins the metric comparisons given the differences in industries.
* My process was pretty simple. Downloaded all the tickers from ARK, pulled data from wallmine or went through filings myself. As a result, there may be some slight discrepancies from the data you use and mine but they should be around the same ballpark.
* Next, my **selection criteria,** which will I’ll likely change over time each week. Today the ones I’m using include the following (data sourced from wallmine and filings):
   * **Trading at less than 70% of the 52 week high** \- provides context around market sentiment
   * **Greater than 25% LTM revenue growth** \- guide for the future
   * **Greater than 60% LTM gross margins** \- operational efficiency
   * **LTM cash flow positive** \- operational efficiency
   * **LTM Revenue multiple of less than 15x** \- valuation
* Given that the market is a bit bearish right now and punishing stocks with stretched valuations, I’m heavily weighting the valuation criteria as you’ll see soon

**The Top 5 Picks of the Week**

* **2U - a leading edtech company**
   * 52 week high discount: 41%
   * LTM revenue growth: 34%
   * LTM gross margins: 71%
   * LTM cash flow positive: 0%
   * EV / LTM revenue: 3.3x
   * Commentary: Most software companies are trading 20-30x with these types of fundamentals, so based on the valuation, 2U seems very promising
* **Baidu - a Chinese AI and internet conglomerate**
   * 52 week high discount: 26%
   * LTM revenue growth: 46%
   * LTM gross margins: 48%
   * LTM cash flow positive: 33%
   * EV / LTM revenue: 4.7x
   * Commentary: Really great financial figures and super low revenue multiple, but do keep in mind that there’s always heightened risk when investing in Chinese companies
* **PagerDuty - an incident response software company**
   * 52 week high discount: 36%
   * LTM revenue growth: 27%
   * LTM gross margins: 87%
   * LTM cash flow positive: (35%)
   * EV / LTM revenue: 13.1x
   * Commentary: The company is in its growing phase so that’s why I’m forgiving of its negative 35% free cash flow margin and a 13.1x revenue multiple seems very fair for this kind of financial profile for a software company. Keep in mind these are EV / LTM revenue multiples, so this multiple is even lower for NTM but I just don’t have that data.
* **Teradyne - a test equipment manufacturing company whose customers include Samsung, Qualcomm, Intel, and more**
   * 52 week high discount: 23%
   * LTM revenue growth: 34%
   * LTM gross margins: 57%
   * LTM cash flow positive: 29%
   * EV / LTM revenue: 5.8x
   * Commentary: Based on the growth rate, margins, and valuation, seems like a bargain
* **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company - primarily makes chips**
   * 52 week high discount: 15%
   * LTM revenue growth: 33%
   * LTM gross margins: 53%
   * LTM cash flow positive: 29%
   * EV / LTM revenue: 11.4x
   * Commentary: The company isn’t trading at much of a discount relative to the others at 85% but I chose this company because there has been some news I came across recently of a chip shortage, which means there is incredible demand for TSMC’s products

**Edit:** One thing I forgot to add - there's obviously a lot more to investing than just numbers. And it's very possible that the numbers I share each week has an important story behind it (i.e. an inflated revenue figure due to an acquisition rather than organic growth). So as I mentioned earlier in the post, please view this as a starting point of research and I'm not necessarily recommending all these as buys. Just that they are attractive from a financial perspective + it helps that the ARK team vetted the company.",127,37,1615162207.0,2021-03-08T00:10:07+00:00,t3_m038nl,stocks

   * **LTM Revenue multiple of less than 15x** \- valuation
* Given that the market is a bit bearish right now and punishing stocks with stretched valuations, I’m heavily weighting the valuation criteria as you’ll see soon

**The Top 5 Picks of the Week**

* **2U - a leading edtech company**
   * 52 week high discount: 41%
   * LTM revenue growth: 34%
   * LTM gross margins: 71%
   * LTM cash flow positive: 0%
   * EV / LTM revenue: 3.3x
   * Commentary: Most software companies are trading 20-30x with these types of fundamentals, so based on the valuation, 2U seems very promising
* **Baidu - a Chinese AI and internet conglomerate**
   * 52 week high discount: 26%
   * LTM revenue growth: 46%
   * LTM gross margins: 48%
   * LTM cash flow positive: 33%
   * EV / LTM revenue: 4.7x
   * Commentary: Really great financial figures and super low revenue multiple, but do keep in mind that there’s always heightened risk when investing in Chinese companies
* **PagerDuty - an incident response software company**
   * 52 week high discount: 36%
   * LTM revenue growth: 27%
   * LTM gross margins: 87%
   * LTM cash flow positive: (35%)
   * EV / LTM revenue: 13.1x
   * Commentary: The company is in its growing phase so that’s why I’m forgiving of its negative 35% free cash flow margin and a 13.1x revenue multiple seems very fair for this kind of financial profile for a software company. Keep in mind these are EV / LTM revenue multiples, so this multiple is even lower for NTM but I just don’t have that data.
* **Teradyne - a test equipment manufacturing company whose customers include Samsung, Qualcomm, Intel, and more**
   * 52 week high discount: 23%
   * LTM revenue growth: 34%
   * LTM gross margins: 57%
   * LTM cash flow positive: 29%
   * EV / LTM revenue: 5.8x
   * Commentary: Based on the growth rate, margins, and valuation, seems like a bargain
* **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company - primarily makes chips**
   * 52 week high discount: 15%
   * LTM revenue growth: 33%
   * LTM gross margins: 53%
   * LTM cash flow positive: 29%
   * EV / LTM revenue: 11.4x
   * Commentary: The company isn’t trading at much of a discount relative to the others at 85% but I chose this company because there has been some news I came across recently of a chip shortage, which means there is incredible demand for TSMC’s products

**Edit:** One thing I forgot to add - there's obviously a lot more to investing than just numbers. And it's very possible that the numbers I share each week has an important story behind it (i.e. an inflated revenue figure due to an acquisition rather than organic growth). So as I mentioned earlier in the post, please view this as a starting point of research and I'm not necessarily recommending all these as buys. Just that they are attractive from a financial perspective + it helps that the ARK team vetted the company.",456,210,1615162141.0,2021-03-08T00:09:01+00:00,t3_m037w1,investing
51,TSM,Chips w/ the Dip: The Semiconductor Market Crash,"You don't get a short version. I'll bold words for you. **$SOXS**. **Put options on consumer electronics.** 

Two weeks ago Biden ordered a 100-day review to address ***supply chain*** issues causing a semiconductor chip shortage in the US. Keyword here is **supply chain**. 

I'm predicting that what comes of this is: the US prioritizes imports of semiconductor chips to what it deems essential: primarily, **automakers**. That is - **not consumer electronics**.

Alright, so some background. Manufacturing of semiconductor chips globally:

1990:  37% produced in the US

2021:  12% produced in the US

2030:  6% produced in the US

The US **can not produce** for the chip demand. You could throw a hundred billion dollars at this problem, and still wouldn't see chip capacity returns for 5 years.

Three years ago, Taiwan (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.) announced it was investing $20b to build a new semiconductor plant. Nov 2019 construction started. Dec 2020 construction was complete (with increased costs due to overtime for construction). Factory prep and production equipment is going to take 12-18 more months, with capacity coming online in Q3-Q4 of 2022 / Q1 2023. **Total time to production: 5 years.** 

[Image from WaPo article; google image search to find the source, not linking it 🖕](https://preview.redd.it/r2bd5puvinl61.png?width=1030&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7085922833647369ead5ed2e352a1b7101ed18d0)

So, all these chips are made in Asia - how is the US going to manage the chip shortage. By limiting imports to specific industries. Consumer electronics are not going to be a priority. 

From the Washington Post (I hate the Washington Post):

The sanctions \[US to Chinese telecommunications giants Huawei and Z T E\] kicked off a domino effect as the Chinese giants stockpiled chips, prompting others to do the same.

“A lot of companies started to hoard”.

A T S M C spokeswoman pointed to the company’s Jan. 28 statement that called addressing the auto chip shortage “our top priority.”

Back to the keyword: supply chain. You might think - oh! Chip shortage, Biden is going to give them an investment. I should go buy US chip companies. No. What about ticker T S M C, the company making that $20b plant, surely their stock will triple. No. Did 3 M Company stock triple with the mask shortage? No. 

Avoided using company tickers that are the opposite of this play. You don't get a short version. I don't know what T L D R means and I won't look it up - in my head I always read it as ""The Long Story, Short"". 

T L S S: **I like my chips with the dip. $SOXS**. **Put options on consumer electronics.**

200,TSM,Best dip buys?,"What are everyone's best dip buys and why?

I'm mainly adding to 2 existing positions: MRVL and ENPH.

MRVL because I think it's one of the more affordable ways to play the semiconductor space right now. I hold AMAT, TSM and ASML also but those are quite expensive right now IMO.
They also just announced an ex-dividend today.

ENPH is the premier growth stock in my portfolio right now. I bought their product, I think it's in a class beyond the other solutions. Growing at insane rates I think even with the PE being on the pricy end the PEG makes up for it. Recent big decline in share price makes it very attractive, it was quite frothy at $200+ but at ~$150 or less I think it's a bargain.

Added to both today in the dip, ENPH at 132 and MRVL at 39.",9,29,1614988307.0,2021-03-05T23:51:47+00:00,t3_lyp64u,stocks
201,TSM,"Should you chase financials and industrials, etc?","i have a heavy tech weighted portfolio and while I'm not overly worried I'm wondering if I should be adding JPM and BAC and more industrials to my portfolio or maybe even just adding to my Total Market index.

I realize people are running scared from tech now due to various reasons and the rising 10 yr.

I'm in it though for at least 10 years or more.  Should I be worried about tech and chasing recent market rotations?  I thought that wasn't the thing to do? I feel like I'd be betraying my tech 😆!!  Just joking.

I also see that on average banks and industrials have been rather bad performers for over a decade.

I realize they're ""beat up"", but why would people be moving their money into banks if they don't return much??

Is it that they ""have no where else to put their money"" when rotating from tech?

I realize also it's mostly the big money or smart money that moves the market and not small timers like me.

So should I just hold my tech?

I'm not just tech though, I'm diversified.

Here are some holdings for example.

203,TSM,Price Isn't Everything- Look at Market Cap,"I have seen many people not buy stocks due to the price being too high or vice versa. I have also seen many people think that stocks will go up a lot because the price is ""relatively"" cheap and has room to grow. For example, I recently read a Reddit Post where the author said that they believe TSM will easily go to a price of $500-600. However, the market cap is already 591 billion meaning they expect they will be more valuable than Amazon or Apple. I am not saying this is not true, but market cap is extremely important to take into consideration.

Apple's current price is $121.26 and Enphase's price is $176.06. Does this mean Enphase is the more valuable company? No. 

A company with a smaller cap has more room to grow than companies with bigger market caps regardless of the price they trade at. For example, it is more feasible that a 1 billion dollar company grows 10X than a company with a market cap of 50 billion to grow to 500 billion. 

If you think a stock is a good buy, don't become too fixated on the price and buy it. On the other hand, don' think a stock is a good deal because it is a low price. There could have been massive dilution.

90,TSM,Long leaps on TSM vs INTC?,"Both have been discussed here with good DD for bull cases for both. 

Considering getting very far out ATM leaps (jan/june 22) for one of them and just leaving it alone until a month or two before expiry when theta starts to eat my lunch. 

From DD posted here I’ve dug out that TSM is more likely to grow than INTC, but because it’s in Taiwan, the market is hesitant to fairly value it due to potential influence if China attempts anything funny. Should be at least a trillion dollar company if it was US based. 

INTC is far from down and out as many are suggesting, and with Rocket Lake out soon it could see a breakout if they smash earnings 2nd and 3rd quarters this year.

So I’m torn which to go for.

Before anyone suggest it I’m not going for AMD, as though it has room to grow, I believe it’s the TSLA of the processor industry. Crazy bubble, but those who can stomach the insane P/E have made mad gains. Not for me unfortunately.",1,21,1614463072.0,2021-02-27T21:57:52+00:00,t3_ltyb8y,options
206,TSM,A Warning About ARK Funds,"Before you downvote: I dont hold a long or short position in any ARK fund or their holdings

This week has been a bad week for tech and growth stock investors in general. The Ark funds have been hit hard and faced some liquidations. Cathie publicly told everyone her plan if faced with liquidations, she planned to sell the megacap stocks so she wouldn't have to touch her illiquid small caps.

Well thats exactly what the ARK funds did this week. As of today ARKK no longer holds any FB, AMZN, AAPL, TSM and BABA. She sold all of it this week and bought more small caps and TSLA. Now ARK is is a very precarious situation. Their biggest stocks are now TSLA, PYPL, SHOP and SQ. If the sell off continues and ARK will be forced to sell these stocks or sell their illiquid small caps.

A lot of people have taken note of this, including hedge funds which may enter predatory shorts if they think ARK is vulnerable. The next couple of weeks is crucial for ARK, should the market go back up they will look like geniuses, but should it go down...they will be in a world of pain.

If ARK is forced to sell the small caps which are illiquid, it will crash the prices and crater ARK's NAV. This will add to the bad performance and may accelerate redemptions creating a death spiral.

EDIT: I was wrong about TSM. They still have .5% TSM",0,212,1614452467.0,2021-02-27T19:01:07+00:00,t3_ltuvbp,stocks

208,TSM,Am I late to the semiconductor shortage play?,"I keep hearing about the shortage of semiconductors on this sub as well other news articles. I have a feeling that since this is already being talked about so much, I've missed the train. Is it worth getting into stocks like TSM, ON, Samsung at this point? 

I really like TSM but I'm not sure if any of TSM or the other companies will be able to ramp up production significantly to get more revenues than they already are? Are there any companies that might be able to jump in and get some market share from big names like TSM in this shortage? Or do you see TSM growing a lot this year too? What are your thoughts? 

I want a start a long position, but just unsure of what company i should root for, it at all i should make this play. Thanks heaps for all the advice :)",30,76,1614273392.0,2021-02-25T17:16:32+00:00,t3_lsbldl,stocks

3,TSM,Trade of the Year: QCOM 01/21/22 Call $135 Strike DD,"This is my first time posting my DD, I am mostly posting this because I really believe in this trade, but I am always looking for feedback and ways to improve my process.

**5G Outlook**

QCOM will be the leader in 5G technology until at least the next generation chips. 5G adoption has [been much faster than 4G](https://wccftech.com/qualcomm-5g-2022-750-million/). In 2019, 5G market revenue was $0.71B in 2020 it had increased to $2.56B with 2021 [projections](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1006994/5g-market-revenue-worldwide/) around $5.4B and $8.75B in 2022. QCOM reported $6.5B earnings in Q4 beating estimations averaging $5.93B, for a 35% YoY increase. The CEO directly stated this was due to 5G.

**Competition**

With their multi year agreement with Apple and the success of the Snapdragon X60 5G in the iPhone 12, it seems like Apple will be sticking with QCOM modems for the near future. I say the near future because Apple’s acquisition of Intel’s modem division indicates they will begin to develop their own chipset at some point.

There is not much in the space of real threatening competition for QCOM right now. The Chinese phone manufacturer, Huawei, designs its own 5G chips and outsources production through Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. , but previously offered QCOM chips in its flagship models. This stopped once the trade sanctions were put in place August 2020 (which surprisingly did not result in a hit to the stock even though Huawei is the worlds biggest supplier of 5G phones).  Huawei's only 5G chip, the Kirin 980, is [blown out of the water](https://nanoreview.net/en/soc-compare/qualcomm-snapdragon-875-vs-hisilicon-kirin-980) by QCOMs most recent 5G chip. As of now QCOM only has a [license to sell 4G chips to the Huawei, which is severly limiting their ability to supply smartphones and driving up the prices](https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/14/21565185/us-qualcomm-license-4g-chips-huawei-ban-china-phones). When Biden inevitably [lifts the trade restrictions he contested](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202101/1214060.shtml), Huawei will become another massive customer of QCOM and may even follow Apple's lead by abandoning their own chip design for QCOMs superior modems as the defualt modem in their flagship models. The revenue from this should be extensive due to pent up demand.

Samsung has historically produced its own modems but QCOM's Snapdragon 888 seems to work [better in Samsung’s phone than their own newest Exynos 2100](https://www.gsmarena.com/exynos_2100_vs_snapdragon_888_sustained_performance_and_throttling_on_the_samsung_galaxy_s21_ultra_v-news-47769.php) and you can currently buy the phone with [either chip](https://www.sammobile.com/opinion/samsung-fans-have-had-it-with-exynos-processors). There is increasing pressure for Samsung to follow suit with apple and almost all other android smartphones and transition entirely to QCOM modems.

QCOM has a ridiculous [patent portfolio](https://www.qualcomm.com/invention/qroniclesofinvention/index.html) and tons of high performing low cost 5G chips available.

This is likely why it continues to dominate its much smaller competitors such as Skyworks and Broadcom. However, one of the more impressive aspects of the portfolio is the large investment in AI. Almost all modern processors take advantage of AI in some way and this will really set the stage for the future of the industry.

If technology innovation follows its historical pattern, 6G will likely not be commercially available until around 2030 and considering the exponentially increasing patent portfolio due to reinvestment in R&amp;D by QCOM, it could be a leader in this as well.

&amp;#x200B;

[Fundamental Analysis of QCOM and Competition \(Purple Estimates are from Yahoo Financial Analysts\)](https://preview.redd.it/7v1s0jbjrcj61.png?width=439&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f9555472846e6d11e14ced4186b25b91caa0caba)

QCOM is currently trading at around $137.12 after the recent volatility and I think it is a great opportunity to look at ITM Call options. It is the most affordable of its competition apart from intel which failed to keep Apple and was forced to [exit the modem industry](https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/227720-how-intel-lost-10-billion-and-the-mobile-market). It also has by far the best opportunity for growth. I think the Yahoo analyst projection is actually conservative.

There is another manufacturer that some people are claiming is relevant, MediaTek. I completely disagree. While it does have 5G chips, they are abysmal compared to everything else. They have very little scalability because they are a penny stock on TPE.

**Price Prediction**

Looking at the price action excluding the spike from the announcement of the Apple agreement in April 2019.

&amp;#x200B;

[Price action analysis of QCOM ](https://preview.redd.it/rajh6u56ocj61.png?width=1687&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73e89cab7db1b5d0ed86106641d41b2b4d8a3236)

It seems likely the price could range from $167.54 in the most bearish case to $258.99 in the most bullish. Giving a heavier weight to the bullish trajectory I believe $225 is a reasonable target at the current rate.

The previous Fibonacci retracement is not comparable due to the onset Covid-19 restrctions and the previous action is not very informative either because there are way too many developments in both the company and market. However, if we assume a retracement back to 0.618 at a price of $125.27 (I think the market will start to turn around due to Powell's testimony).  We should see a bounce late this week or early next week. Since this was a recovery I am expecting a trend reversal around the first Fibonacci extension metric. Which should happen close to year end, in a bullish case it keeps going on to the second metric.

However, since the federal reserve is going to continue to its MMT policies along with the exponential rise in trading, I think 5G companies haven't yet received the attention they could (apart from AVGO), with the S&amp;P sitting at around a 39 average PE, I believe QCOMs PE has a lot of potential for upward movement in this bull market.

If we model QCOMS EPS with a 5th degree polynomial (excluding outliers) to allow for the exponential growth of 5G while hampering growth rate due to slower growth of other aspects of the company, this is the result.

&amp;#x200B;

[Red lines indicate Q1 and Q4 model EPS predictions, the equation of the best fit  polynomial is displayed. The 0.8&amp;#37; Confidence interval is shown as it visually fits the previous data well. ](https://preview.redd.it/8cntgna8ocj61.png?width=1072&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0cb9daa431f121e9876350d9c55e2be1be8c0d3e)

This puts the target price after 2021 at $342.45 ***at its current PE***, obviously the uncertainty is massive though and that is mostly due to the recent price action.

Right now Jan 21, 2022 Calls with a $135 strike are $19.50 bid and $20.55 ask. The theta is currently -0.028 and a delta of 0.588 because it is pretty much ATM with a 36.63 IV. The IV has taken a 17% hit due to what looks like a recent correction, however this was mostly due to speculation about monetary policy, and I expect the IV to bounce as demand increases.

[Date Key for Graphs](https://preview.redd.it/y3ugz6f89dj61.png?width=1554&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43f235f0d720e59f9fb2343771bf8d941cb918e1)

&amp;#x200B;

[IV](https://preview.redd.it/c9dfbfzn8dj61.png?width=1129&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fa87fac5bc93a8d0edbe059951eebd291c85cffd)

&amp;#x200B;

[Vega](https://preview.redd.it/55yibbwa9dj61.png?width=1126&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70ecfac54784eea3fad18e26f0e2de28bf8b81e6)

The vega is at its peak at 0.508 and only slowly declines as the options go ITM while IV sharply rises, I expect a significant premium increase due to this in the rebound.

The gamma is pretty low due to the length of the option and only decreases.

&amp;#x200B;

[Gamma](https://preview.redd.it/7dns6nc0adj61.png?width=1132&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0eec82bccfcce256cc9f2f36166afbd907e0bcbe)

However, despite this, if we saw a return to last week's price delta would increase to nearly 0.9.

&amp;#x200B;

[Delta](https://preview.redd.it/jdtgd4x9adj61.png?width=1125&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04554cc43fde2d69a648da5e6e0cbd7b85b4e6f0)

Thetas look relatively stable until you get 2-3 weeks from expiry and deep OTM.  If you shoot for a pre-holiday sell or roll, and you stay at least above 25% OTM, you are looking at about a 40-60% theta hit to the premium. However, following a vega path in this box, you will see a range from 0.2-0.4 average vega, with IV following correspondingly to the intrinsic value, it could see an average of about 45-65. Thus its possible to offset the theta loss with 2.6 (13%) to 11.2 (56%) \[using $20 premium\] which would average to about a 15.5% premium loss. I think this could even be less however because the rebound will likely be soon.

&amp;#x200B;

[Vega Path](https://preview.redd.it/b2dfpdackdj61.png?width=1124&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=22a6e8109e0910863f5efd91fd0a4e81ed28a27a)

It is pretty clear that the average delta will be around 0.9 assuming it goes in the right direction.

Assuming the greeks follow the ranges above and selling or rolling at the target, in the most bearish case where it enters and follows the pre-Covid price action we can expect a $167 price which would net around a 229% return for the year. If we move to the next most bearish case (Yahoo Analysts) , this would net a 260% return. I think a 350-600% return is most likely though. It is not unreasonable to humor the possibility of a 1000% return on this investment in just one year.  If this stock begins to get more (deserved) attention and the PE starts to rise due to its real future value, this could be a really amazing trade 1000%+. These numbers seem too good to be true, but I invested heavily and have mostly held and or rolled both Apple and TSLA since 2017 based on similar principles, which adds to my confidence in this investment.

The figure below is a precalculated table of contract values, its pretty close to what I have, it seems like the delta curve it follows is a bit different (maybe a predetermined function and not based on the ticker's delta curve).

210,TSM,Taking a closer look at ASE Tech $ASX (5 min read) - Is the stock undervalued? Let's find out!,"## Intro

This is my short and condensed KISS (keep it stupid simple) review of ASE Technology Holding Co., Ltd ($ASX). The basics covers some of the fundamentals, with the figures benchmarked against ASE Technology’s largest indirect competitor - TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Limited) - as indicated by ‘vs.’. Keep in mind that ASE is not a manufacturer of semiconductors. They specialize in assembly and testing, which happens in the final stages of production. TSMC specializes in the early stages of semiconductor production as a manufacturer. They are however both key players in the same industry. Why am I using TSMC as a benchmark instead of comparing against industry averages? Because you don’t benchmark against ‘average’, you benchmark against the top performers in the same industry. The points made inside the bearish and bullish arguments are my interpretations of the company and stock. The summary is my attempt of bringing everything together. I invite you to totally destroy my DD with your best arguments so we can further debug the analysis on this stock. Let’s go!

* Their sustainability practices and principles have resulted in several awards, such as the double A listing for Global Climate and Water Stewardship \[22\].
* ASE has experienced significant growth in revenue and net income. They’re now up by 43% compared to 3 years ago \[12\].
* Very low PE and P/B (price to book value) ratio in comparison to industry leader TSMC \[2\]\[3\]\[10\]\[11\].
* ASE also beats TSMC on short % of shares outstanding, 3 month price returns, and earnings growth - in significant ways \[4\]\[5\]\[8\]\[9\]\[12\]\[13\].
* ASE provides semiconductor assembly and testing services for over 90 percent of electronics companies in the world \[26\].
* In 2020, the Taiwanese economy has outpaced China for the first time in 30 years \[19\].
* Analyst average recommendation rating is 1.5 (between Buy and Strong Buy) \[20\].

## Summary

ASE Technology has a significant stake in the semiconductor manufacturing industry and although they face serious competition, they’ve adapted quite well and are moving towards a leadership role in industry innovation. It’s a growth company, in a growth market, in a growth country. Do they need insanely huge contracts from the likes of Apple? No, and their current growth confirms it as they provide their services to over 90% of electronics companies in the world. In fact, some argue that it’s dangerous to be heavily dependent on a single customer. That being said, their debt to equity ratio is high. Much higher than the industry average. Is this by definition a bad thing? Not necessarily. It might have even scared off some institutional investors, which is fine by me because it means less volatility. But perhaps it's less of a good sign for those who need big money signals.

ASE decided to take on quite some debt. It’s risky for sure but not at a point where there’s red flags. It's not unusual in the manufacturing/assembly industry but it definitely is an aggressive approach. It could be a calculated risk where the current projected revenue for this year will more than cover their debt if reached \[20\]. They will need to make optimal use of their cash flow, which has been steadily growing. Will they reach the projections? I’m of the opinion that they will based on their current growth patterns as well as the tech industry’s move towards more integrated solutions, which ASE is betting on. 

When the car industry experienced a massive chip shortage and companies like ASE were running at full capacity, it became clear to me that this shortage would function as a catalyst that will further prepare and propel Taiwanese semiconductor production to handle higher demand in the future. European leaders like Merkel and Macron are pushing for Europe to develop its own chip industry. But how likely is it that major consumers of chips will go through the trial and errors in Europe, at a high cost, rather than to deal with their trusted suppliers who are innovating as we speak? Perhaps I’m underestimating (or overestimating) matters but when I weigh the bullish and bearish arguments against each other, I can see no valid reason why ASE’s stock is currently so undervalued. I personally like the company's ethics, milestones, growth, and plans for the future.

212,TSM,UMC and AMAT: Thoughts?,"I am trying to identify overlooked stocks in semiconductor sector.

=========

UMC: United Microelectronics Corp

UMC is a semiconductor foundry based in Hsinchu, Taiwan. It started as a spinoff of Taiwan’s national semiconductor research arm and was the first Taiwanese semiconductor to be listed in NYSE. During its early days of foundation, many key figures who later built the TSM success, including Morris Chang, worked at UMC. Late January UMC announced its 2020 Q4 result. Its net profit exceeds NT$10 billion (US$357.1 million) in that quarter, with profits for 2020 reaching a 14-year high of NT$29.19 billion. On Feb.8 UMC also announced its January 2021 net sales grew more than 10% YoY.

Personal pros:

\-UMC is like a miniature TSM, with a lot of support from the Taiwanese gov and a strong footing in global semiconductor foundry business. With most of the money chasing TSM, UMC has the potential to catch up as a lagger.

\-The world is experiencing a severe shortage of automobile chips and even TSM is burdened with a heavy load of rush orders. UMC’s products are heavily demanded by automobile industry. Recently UMC’s executives met with Taiwan gov to discuss speeding up car chips production.

\-Price of UMC stocks now fluctuates between $10-$11. It is already a 400% hike from a year ago but is still cheap enough to buy a large lot.

My personal cons:

\-The majority of UMC’s production facilities (9) are in Taiwan, with three others in Singapore, mainland China and Japan respectively. Strained politics could cause issue for UMC’s product delivery.

\- UMC acquired Mie Fujitsu Semiconductor in 2019 to enhance its indigenous capabilities, but they are still much weaker than TSM and other big names. It is, to its core, a foundry focused on production rather than development. UMC’s most advanced node of production stands at 14nm, while TSM and others have mature 7nm node lines and are advancing to 5nm and 3nm nodes.

==========

AMAT?

I am trying to identify companies similar to UMC but haven’t had much success. The majority of UMC's counterparts are listed in Taiwan, China and HK. I am not quite familiar with the European side, so I looked back at the US and had some thoughts about AMAT.

AMAT is like an infrastructure stock for semiconductor industry. It is the largest global producer of equipment essential to every semiconductor manufacturer and designer, competing against the likes of ASML and Lam Research. Buying AMAT sounds like a sure-win strategy: every winner and loser in the semiconductor business needs its products.

But AMAT is hardly “overlooked”. There are a lot of talks about the company and big money is already chasing the stock after its announcement of better-than-expected results this week. I am thinking about buying some AMAT as a short-term gamble.

213,TSM,TSM - PE Ratio Confusion,"Been looking at this stock and I've come to the conclusion that I don't understand how their PE ratio is being calculated. Currently marketwatch is saying their PE is at 40 with a market cap of about 600B. However, their net income in 2020 is 500B. 

Why is this not valued closer to 1 PE ratio?",3,10,1613759670.0,2021-02-19T18:34:30+00:00,t3_lnmz8l,stocks

214,TSM,TSM - Is it a Buy at $138?," 

$TSM - I am in with a cost average at $102. I first invested in it at $50 but since sold that position was able to re-enter and stayed with my positions at $76 and $103. With 36 shares total I am excited and hopeful this TSM with continue to rally. It even pays a 1.59% Annual Dividend but comes with a small foreign tax fee, my latest tax fee was $.19.

They have purchased land in Arizona for $89 million to manufacture 5nm chips and they expect production can start in 2024 and the project will continue to 2029 with an estimated cost at $12 billion dollars. With expectations of 4nm and 3nm being manufactured by 2022. The P/E is slightly higher than the average with earnings just shy of the average. So your paying a premium but for the largest semiconductor manufacture with a market cap at $715B you also get an advantage in the market with a respectable stock price history, market exposure and a positive future with increasing ability to manufacture more chips in the upcoming years.

I don't think TSM is far away from hitting the $150 and beyond. [Stockinvest.us](https://stockinvest.us/) has price projections near $200 in the next 3 months. I am not too concerned with the timeline but honestly I wouldn't be surprised if it hit $150 next week. I tend to be a bit bullish on TSM and I see this chip shortage being the catalyst that can give us a strong first quarter. With the chip shortage being fueled by the high demand in the auto industry among all the new smart technology devices.

I don't believe investing in TSM or into any position for just 1 reason or even for somebody else's reasons is wise. It's easy to pull up the graph and see the upward trend but I am trying to focus on need for TSM products and the ways they plan on increasing production.

How and if you choose to invest in TSM is up to you. I am long TSM and I am interested in the following as well.

215,TSM,Sectors to watch for in Q2 2021,"Feb.15 is Presidents’ Day and market is closed. With the second quarter of 2021 coming and policies of the new administration becoming clearer, I am looking to allocate my extra cash into a few sectors that I believe will have potentials but are either absent or underrepresented in my portfolio. I don’t talk about popular sectors such as Fintech, online retail, renewable energy, IT and cloud computing, medical and healthcare, online streaming, electric cars e.t.c. simply because I already have picked my stocks and/or ETFs from these places.

======

1 Transportation and Delivery

Transportation and delivery stocks took a hit last March when the disruption of pandemic came. Almost one year later they have recovered strongly. Staying at home and working from home have created unprecedented demand for transportation and delivery of goods via vehicles on highways. As the vaccination looms and the economy reopens, the demand might drop, but the habits nurtured during the pandemic could linger for quite a while. I am still cautious about airline stocks; air travel is still far from recovering even 1/3 of what it was before the pandemic and I won’t make a move until the volume reaches about 1/2 . 

Looking at: PAG, KSU, UPS, FDX, UBER, UNP

======

2 More traditional/” big players” financial stocks

I have opened another post asking for advice, so I will just be copying and pasting:

Fintech stocks and ETFs are popular on the market nowadays and I’ve reaped quite some profits from ARKF, PYPL, SQ, V, virtual currency ETFs e.t.c. But now I am eyeing in on the more traditional/big Wall Street players like Citibank, JPM, Morgan Stanley, BNY, Goldman e.t.c. All flaws and blames and crooked behaviors aside, they are still the biggest players in the financial market nowadays and the establishment can’t be overwhelmed by a few Reddit short squeezes. I am trying to observe if these stocks could sort of ""recover"" from the shock and respond to the innovative trend.

There’s also another realm of more diversified asset management player such as CG, BX, BLK, NTRS e.t.c. It seems the pandemic has a very strong asset/wealth reallocation effects and the wealthiest that could afford to have their assets managed by these players are doing well. These institutions also typically have quite established footings in emerging markets such as Asia and South America in both government and private businesses. CG has recently published a pleasant Q4 2020 report and their stocks climbed. I am waiting to see if BX, BLK and NTRS would follow suit.

Looking at: JPM, BX, BLK, NTRS, CG, BAM

======

3 Military and Defense

The mainstream media tries hard to paint a layer of peaceful color to the new administration, but tensions around the globe won’t just disappear. The US military has quite a few major contracts for new weapon systems delivery coming up, and US arms sales to allies could increase as many of them are located at the forefronts of tensions (Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Saudi, India e.t.c).

Looking at: LDOS, LMT, GD, NOC, BA (more for its military contracts rather than for commercial airplanes)

======

4 Tech Infrastructures

With everything shifting to online platform, Tech stocks (IT, cloud computing, semiconductors e.t.c.) have done well in 2020. I am in MSFT and TSM, and I just want to take a look at stocks that offer a more infrastructural exposure to the tech advancements, such as base towers for 5G, solutions for cloud computing and online platforms, workstations, hardware production e.t.c.

Looking at: CCI, AMT, CSCO, MSI, ERIC

======

5 Virtual Currency

I am not a big fan of virtual currencies so far, and it might be a bit late to enter the game. but nobody could deny the soaring prices of every major virtual currency, and I certainly don’t mind to ride the bandwagon and get a few extra bucks. 

Looking at: BLOK, KOIN

216,TSM,Advanced Micro Devices DD,"**TLDR: AMD has gained market share in every sector and is the market leader in Desktop CPU’s. Lisa Su can do no wrong. They will keep growing while Intel is stagnating for a least 2 years waiting on 7 nm processors. Nvidia is a monster and I hope the EU crushes their ARM deal. AMD is in a really good place to dominate the Desktop CPU sector, gain significant market share in laptops and servers, and take points off of Nvidia in GPU’s. AMD to $120 I think \*shrug**

Hey everyone! I’m just a college student who got bored and wanted to find the fastest way to through away my loans. GME afforded me that opportunity, so now I’m going to try my hand at making money. Or at least analysis. I’ve been following AMD since they released Ryzen Gen 2. Intel had been sitting comfortable in the throne, barely improving chips (how long did they use 10 nm nodes lol?) each generation and hoarding cash because they didn’t have a competitor. Ryzen 2 changed that, Ryzen 3 made AMD the market leader, and I believe Ryzen 4 will solidify it. The difference is even though AMD is at the top, they haven’t slowed down improving their product. Intel got complacent and now they’re paying for it. Pigs.

Fundamentals:

EPS: 20.7

Market Capital: 113.6 Billion

Profit Margin: 25.5%

Operating Margin: 14.02%

Revenue: 9.763 Billion

Total Debt: 572 Million

Free Cash Flow: 777 Million

Let's start off with the easy part. AMD is raking in money. Their margins are growing and their finally feeling comfortable. At the beginning of 2016 AMD's already meager revenue was down 20% to 4.3 Billion, Intel controlled 82% of the CPU market, and Nvidia controlled near 80% of the GPU market. Fast forward to 2021, their revenue for 2020 is 9.8 billion and AMD controls 50.8% of the CPU [market](https://macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMD/amd/revenue). Which is more than Intel if you can't do math. That's a remarkable turnaround, and I think the trend will continue. There's still nobody who wants their gpu's, but that's okay. CPU's are their forte, GPU's are just extra cash. For the most part I will compare AMD, INTC, and NVDA because those two are AMD’s biggest competitors. I’ll start with P/E, it goes Intel last w/ 12.5, AMD middle at 45.5, and Nvidia way ahead at 132. No one has been able to challenge Nvda for Market leader in something like two and a half decades, so this is not surprising. However, AMD’s revenue has increased 45% in the last year compared to Nvda’s going down nearly 7%. Intel’s margin is still slightly higher at 55% and AMD at 45, but AMD just began pricing at a higher cost than Intel, so I expect that to change. There is a large discrepancy in the P/B ratio: INTC at 2.36%, NVDA at 12.56% and coming in at the top, AMD at 19.05%. However, we are in a historic bull run, and [Jerome Powell](https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ALeKk00n6xPgB2VSYgvh3QW6B6IjOz0sUQ:1613338536956&amp;q=Jerome+Powell&amp;stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgVuLSz9U3yIo3LjK1fMRoyi3w8sc9YSmdSWtOXmNU4-IKzsgvd80rySypFJLgYoOy-KR4uJC08Sxi5fVKLcrPTVUIyC9PzckBAK_YEhRWAAAA) said don’t worry about the interest rates, so I won't. Every stock looks overvalued, yet they keep going up, so I think AMD is still undervalued relatively. They beat earning predictions by 10% last quarter, and projected that they grow by 37% vs the consensus of 27% this year. AMD has a measly 113 Billion market cap contrasted to 250 billion for Intel and 370 billion for Nvidia. Yet AMD is still taking market share away in both the CPU and GPU sector. Every time I’ve bet against Elon Musk or Lisa Su I’ve lost, so now I’ll ride her coattail to $110. The stock has been flirting with the all-time high for the last week, and I think it’ll jump to $110ish, retreat back to high 90’s, then climb back to $120 where it will settle. Let's go over the good and bad. In 2016

We all know about the supply issues. It's a widespread issue and no one knows really when it will end. One good sign is Biden committed to signing an executive order to conduct a supply chain review and develop a long-term strategy to avoid future shortages. I’m not sure if it will have any tangible short-term effects on either the stock price, or the supply but I do believe it will increase investor confidence. If the government backs it, it literally can’t go tits up. (To be clear, the government is backing the semiconductor supply chain, not AMD. They could go tits up, but I really doubt it.) Another good sign was at the CES keynote, Lisa Su said they’re expecting “tightness in the first half of the year,” meaning supply will be back to normal in the second half of the year? But take this with a grain of salt because back in early 2020, she said supply would be back to normal by Q4 2020. It’s entirely possible supply will return since covid is receding everywhere except the US. There’s a lot of money on the table right now for whoever can get hardware out. She also said they’re investing in new facilities to avoid this problem so hopefully between the new factories and government intervention their supply chain will be future proof for a while.

I’m not sure where what paragraph to talk about this under, so it’s getting its own. Up until their exemption expired two months ago, AMD was paying 7% tariff rates on certain good from China that most other people had to pay 25%. Biden didn’t extend the discount and he hasn’t committed to repealing or leaving the taxes in place. This will impact their margins significantly.

I think the supply issues are overplayed. Obviously it’s a large issue, but it’s not entirely because the supply has gone dry. There was a perfect storm in 2020 between COVID, the PS5, Xbox, AMD/Nvidia GPU’s, Intel/AMD CPU’s, automobile manufacturers, and the tech industry booming. Covid added on to that. Covid simultaneously caused a significant boom in demand for electronics and disrupted supply.

The Semiconductor Industry Association said sales for semiconductors would rise 8.4 percent in 2021, which is 164% the growth rate in 2020 ([source](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/10/whats-causing-the-chip-shortage-affecting-ps5-cars-and-more.html)). A notable jump when there were 433 billion semiconductors sold in 2020. I’ll do the math for you. That’s 710 billion semiconductors being sold during a ‘supply shortage’ this year. Imagine how many would have been sold if supply kept up with demand. Every device has multiple chips. Chips to control the display, manage power, operate connections, or pick up location. And demand is only going to skyrocket as more electronics/sensors are put into more things. On top of that, short supply is a better problem to have than exorbitant excess of quickly depreciating assets. Trying to guess how much of a product you need is tricky, then when companies realized there weren’t going to be enough semiconductors to go around they all tried to get theirs, and in turn increased the discrepancy between supply and demand. The last cause I felt worthwhile to put in here is the tariff war Trump had with China. Trump bared the biggest foundry in China from getting advanced chip manufacturing gear and barred US companies from dealing with them. This also decreased the supply of semiconductors substantially. China still may have an impact though, they announced that semiconductors will make up a substantial portion of its “Made in China 2025” plan. They are currently aiming to produce 70% of the conductors used in China, the majority through SMIC, and have backed their statements up with billions of dollars. However, they’re still far behind private companies though and SMIC has been successfully sued for intellectual property theft on two separate occasions, the first for $135 million, the second for 200 million, 8% of shares to TSMC with the option to obtain around 10% should they think about stealing again. So, I wouldn’t count on this. Should SMIC find a way to make 7nm chips while it’s still the standard, and get around US restrictions, they could provide relief to a thin supply chain right now and make a lot of money. I don’t think it’s likely it’ll happen soon enough to take advantage of the shortage, but I’ve learned to never count China out when it comes to making money. I’ll keep it here because of the possible impact given they figure it out.

Let’s move on to AMD’s near Future. They just released new chips and GPUs in the second half on 2020, so I wouldn’t expect any largely impactful releases soon. I expect them to finish out their product line with midrange GPU’s/CPU’s. Meh, whatever. What I’m excited about is Zen 4.It was scheduled to release late 2021, and in December 2020 they said they were still on schedule, then early this year it changed to sometime in 2022. I expect it to be early 2022 based on leadership sticking to the late 2021 timeline up until Dec 2020, but this is pure speculation. Leaks have Zen 4 forty percent faster than Zen 3. It’ll probably be closer to twenty-five percent, but I’m welcome to AMD surprising me. Even at twenty-five percent, Zen 4 will once again outclass anything Intel is putting out. Also, this will be the first release where AMD is already established as the market leader. Zen 2 let everyone know they were back, Zen 3 showed that it wasn’t a fluke, Zen 4 should cement that and farther sway market share. It’s being built on a 5 nm process node, something Intel hasn’t dreamed of yet. Intel will be outclassed for at least 2 years, likely closer to 5. They haven’t had to compete in so long they forgot what it was like. [Here](https://wccftech.com/amd-5nm-next-generation-zen-4-ryzen-epyc-cpus-to-feature-over-25-ipc-increase/) is a more detailed map of AMD’s releases in the next two ish years. A lot is unknown about Zen 4 now, but hopefully I’ll make enough money from AMD to get one and I’ll let y’all know how it is. They’ve also bought Xilinx for $35 Billion. Xilinx is a market leader in chips with logic gates. They are entirely different from chips we are familiar with today. They can be altered after leaving the factory. People can use this to specialize their CPU for a task. This show where AMD thinks the future of processors is and by having the market leader in that sector, AMD is already ahead. Not much has been said outside of there being a merger.

AMD has some stiff competition. I’ll focus on the CPU market then move to GPU’s, then smaller markets. There has been a shift toward ARM based processors recently: Apple M1, Qualcomm chips, Microsoft building one currently, and AMD had it in their plans but nothing else has been mentioned. They gave a window from 2017 – 2022, so It didn’t seem that important to them. I don’t see this affecting them or forcing them to switch over. Lisa Su was asked about it and she believes the x86 is still the future, so I’ll take her word for it. Who is Apple anyways? Anyways, arm powers the vast majority of mobile devices and high-powered embedded systems. Arm makes money selling the license to design chips based on their intellectual property. They have tech giants like Apple, Qualcomm, Samsung, and Nvidia all paying for the right, it’s undisclosed how much they are paying though. Maybe if we all pool our money we’ll have enough to partake in the fun. While not too important to AMD currently, it could be in the future. Nvidia announced they were buying ARM late 2020. If they succeed it will allow them not pay licensing fees anymore! In addition, they’re flirting with anti-competitive laws, aka a monopoly. All the companies currently leasing the ARM architecture are under strict guidelines restricting how much can be changes, and thereby restricting innovation. This hasn’t been a problem because everyone one had the sameish rules. Nvidia owning arm would give them control over those restrictions and handicap all other competitors. Should they desire to get into the smartphone market, they could innovate freely while restricting or just outright block others access to arm. Objections have been made based on anti-competitiveness by Qualcomm and Microsoft (lol). The deal is also being investigated by the UK, EU, and probably others. The US congress is on a well-deserved vacation for a while after doing nothing for the past 4 years so we’re sitting this one out it seems. Nvidia owning arm could have some scary repercussions. Since we’re focusing on AMD, if the deal goes through just assume AMD will have 0% market share in the mobile industry. Here’s some quick Nvidia DD, if deal = success: Buy.

On to Intel. According to [techspot](https://www.techspot.com/news/88507-intel-grabs-cpu-market-share-back-amd-first.html), AMD’s x86 market share fell from 20.1% to 19.3% even though the X86 market grew 20.1%. I attributed this to lack of supply. To back this up, consider Intel sales jumped the day after AMD said shortage will last at least several months.(10 minutes, maybe more!) I think people were waiting for AMD to resupply, then when they found out there wouldn’t be stock for a few months, they bought Intel. As a whole AMD’s market share declined .7% in Q4 but was up 6.2% for 2020. Now let's walk through what Intel’s up to. They got a new CEO finally. It was going to be another sears if that didn’t happen. Pat Gelsinger, the new CEO, seems pretty solid. I’m seeing comparisons to Steve Jobs returning to Apple. Pat didn’t start Intel, it’s not his child, so I don’t see how that works. But he could reinvigorate some life. He began as an Intel quality-control tech when he was 18. He got his bachelors from Santa Clara, then his masters from Stanford, all while moving up the ranks at Intel. Not bad. He ended up working at Intel for 30 years, which happens to be how long Intel will be using 10nm processors. Also he was the first ever Chief of Technology Officer for Intel from 2000-2005. I’m not sure what that is and I don’t have the energy to look, but most positions with a C in front are important, or at least well paid. He was the CEO for VMware up until a few days ago, and they seem to being doing well, current stock price of $145, no massive amounts of debt or anything. Nothing wild, stable growth. [Here](https://www.linkedin.com/public-profile/in/patgelsinger?challengeId=AQEEh2JtIcpqrgAAAXei0TxLObNVwusIH5OQIEz5fQ0IhjxFtNNGjXVQUjKWuSrCf6Ys6H8bh0Apq1z-FXymHtqn4g3dC1A4Xg&amp;submissionId=611eae20-25c0-6316-847c-037cbaa1386a) is his LinkedIn if you want to check it out. He takes over Intel on the 15th of February (the day after I’m writing this). The stock went up 11% after the announcement came out, giving a necessary break from the constant stream of bad news out of Intel recently. Pat Gelsinger hasn’t said anything of his plans for Intel outside of “make better products” 4head. I’ve read a few articles that claimed he would pretty much stick to Intel status quo, but I disagree. What’s interesting is he has been offered high positions by Intel between when he left and when he comes back tomorrow but he supposedly he turned them down because he couldn’t change things. Which goes directly against sticking to the status quo. Even still, he’s not God and he can’t make 7nm chips out of bread and water so while he might be the catalyst in an upward trend for Intel on the long long haul, they aren’t doing well now.

Intel plans to release their 11th-generation Rocket Lake Processors as early as mid-March (unconfirmed by Intel, subject to change). This seems positive as AMD can’t supply enough processors so ideally Intel fills this gap. Unfortunately, the chips still suck. Benchmarks have been leaked, [here](https://premiumbuilds.com/comparisons/intel-i9-11900k-vs-i9-10900k-vs-ryzen-9-5900x/) is a “good” comparison to AMD. I’ll summarize for those that don’t want to read. Do your own research people, I could spout some bs right now and you wouldn’t know any better. Anyways, Intel’s best 11th gen is about 20% better than their best 10th gen if the benchmarks are to be trusted. I expect they’re cherry picking which specific CPU they’re benching and giving it every possible advantage. A lot of the system info given on the benchmark is blurred out. I suspect they blurred everything other than the speed, socket, and chip to hide that they blew their budget on their cpu and couldn’t afford a good gpu. Ta da, both me and Intel are using a 1070. (: If you scroll a little bit on the link above you’ll see a “good” comparison to AMD’s last gen chips, I’ve been writing for around five hours and can’t be bothered to summarize, to I’ll just quote it.

Even when it comes to competing with AMD’s Ryzen 9 5900X, which is priced in the range of the i9-10900K, the i9-11900K is about 9% faster in single core speeds. Of course, the i9-11900K will severely lack in multi core speeds, as it is missing four cores and eight threads. Also, if the leaked clock speeds are to be trusted, the i9-11900K will have a significantly faster boost clock speed, reaching 5.3 GHz, versus the 4.8 GHz of the Ryzen 9 5900X. But if we are to compare the i9-11900K with a Ryzen CPU that has an equivalent number of cores and threads – which in this case is the Ryzen 7 5800X – we see that it has a 12% faster single-core speeds, and just about the same multi-core scores.”

I put quotations around good because this is bad. Intel’s next gen chips should not be competing with AMD’s last gen chips. To give an easier frame of reference, here’s an example of how next gen chips should measure up at minimum. I compared last gen i9-9900K (Intel's Best 9th gen chip released Oct 2018) vs Ryzen 7 1800X (AMD’s best 1’st gen Ryzen released March 2017) \*I’m ignoring the Threadripper line because they are targeted at a different, smaller audience. [Results](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare/AMD-Ryzen-7-1800X-vs-Intel-i9-9900K/2966vs3334). As you can see, the i9 beats the 1800x in every category except thread/core count because Intel refuses to move into the future. And this is pretty much Intel’s best processer they will be releasing until 2023. Pat has stated that Intel is figuring out how to make 7nm chips much quicker now but what is he supposed to say? “I don’t know how tf Bob Swan managed to lose this much market share in 2 years when Intel was so far ahead of AMD.” No, he needs to say something that inspires confidence in new leadership. When Bob Swan was Ceo 7nm chips were pushed back until 2023, and I’m not sure Pat has the power to advance a timeline that quickly. They’re taking a backseat until they cough up 7nm processors or tap a different market. To show how confident AMD is in their position, they priced chips above their intel counterpart after making Intel slash prices one-two years ago. They have the superior product and finally have the recognition to act like it. Intel has been relegated to the budge chip for a few years minimum. Because if you think Zen 4 won’t blow whatever Intel is about to release, you’re wrong. Intel will also be releasing Alder Lake in the 4th quarter of 2021. I couldn’t find any leaks or information about it but I assume it’ll be 10nm just like the rest of their chips. For those that don’t know, the smaller you can make the processor the faster clock speeds you’ll get, manufacturing cost go down, and quality improves. A quick example is: Say you have a wafer with 3 defects on it, but you can fit 100 processors on it, because they’re so small. You have 97 usable processors from this single wafer. While if you were Intel you could only fit one processor per wafer, and it’s unusable because there’s 3 defects on your processor. Exaggerated, but gets the point across I think.

One thing Intel has going for them is brand recognition. They were the market leader for more than a decade and did well to establish that. AMD was a great value brand. It will take a while for that sentiment to change, especially with those that don’t keep up with tech.

Last paragraph about Intel. I promise. Last fall Pat said if their factories can’t reliably deliver on processors, he’d consider outsourcing. The only suppliers realistically big enough for this are TSM or Samsung. TSM already makes chips for self-driving cars on behalf of Intel, so advantage TSM. I suspect circumstances have changed though because Pat Gelsinger stated during an earning call on 1/21/2021 that he was “confident the majority of our 2023 products will be manufactured internally.” Given that they haven't started outsourcing, it’s possible. If they do outsource it was result in the loss of at least 30,000 jobs. I don’t know if they care about that though. Extra DD again, if the deal goes through, buy whoever gets it. Maybe buy TSM anyways. Bloomberg [reported](https://www.crn.com/news/components-peripherals/intel-may-outsource-production-of-some-top-chips-to-samsung-tsmc-report) that Intel was in discussions w/ both companies to outsource products starting 2023. (I don’t' have a Bloomberg subscription, so I’m taking crn’s word for it.) Additionally, Intel was awarded a huge defense contract by the US government. Whoever managed that should get a raise. They’ve also entered a three-year collaboration with Sandia National Labs to fight nuclear proliferation and terrorism. Not sure if that’ll make them money or what.

The server market represents a lot of potential for AMD. Intel dominates the market with like 90% market share, but amd’s share increased from 5% to 8% in 2019 and is double digits in midway through 2020. This is the most recent accurate data I could [find](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/16/amd-is-about-to-double-down-on-a-huge-opportunity/). Their current market share doesn’t matter anyways. It’s not about where they’re at right now, it’s about where Lisa Su is going to take them. AMD showcased their 3rd gen server processors named “Milan” by pitching them in a weather prediction simulation against Intel’s Xeon Gold 6258R. The Milan was 68% faster in single-socket performance and 46% faster in dual socket. Now, I know, I know. “Wtf you just bitched about Intel comparing their top-of-the-line next gen cpu with old hardware. Yes I did. I think this is different because AMD blew them out of the water. The presentation was given by AMD, so everything was hand-picked in their favor, but it’s still impressive. If you’re skeptical about it, good. Wait until Intel releases their server chip and see how the two compare. But guess what. The Milan is based on a 7 nm node. It was pitted against a 14 nm node, and Intel’s new server cpu will be ….......10 nm. Morons. If they can take away a significant portion of the server, Intel could start to lose their hold as the staple processor. Who knows what will happen then? Rain upwards? Walk on your hands? Me passing CS? Doubt it.

We can run though laptops quickly. AMD is releasing their 4000 series sometime this year, hopefully it’ll be good. Intel is still entrenched in this market and they have a lot of support from people like Dell and HP who keep putting overpriced underperforming Intel chips in their best computers and limiting AMD processors w/ weaker hardware. But again, AMD market share here went up 10%, so we might be seeing the shift happen. I looked up the best laptops to buy because that what I imagine people who don’t understand tech do. The top 3 on nearly all websites are Mac’s or Intel driven. I think that just shows mainstream sentiment hasn’t changed much. Or maybe I was looking up all my Intel data before then, so then they recommended all Intel. The mobile market followed a similar trend, just imagine everywhere I put laptops it says mobile.

Lastly, the graphics card market. Their 10-K doesn’t say a lot about it or what they plan to do. Just that they are competing with Nvidia, Intel is developing their own high-end gpus. Of topic, but both Nvidia and Intel are trying to break into each other's respective markets. Nothing serious has come out about Intel’s GPU’s so I can’t tell you much about that. Nvidia is the market leader, there is no question in this market. AMD was in the same position vs Intel five years ago, so it’s possible, but hard. Intel slowed down innovating, Nvidia has not. AMD cards also have a bad reputation of being buggy and having bad drivers. Nvidia has a nice program in Gforce and GSync. I don’t see AMD leading this market unless Nvidia hands it to them. However, they have a few things going for them. Competition is good for the industry and I think people realize that after Intel didn't innovate until they were forced to. There's also a large entry barrier, so it's unlikely they'll have to compete with anyone outside of Nvidia and Intel. And I'd give Intel at least a few generations to work out the kinks. It ends up being Nvidia vs AMD for a few years minimum and I believe AMD will take some market share. Not lead, but hold their own.

Consoles were a big win for AMD in 2020. They won contracts to provide chips for both the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. Sales between the two equate to 9-10 billion dollars. However, both console sales have been trending down while Switch sales have been trending up for the past three [years](https://www.vgchartz.com/article/442352/switch-vs-ps4-vs-xbox-one-global-lifetime-salesjanuary-2020/). Particularly the Xbox. I’ve the argument that as consoles catch up to PC performance they will take market share [away](https://www.extremetech.com/gaming/290387-report-20-million-pc-gamers-could-switch-to-consoles-by-2022). I don’t agree with this analysis but I put it in here so you can choose for yourself. My reasoning is:

1. Cross play is becoming common, don’t have to get a console to play w/ console friends,
2. PC has a higher entry barrier usually, but last longer, and can upgrade one or two things at a time for a few hundred dollars instead of getting an entire new system
3. Not that many must-have exclusives anymore (Microsoft punching the air right now)
4. I’m not sure how the Switch fits in, Nintendo is always a wild card to me. Also, the KFC console hasn’t set a release date, but if it does drop I can see the market shifting on its head and going 100% toward KFC. It will be powered by Intel. I’m not actually sure I would want my brand associated with KFC, but Intel didn’t ask me for some reason. That sounds like something a 60 year old guy names Bob Swan would do.

In conclusion, I think AMD will be the market leader in CPU’s for at least 8 years. I think their stock will keep bouncing for a while until the supply squeeze goes away, then earning will come out, Intel will be broke, and AMD will laugh all the way to the bank. There are a few big ifs, the supply chain being fixed, the ARM deal, and figuring out what Intel's new CEO is up to.

if you read all this way I’m impressed. You are very dedicated and I appreciate you because I don’t have anyone else to share all my research with. My roommates eyes glaze over after 30 seconds. It might not flow very well because it was all bullet points before hand. I've put all the sources I could find again in here. I'd love to hear anything I didn't bring up, or contest my points. It's all imaginary money anyways.

53,TSM,AMD and why Sue Bae is giving me a Semi (DD),"
*Processing img 962rkkl28yg61...*

[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en) **- Advanced Mooning Devices** 🚀 have gained +12.8% over the past three months. The Semiconductors industry has seen a rise of +28.7%. Business is good.

*The global semiconductor industry has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the pandemic that turned 2020 into a great year for microchip makers.* 

If you don't know, microchips are an important part of the auto industry, computing, digital cameras, televisions, washing machines, refrigerators and most importantly 5G systems the government is going to use to record your Google searches for 'how to buy a call option' &amp; 'why is my pp small'? 

Exiting the fourth quarter of 2020 with 21.7% of the overall x86 processor market AMD earned an adjusted 52 cents a share on sales of $3.24 billion in the December quarter. On a year-over-year basis, AMD earnings rose 63% while sales climbed 53%. **For the current quarter, AMD expects to generate revenue of $3.2 billion, up 79% from the year-earlier period.** 

*Processing img 6cxhz0qm6yg61...*

AMD had announced its Ryzen 5000 mobile processors in January this year, and the first laptops based on those chips have started rolling out already. So, Intel will have reasons to worry as more Ryzen 5000-based laptops hit the market.

Yes, AMD saw a huge spike in demand for its latest desktop processors that reportedly outpaced supply, forcing vendors to sell older chips. As CEO Lisa ""Su Bae"" pointed out on the latest [earnings conference call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/01/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2020-earnings-call-t/) that the supply constraints were in the ""low end of the PC market."" AKA nothing to worry about.

So with that said it's looking likely that AMD's sequential market share loss was just a blip on the radar that has more to do with the launch timing of its latest laptop processors and a supply shortage. Both things they are working (and have been working) on rectifying in the short term. Chip foundry **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing** ([**TSM**](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) produces AMD's chips. TSM business is killing it, with stock up \~$20 in approx. 30 day window. 

Is it time to ride the lightning and buy AMD? Strong demand for AMD's products and low supply seems like a perfect mix for shares to resume their gains.

TLDR:

95,TSM,Selling Puts to Generate Yield in this Bubbly Market. Talk me out of it!,"Market feels a little frothy and I'm moving to cash. That said I still want to generate income on the idle cash in excess of money market rates (nil). I don't want to touch bonds as rising interest rates will crush long durations bonds and short term bonds are also generating nil returns. Looking for suggestions but am leaning towards selling puts.

My thought is to sell July 2021 puts on AVGO, MSFT, AAPL, TSM. Setting strikes for 25-35% discounts on these stocks would get you a rough return of 3-4% annualized. Nothing spectacular but beats money markets. In the event the market crashes before July, I would be happy to buy any of these stocks at the discount.

Let me know if you have better suggestions for names to sell puts on (without excessive risk) or other strategies to generate yield. I'm not inclined to buy high dividend yield stocks as those will still get dragged down in a market correction and then you are stuck holding them until they recover. I'd rather generate yield now while remaining liquid so I'm in a position to bottom feed after a correction.",40,62,1612928291.0,2021-02-10T03:38:11+00:00,t3_lgl1r4,investing
96,TSM,Second Quarter Results: 6 months into the /r/investing underrated stock survey and the average return was 72% (37% as a portfolio),"Building on a previous post ([http://redd.it/i2thge/](http://redd.it/i2thge/)) asking the community to pick underrated stocks, there was interest in seeing the quarterly performance of everyone's picks

The first quarter can be seen here: [http://redd.it/jti14m/](http://redd.it/jti14m/)

For this quarter, the key takeaways are as follows:

* Overall average return of 72.2% (driven by the GME pick)
* If you invested equally in each stock, returns would have been 41.9%, or if you bought one of each stock, returns would have been 37.5%
* 86% of the 254 picks have shown a positive return, with 80% greater than 10% return and 20% greater than 100% return
* Highest returning pick: Gamestock (GME) at 1342% flagged by  /u/EmployerOfTheMonth, to which they stated *""If it goes up, people will think I'm some sort genius for going against the crowd, if it goes down, people will just mindly brush me off as a moron for actually thinking this was underrated""*
* If you invested in the top 5 most upvoted stocks (NET, CRSP, STNE, NVDA, NOK), you would have seen an average return of 62%
* If you invested in the top 5 most controversial stocks (TSLA, WD, AMD, LMND, UBER), you would have seen a return of 93%
* If you had invested equally in the stocks with greater than 10% return in the first 30 days, your total return would be 53.1%

For those also interested, there was a stock picking survey back in October of 2018.  That overall portfolio is up 58% with an average return of 138% (driven by the triple digit gains in Enpahse and Tesla).  You can see the original picks in my history; happy to provide an update on that one if there is interest.",754,311,1612873399.0,2021-02-09T12:23:19+00:00,t3_lg297f,investing
71,TSM,Low premium in the current bull market,"I am new to thetagang, but I have been selling puts for a while. I feel this is a great place with many valuable discussions and information. 

I am selling \~45 DTE puts at around 0.2 delta (or somewhere close to 1 std dev). I try to buy to close at 75% of the initial premium received and the average trading days is around 25 days. I select my trades from a basket of stocks and ETFs that I am willing to own. e.g. ARKK, AAPL, PYPL, TSM, AMD etc. 

The premium from those stocks and ETFs, however, is pretty low. They are around 1%-1.5% of the price of the underlying. Say for AAPL at the current price of $130, I got less than $150 per put. Even if I push for a 0.3 delta, the premium is somewhere at 2% or less. I understand the IV is currently low for the stocks I selected, but I don't want to trade I something that I am not comfortable owning. Assuming selling put (or sell calls if assigned) is the only trade I do, this will lead to a monthly return of 1.5%. This is subpar comparing to owning the stock at this market condition.

They aren't able to keep up with demand so in the best case scenario is that they raise their prices? And if not then worst case scenario is they maintain their current revenue and profits. Just seems like a safe play to me as there're no reason their financials would be in any trouble. I'd just like to hear some bear cases where you think TSM might go downhill.

219,TSM,Which semi company?,"I’m triming my positions. I have three chip companies and I’m trying to get down to two maybe even one. So which one? I have TSM, QCOM, and NVDA. 

I think the keeper is TSM being that they have had better leadership/past success, they are currently focusing on the auto shortage, they are essentially a manufacturer for others designs and are the go to for big players when they need chips made. So whatever the future holds for chips this is who you go to to have them made. Financials are good with growth across all stages in double digits. 

QCOM is different and tries to make their own designs and sell that. They benefit from the 5G rollout and thats main reason I have them but is that done? Their past isn’t amazing but they jumped a ton in revenue the past two qrt which is expected based on 5G sales. So holding them is really based on the 5G future and I’m not aware of their involvement in the auto, ai, and gaming spaces.

NVDA is just a behemoth of growth outperforming the other two on their financials. They had a bad 2020 but thats one year and debts getting up there but still ok. They have their hands in many areas mostly ai and gaming. Not a question of their future success but rather their valuation. Its gotten about twice as expensive as its historical values so maybe time to dump until later. But this also is valued high because of stock price rising and them having a bad year which is not a big problem for me. 

So maybe someone on reddit can set me straight. Do I dump QCOM and NVDA? Keep one or the other for some reason? Dump TSM and NVDA because I completely missed something about QCOM?",6,7,1612624851.0,2021-02-06T15:20:51+00:00,t3_ldzlt1,stocks
220,TSM,$ON - Possible sleeping giant?,"Hi All, looking for some advice and for folks that are more veterans than I am at trading to give me some feedback on $ON.

Here is what I have found so far that makes me think it would be a good play, please let me know if I am way off here or there are other factors I should be considering.

My current position because I am poor, but plan to exercise and hold: $39.5c @ 0.70 Exp 2/19

With all of the news about the semiconductor shortages and trade agreements, I started digging into the companies like $TSM. One that stood out was $ON Semiconductors due to their automotive sector revenue and recent changes of the guard (New CFO and VP of Operations/Manufacturing and 2 new board members) All of the new guard have a track record of cutting costs and improving revenue and manufacturing.

224,TSM,Dividend investing: Personal Lessons and Prospects,"It’s been a while since I compose any long post on Reddit and wow I can’t remember how many dramatic events have occurred. As a dividend investor I have learned a lot of lessons in the past few months, some with benefits, others costing me money. Just want to share some personal thoughts on dividend equities and things I’ve done to prepare for 2021.

I consider myself a dividend investor and in the past few years I was doing alright. My equities portfolio primarily consists of more established industries with a consistent record of dividend payment, such as manufacturing (especially consumer products and machinery), energy, airliners, hospitality, REITs, retail, military industries, telecommunications, and media. I did buy index ETFs but not a lot. For the sake of safety, my bonds portfolio was mostly US treasuries ETFs with different maturity dates and only a small portion of investment grade and high-yield corporate bonds was included. I also invested heavily in gold ETFs. For the past few years, I reaped a steady 3%-5% dividend each year. I rarely trade my portfolio but whatever I have sold generally also brought realized gains. As of early March 2020, my entire portfolio still had a roughly 25% upside. I can’t say I was doing marvelously in investing, but at least I was happy with the situation. 

I don’t need to mention how the COVID pandemic changed the entire economic and investment landscape. All I need to say was that sometime in March 2020 I witnessed my portfolio turning from 25% up to 10% down in the matter of days. I was not accustomed to frequent trading, so I was shocked and didn’t know what to do. Most established and cyclical industries took a heavy beating, so not only did stock prices plummeted, but dividends were also generously SLASHED. On the other hand, all these up-and-coming-pandemic-benefiting-concept stocks that I totally did NOT understand were soaring through the sky. By the time I came to my senses and figured out what I should do, I was in a situation where my portfolio loss almost equaled all the dividends I’ve earned in the past few years and then some. I was forced to adjust my strategy. I sold stocks that either would not recover very soon or still showing gains to cover the losses, and bought in stocks, ETFs and bonds that were doing alright while still generating good dividend. I did more trading in 2021 than in the past 4-5 years combined. In the end, I still ended up earning some money for the entire 2020, but the majority I have owned was eaten up by my initial losses.

In light of the past and looking forward to 2021, My personal thoughts are as follow.

\-Dividend investing is NOT like high-yield savings account or CDs. You can’t just put money in the portfolio as if you were depositing it into a bank account, then sit back, relax and enjoy the interests. Dividend equities are still equities and hence they are subjected to market fluctuations. Portfolios need to be regularly reviewed and adjusted. I plan to review my portfolios every month in 2021 and seek to sell equities that show signs of fatigue or weakness. I shall also adjust more quickly to sudden market shifts and/or “black swan” events. 

\-Don’t just focus on dividend yield. Yield percentage could be deceiving as declining stock price could produce a higher dividend yield in a short period of time. Instead of “looking for high-yield equities that have good fundamentals and prospects” I switch to “looking for equities that have good fundamentals and prospects that also generate decent dividend yield”. Six sectors in US equities that have rescued my portfolio performance in 2020 were IT techs/cloud services, 5G techs, online shopping, renewable energy, healthcare, and semiconductor/chip production. I am continually investing in these four sectors and picking out good dividend stocks and ETFs. Choices include: NXTG (ETF), IBUY (ETF), IXJ (ETF), ICLN (ETF), TSM (stock), MSFT (stock), CCI (stock/REITs), AMT (stock/REITs).  

\-Sometimes, basic instincts could help a lot. In summer months of 2020, amid the darkest months of pandemic lockdown, I scratched my head and pulled my hair over what sectors I should invest in. Then out of fatigue and laziness I just returned to the basics: What do people need when they are at home? OK, they still need to through trash away, use tap water, and get stuff delivered to their homes. Hence I bought WM (waste management), AMT (water infrastructure), UPS (for delivery) and PAG (transportation). I also had the strange gut feeling that given the drinking culture in this country people would drink more alcohol. So, I bought DEO (Diageo). All five did well in both stock prices and dividends. Of course, the recovery is looming large now and things might change again. However, capturing the trend may not be as complex as those investment talking heads on the media suggest. 

\-Diversification around the globe matters. With the US and Western Europe still deeply mired in the pandemic, some other regions have showed signs of early recovery. Also, with gaps of interest rate exhibiting, some government bonds are more equal than the others. BWX (international treasuries) and DVYA (Asia Pacific high dividend) were two ETFs I used to diversify my portfolio internationally in bonds and equities. They have done well in 2020 and I plan to hold on to them. I am also eyeing ETFs of individual countries such as South Korea, Japan and China. 

\-Finally, I have learned to comfortably admit that I am just not particularly good at investing. I don’t have the skills, heart and time required to be a day trader and I can’t handle more complex products such as options. In fact, had I just sold my entire portfolio in 2020 and invest whatever that is left into either one index ETF of any of the 3 major indexes (SPY, QQQ, VOO…you name it) or my best-performing active management mutual funds (BCAPX), I could have done a lot better. Therefore, I happily yield some of my money to those suckers at Wall Street and let them do the headache for me. I have assigned around 40% of my portfolio to index ETFs and mutual funds and I do not plan to sell any of those in 2021. 

Thoughts, comments and critique are all welcome. Good luck with your investing in 2021!",17,4,1612489143.0,2021-02-05T01:39:03+00:00,t3_lcw4yb,stocks

54,TSM,"DD on $TSM, a play on the auto industry Semiconductor Shortage.","I work at a hyundai dealer, our corporate a month ish ago sent us links to articles about the coming semiconductor shortage in the auto industry. The shortage is forcing many manufacturers to hault or slow productions. This was technically good news for us as hyundai dealer as hyundai manufacturers their own and wont be effected. 

The shortage has affected Volkswagen, Ford Motor Co, Subaru Corp, Toyota Motor Corp, Nissan Motor Co Ltd, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and other car makers. 

But why should we autists care about this shortage, Ticker $TSM. 

Now, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, ticker $TSM has only dipped their toes into supplying for the auto industry. 3% of sales were related to the auto industry in 2020. They are being pushed by these manufacturers to change routes to help supply for this shortage. 

From the article, ""In 2020, auto chips accounted only for 3% of TSMC's sales, lagging smartphones' 48% and 33% for high performance chips.
In the fourth quarter, sales for TSMC's auto chips jumped 27% from the previous quarter, but still only accounted for 3% of overall sales in the quarter."" ""Germany has asked Taiwan to persuade Taiwanese manufacturers to help ease a shortage of semiconductor chips in the auto sector which is hampering its fledgling economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.""
""The ministry told Reuters that it had received requests from both the United States and the European Union through ""diplomatic channels"" late last year, as well as from Germany and Japan this year.""

227,TSM,Is the EV bubble popping and a market correction/crash coming soon?,"I have been a long-term investor of AMD over the past few years and I have been rewarded immensely for it. But a trend I have been noticing for the past half-year is that despite meeting and beating expectations and guidance, high-growth stocks in the semiconductor sector seems to have hit a wall in SP. In particular, I am not just referring to AMD but NVDA as well. On the contrary, stocks with higher earnings but lower growth seem to be regaining momentum, most notably Intel, MU, TSM and others.

This has led me to exit my AMD position and take a serious look at the stock market as a whole. Over the past half-year, there has been an unjustified exuberance in EV stocks. I don't think it takes much convincing to see that the SP of multiple EV stocks (most notoriously TSLA) seem to be out-of-whack with reality and future expectations.

This has led me to think that more rational investors are either exiting the market or moving into stocks with lower growth/risk. If the EV bubble is being propped up by inexperienced investors that are not trading in-line with fundamentals, then a market correction could easily accelerate into a crash for these stocks. And investors moving into low-risk stocks prior to a crash has precedence as well (dot-com bubble). 

One more bit that has me thinking: The GME and related meme stocks seem to be crashing and the shorts and more rational investors seem to be regaining the upper hand. This could serve as a momentum for others to re-look their investments in very risky and overvalued assets. Could this be the trigger for the EV bubble popping?",12,12,1612263521.0,2021-02-02T10:58:41+00:00,t3_lat35z,stocks

Then, I just happened to stumble upon the HSBC MSCI Taiwan UCITS ETF. It is 32% exposure to TSM and 5% each to couple of other solid Taiwanese companies like Media Tek and Hon Hai. It also has ~3% in United Microelectronics Corp which is another solid company! 

I feel like the ETF would be a better choice than going for a single stock in TSM. Does anyone else have a position in either of the two or care to share their two cents?

55,TSM,Bullish thesis for Taiwan Semiconductors Manufacturing,"Semiconductor demand is off the charts right now. TSM is getting more orders than they can fill.

One of the concerns with foundries, from a fundamental perspective, is the potential that the high capital costs with expansion can cause the foundries to be underutilized during periods of dormancy in demand. Which historically may have been true, but as we surge forward as a society technologically, semiconductor demand will only increase and increase and increase with time...computing demands, graphics, autos, IoT, everything...TSM has a wide lead with HUGE barriers to entry with foundries.

Bullish checklist:

1. Incredible demand for semiconductors, unlikely to dwindle soon.

2. Monopoly on market share (54%) / world leading production capacity.

3. partnerships with the best fabless firms, apple, amd, nvda, etc.

4. industry leading in technological advancements - ahead of the game on 7nm, 5nm, 3nm, and 2nm r&amp;d

5. not significant antitrust risk as they focus purely on manufacture of semiconductors and have not been trying to buy out other biz

The main risks imo are below:

1. geopolitical risk, literally getting caught in a war/raid between china/us in the semiconductor arms race. &amp; 

2. intellectual property theft. Something that I don't think would fatal to them considering the barriers to entry with semis.

I'm guessing the Biden administration will provide large support for American companies that make car-related semiconductors right here in the United Stats. This makes sense since EV is going to be a huge priority for Biden. Also we don't want to rely on semiconductors made outside of our country for both supply and national security reasons. 

So which companies have the biggest and best semiconductor foundries in the United States that is making car-related semiconductor chips? (I mean ""make"" as in produce in a foundry and not just design). Or, if there isn't one, who is most likely to be ready to build these foundries?",5,10,1611646559.0,2021-01-26T07:35:59+00:00,t3_l590za,stocks
229,TSM,Now is the time to take some position in the semiconductor big players (specially TSM),"Lately, I have been reading more and more concerns about the demand-supply gap in the semiconductor sector, to some extent driven by  the Trump administration’s actions against key Chinese chip factories.  

Some recent articles:

[https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-55704936](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-55704936)

TLDR:  US/Europe/Japan asking TSM to step in and help them in their chip shortage, and EU is initiating a 30B Euro initiative to increase the EU's semiconductor market share to 20% (from the current value of 10%)

The figure, taken from the Bloomberg article, shows the major players and their revenue and their specialization within the industry

[https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/irHJ0SazJMxI/v1/1200x-1.png](https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/irHJ0SazJMxI/v1/1200x-1.png)

I find TSM and ASML to be extremely interesting among those listed above: TSM for the obvious reasons that are mentioned in the articles I linked, ASML, because they hold the monopoly on the machines that are used for manufacturing the chips. This article from the economist gives a very nice explanation on ASML's dominance and importance:

[https://www.economist.com/business/2020/02/29/how-asml-became-chipmakings-biggest-monopoly](https://www.economist.com/business/2020/02/29/how-asml-became-chipmakings-biggest-monopoly)

And take into consideration this shortage of chips is happening during a pandemic. When we return to normality, hopefully later this year or sometime next year, and add to that the increase in 5G adoption,  EVs, autonomous driving, AR/VR, IoT, etc.. the demand is going increase like crazy.

Thus, I highly recommend those of you who don't have a position in this sector to start nibbling on some shares of the major players.

This list is an inverse of that list and displays tickers where IV is pretty low, thus, purchasing calls will likely be cheaper. For example, AAPL implied volatility right now is almost back to the pre-March lows. Remember a low IV can go lower and a high IV can go higher. Do your DD before entering any positions!

98,TSM,Why do semiconductor stocks follow Intel?,"First I want to say I'm a semiconductor permabull and this is 80% rant 20% question. 

Intel has shown time and time again that they won't get their heads out of the sand and admit defeat with their inferior node. Even with a new CEO, the same old mentality still persists with the company. Their atrocious guidance caused not only their stock, but the rest of the stocks in the semiconductor space to fall. I understand this is only temporary and the other semi stocks will go right back up. However, what bugs me is how this still happens even though it's obvious for over a year now that it's a problem internal to Intel and not an industry wide problem. I remember back in 2017/18 Intel's disastrous earnings always caused AMD to fall. Luckily it changed last year. 

I understand some investors see Intel as a money printing machine, but had they follow AMD for a past few years, they'd learn that most of the revenue were from deals Intel made way back when they forced AMD out of the space with monopolous policies. But that's besides the point. I'm curious what it would take for investors to stop associating Intel with successful semiconductor companies. Like IBM problems don't cause the rest of the tech industry to fall anymore does it? When will this happen in the semiconductor space? 

I have no position in Intel, but I'm long on countless other semiconductors stocks with my top five positions in AMD, NVDA, TSM, MU, and ASML. 

Sidenote: we're in the semiconductor supercycle so semiconductor stocks should vastly outperform general tech stocks this year.",3,12,1611345577.0,2021-01-22T19:59:37+00:00,t3_l2vo95,investing
56,TSM,🚀TSM World Domination: Beyond the moon.,"Don’t call me crazy yet, let me explain.

If you’ve been on this subreddit or know anything about meme stocks, you know about the stocks that have skyrocketed recently. GME, AMD, PLTR, AAPL, TSLA, NVIDIA, CRSR, etc. 

There is a stock that almost all the big tech companies, EV companies, and meme stocks had in common. TSM

If you don’t know what TSM (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing) makes computer chips. You definitely own at least one TSM chip, whether you know it or not. 

Here is a list of a few of the companies that manufacture their chips with TSMC: (from [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSMC#:~:text=Most%20of%20the%20leading%20fabless%20semiconductor%20companies%20such,such%20as%20Allwinner%20Technology%2C%20HiSilicon%2C%20Spectra7%2C%20and%20Spreadtrum.))

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Apple Inc., Nvidia, Intel, Qualcomm, Xilinx,  Altera,Texas Instruments. 

It would take me years to research every single product that TSMC manufactures, but here are a few of the most significant ones that I found:


AMD:All AMD chips are manufactured by TSM any reason to buy AMD is also a reason to buyTSM 
   AMD CPU’s: This also includes AMD Ryzen Processors which are the most bought CPUS on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers-Computers-Accessories-Computer-CPU-Processors/zgbs/pc/229189) As well as the processors that go into many laptops. 
   AMD Graphics Cards: Apple uses AMD Graphics card in their Mac products. They are also in many windows PC’s and laptops, and they are used by miners. 
   Xbox/PlayStation Internals: The PS5 and Xbox Series both use AMD CPU’s and Graphics, which are manufactured by TSM. 

Apple: Apple manufactures All of its processors at TSM. TSM made chips are in every iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, Air Pod, etc. the new M1 Apple in house silicon Macs are also made by TSM. 

Nvidia: Nvidia is the world largest GPU company. They also make self driving processors for Tesla, Nio and other companies. 

Qualcomm: Qualcomm makes Arm processors. Qualcomm processors power everything from Samsung phones to smart TV’s to Amazon Alexa. 

Xilinx: they make most of the 5G processors that go in towers and phones. Samsung Phones use Xilix cellular chips. 

Texas Instruments: they make your fucking calculator. 

There are many many more companies that TSM manufactures chips for. They are also on a more advanced process mode than any other company in the world. Do some of your own research and find out what other products TSM makes. 

See how many products in your life are powered by TSM. 

Chances are, A TSM manufactured chip could be inside your phone, your computer, your TV, your smart speaker and other smart home devices, your wifi router, your cars radio/gps, your cars self driving system (if your car has it). Your wireless headphones, the cell tower in your neighborhood. Even your calculator.

The “cloud” is also powered by TSM. The servers that google, Amazon, one drive, Spotify, Palantir, etc. 

If you can find just one area of technology that does not, at some point, use TSM manufacturing, comment it below. 

If you can’t then buy some fucking shares. 🚀🚀🚀",30,19,1611335309.0,2021-01-22T17:08:29+00:00,t3_l2s1px,wallstreetbets
230,TSM,Semiconductor Market,"I would like to get some insight on the market for semiconductors. It has been a monumental year for companies like AMD, NVIDIA, TSM, etc. Over the last week the news and market seemed bearish in the short term on these companies. You could argue that the success is baked in and they are in need of a correction but I have read numerous articles about there being a semiconductor shortage with the rise of cloud computing, bitcoin, and EV. Shouldn't this skyrocket semiconductor stocks in the anticipation of the booming sales and revenue coming down the line? Am I looking too short term?",20,36,1611028796.0,2021-01-19T03:59:56+00:00,t3_l0bon9,stocks
231,TSM,ARKF vs MELI?,"I recently was going over my positions and realized I actually held a lot of the top holdings currently in ARKF as individual positions. I have around 6-8% of my portfolio each in PINS, SE, SQ and around 5% in ARKF. I’m realizing this is a lot of overlap so I’m a bit confused on what to do. 

I really like MELI as a future growth stock, as well as some international exposure. However I do already hold SE and AMZN (and somewhat PINS) in e-commerce so I’m a bit concerned on having too many positions in the same industry. 

Other options would be to keep ARKF as it is, or distribute it among my other ARK holdings (Q and G), or open a new position like MELI or TSM. 

What would you guys recommend?",2,7,1610894763.0,2021-01-17T14:46:03+00:00,t3_kz7nds,stocks
4,TSM,IV Report - Tickers with low IV and cheaper premiums,"What's up fellas at r/options. I made a tool called [FD Ranker](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/fd-ranker) that logs the average IV of popular tickers. The tool is inclusive of almost 1,000 tickers now.

265,TSM,"Daily Market Recap - Thursday, January 14, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, January 14, 2021**

After the Dow and Nasdaq briefly reached new intraday highs, the stock market pared its gains to end slightly lower today. Market participants continue to monitor the political situation in Washington D.C. and the coronavirus pandemic.

In Washington, members of the House of Representatives, including 10 Republicans, voted to impeach Donald Trump for the second time, making him the only president in history to be impeached twice. Current Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he would not call back members of the Senate back into session early before January 19 to hold the impeachment trial. This suggests Trump will serve out his remaining time in office before President-Elect Biden takes over. The trial, which accuses Trump of “inciting an insurrection” can still take place after he leaves office. 

Despite early warnings from analysts that a unified Democratic government would be bad for the market, the market has performed remarkably well since Biden’s victory. It seems the prospect of additional fiscal relief under the Democrats and the Federal Reserve’s commitment to keeping rates low and maintaining its program of asset purchasing have buoyed equities despite the surging coronavirus pandemic. Later today, President-Elect Biden is expected to unveil some of the details of an additional virus-relief package. Jason Ware, chief investment officer for Albion Financial Group said, “As we look at the new administration in Washington and a Congress that’s tilted toward the Democrats, we do expect more stimulus to come down the line. It’s probably not going to happen over the next couple of weeks, but certainly, by the spring an extension of unemployment benefits for those who are still out of work, maybe a boost to what they’re getting on a weekly basis, and fresh stimulus checks closer to $2,000 might be something that has an appetite in Washington.”

The Trump administration announced sweeping changes to its vaccination rollout on Tuesday, including making all of the coronavirus vaccine supply immediately available, urging states to provide shots to anyone 65 and older, and warning states with lagging inoculations that they could lose some of their shots to speedier places. The plan is an effort to speed up the rollout of the vaccine, which has so far lagged behind promises. The US recorded 3,848 deaths on Wednesday, down from an all-time high of 4,327 the day before, according to Johns Hopkins University. The nation now has over 23.2 million infections and a death toll of over 385,000.

78,TSM,IV Report - Tickers with low IV and cheaper premiums,"What's up fellas at smallstreetbets. I made a tool called [FD Ranker](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/fd-ranker) that logs the average IV of popular tickers. The tool is inclusive of almost 1,000 tickers now.

**What is this tool good for**

I posted in ThetaGang the list with HIGH IV options which is great for running the wheel or selling options. This list is an inverse of that list and displays tickers where IV is pretty low, thus, purchasing calls will likely be cheaper. For example, AAPL implied volatility right now is almost back to the pre-March lows. Remember a low IV can go lower and a high IV can go higher. Do your DD before entering any positions!

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 11th, 2021.

# **Markets face a big week of news, with stimulus at the top of the list  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/08/markets-face-a-big-week-of-news-with-stimulus-at-the-top-of-the-list.html)**
*****
&gt; Markets will stay laser-focused on the prospect for more fiscal stimulus in the busy week ahead.
*****
&gt; Politics and politicians are likely to continue dominating the headlines, as Democrats seek President Donald Trump’s removal after a mob of his followers took over the Capitol Building on Wednesday.
*****
&gt; But it is stimulus that should get the most attention from investors, who are betting the new Democratic majority in Congress will move quickly and that it could consider a package of $1 trillion or more.
*****
&gt; Stocks rose to record highs in the past week, boosted in large part by the idea of a bigger stimulus package.
*****
&gt; With Democrats now in control of the Senate and House, the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden is expected to deliver an even bigger stimulus package than had been expected with a divided Congress. Biden said Friday the total will be in “the trillions of dollars.” The election Tuesday of two Georgia Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, shifted control of the Senate to Democrats.
*****
&gt; While disturbing, the temporary assault on the Capitol Building did not ruffle markets, and the removal of Trump is not expected to receive enough Republican support to succeed with just days remaining in his term. Biden is scheduled to be sworn in on Jan. 20.
*****
&gt; “The market is willing to look through that chaos, but not through this anticipation of faster and bigger stimulus,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities.
*****
&gt; # Earnings, data ahead
In the normal business of markets, fourth-quarter earnings season begins with the rollout of big banks’ reports Friday, when JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo on tap. There is also a long list of Fed speakers including Chairman Jerome Powell, who is scheduled for a webcast from Princeton University Thursday.

&gt; On the data front, CPI inflation data is released Wednesday and December’s retail sales are reported Friday.
*****
&gt; The consumer price index will be important, and although it is expected to show muted inflation, markets have begun to price in rising expectations in the bond market. One bond market inflation measure, the 10-year breakeven, went as high as 2.1% Thursday, meaning investors expect that to be the average level of inflation over the next 10 years.
*****
&gt; But strategists said little will matter but stimulus, which economists expect will ease the impact of the surging virus on the economy. The U.S. reported more than 4,000 deaths from Covid in one day for the first time Friday.
*****
&gt; The stock market may also begin to pause as soon as the coming week, as the virus surge continues and investors worry vaccines are being too slowly deployed,
*****
&gt; “You feel like this recovery rally is going to run out of legs,” Hogan said. He said that with the S&amp;P 500 up about 16% since Nov. 4, investors may begin to think it is getting ahead of itself.
*****
&gt; “That could be next week’s business to contemplate. You’re likely to take some sort of breather,” Hogan said.
*****
&gt; Tom Lee, founder of Fundstrat, said there’s a level on the S&amp;P 500 that could be a turning point for the market. The S&amp;P 500 closed at 3,824 Friday, up 18% for the week.
*****
&gt; “I think there’s a chance we could be hitting 3,900 and that’s a key level for markets,” said Lee. “That’s the level where people are looking for a local top. That’s a level where we could be repelled. It’s a number where if we blast through it, it would be good but if we don’t break through it, it could start the correction. It’s a binary risk.”
*****
&gt; But even if there is a pullback, Lee expects the S&amp;P 500 to reach 4,300 by year end. “I think what the stock market is saying is we’re going to get a really good economy this year,” he said.
*****
&gt; Earnings season should be a positive for stocks.
*****
&gt; “Uncertainty has plagued everyone, so the certainty that comes with earnings is good for stocks,” said Lee.

&gt; # Cyclicals Climb, Defensives Decline

&gt; As we noted in yesterday's Sector Snapshot, cyclical sectors are leading the way higher in 2021 as Energy, Materials, and Financials are all up around 5% or more compared to the S&amp;P 500's gain of a more modest 1.65% YTD. That outperformance has led to some sharp moves in the relative strength lines of several sectors. As shown below, the Materials sector and Financials have both seen sharp moves higher in their relative strength lines versus the S&amp;P 500. For Materials, this has been part of a broader trend of outperformance (upward trending line) that has been in place over the past year. For Financials, prior to this most recent upswing, the line first began to trend higher in the late Fall but then took some pause in December. Meanwhile, Consumer Discretionary, Energy, Health Care, and Industrials have also made moves higher, albeit more modest than those of Materials and Financials.

&gt; As for the other sectors' relative strength lines, there have been some sharp moves in the opposite direction. Starting with what had been market leaders at various points of the past year, Communication Services and Technology are perhaps some of the most notable negative reversals. For the former, the relative strength line has generally moved sideways over the past year, but since mid-December, the line has been on the decline with one of the most dramatic legs lower taking place in the past week. Tech was a consistent outperformer in the first half of 2020, but since the summer that outperformance has faltered. The sector's relative strength line peaked and has been trending sideways since the start of September and the move so far in 2021 has brought the line down towards the low end of the past few months' range. As for other sectors, Real Estate, Utilities, and Consumer Staples have been trending lower for the better portion of the past year, but with cyclical sectors flying, the relative strength lines of these more defensive sectors have made new lows this week in dramatic fashion.

&gt; # Sector Breadth Strong

&gt; Several measures of market breadth have been showing strength recently as we noted in yesterday's Sector Snapshot. Over 80% of S&amp;P 500 stocks trade above their 50-DMAs, more than half are overbought (at least two standard deviations above its 50-DMA), and over 20% of S&amp;P 500 stocks reached new 52-week highs yesterday. Additionally, shorter-term breadth as measured by the 10-day advance-decline line has also been strong. Pretty much across the board, every sector's 10-day A/D line has tipped into overbought levels. That doesn't apply to only Consumer Staples and Real Estate which have more modest readings, though breadth for these sectors has still been positive recently. At the moment, Materials, Health Care, and Financials are the most overbought sectors by this measure. Overall, the sharp moves higher in the 10-day A/D lines does flash a warning sign for the very near term that things are running a bit hot.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/010821-10-day-AD.png))**

&gt; As previously mentioned, several sectors are reaching new 52-week highs, and given breadth has been strong to match, cumulative advance-decline lines are confirming the moves higher. As shown in the charts below, Consumer Discretionary, Health Care, Industrials, Materials, as well as the broader S&amp;P 500 all closed at 52-week highs last week and so too did those sectors’ cumulative A/D lines. While price did not close at new highs, Tech, Financials, and Communication Services also all saw new highs in their cumulative AD lines.

&gt; # Stocks Off to Strong Start to 2021

&gt; The average stock in the Russell 3,000 is already up 5.24% year-to-date after just four trading days. And to think, major indices were down ~1% on the first trading day of the year this past Monday. Below we highlight the average YTD performance of stocks by sector in the Russell 3,000. Remember, the Russell 3,000 contains large-caps, mid-caps, and small-caps, and it covers roughly 98.5% of all US-traded market cap. As shown, Energy stocks have jumped out to the strongest start to the year with an average gain of 13.26%. Materials rank second with a gain of 9.1%, and then Industrials, Financials, Health Care, and Consumer Discretionary are all bunched together with gains between 5% and 6%. Technology stocks -- last year's big leaders -- are 'only' up 4.34% on average so far in 2021, while the Real Estate sector is the only one that has averaged declines.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/sectorsavg.png))**

&gt; Looking at Industry Groups, while Technology as a whole is underperforming a bit, the Semiconductor group (which are part of the Tech sector) is up big with average YTD gains of 9.4%. Autos are also performing very well with a gain of 9.2%. Thank you Tesla (TSLA).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/r3kgroups.png))**

&gt; There are already more than 600 stocks in the Russell 3,000 that are up more than 10% year-to-date. That represents 20% of the index.

&gt; Below is a look at the top-performing stocks so far in 2021. Usually, it takes weeks or months to see YTD gains like these, but we've gotten here in just four trading days. 3D Systems (DDD) ranks first with a gain of 119%, followed by Atomera (ATOM) at 70%, ViewRay (VRAY) at 59.5%, Arcturus (ARCT) at 54%, and Akerna (KERN) at 52%. We don't fault you if you have never heard of these names!

&gt; # Equity Winners and Losers in 2020

&gt; 2020 was a good year for stock investors despite unprecedented challenges.

&gt; After being down more than 30% at the March 2020 lows, the S&amp;P 500 Index ended the year with a solid 18.4% total return. Last year marked the first time the index ended a year positive after being down at least 30% during that year. Gains were driven primarily by the emerging economic recovery taking hold, bolstered by massive stimulus, and the remarkably fast COVID-19 vaccine development that encouraged market participants to begin to price in the end of the pandemic.

&gt; We take a look at some of the asset class and sector winners and losers in 2020.

&gt; Massive growth outperformance. The growth style of investing had one of its biggest runs ever relative to the value style in 2020, benefiting from better positioning for the pandemic, superior earnings growth, and balance sheet strength. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the major growth indexes returned over 30% while the value indexes produced mid-single-digit gains. The technology sector was the biggest driver of growth outperformance (about 60% of it), but the consumer discretionary sector—led by Amazon, one of the biggest stay-at-home stocks—also outperformed the broad markets and value indexes by a wide margin last year.

&gt; # Typical January Trading: Mixed Results since 2000

&gt; Today’s mixed market performance with mega-cap tech shares declining while other major indexes moving higher is not unusual behavior during January in recent years. The only difference is it has usually been tech moving higher while other areas of the market retreated. Since 2000, the S&amp;P 500 has declined eleven times in twenty-one years in January. This recent weakness can be seen in the above January seasonal pattern chart.

&gt; Over the last 21 years, Only NASDAQ has posted a full-month average gain. DJIA, S&amp;P 500, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 have all started January positive, only to surrender early-month gains by the end of the month. Weakness has historically accelerated just after mid-month, around the eleventh trading day.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 11th, 2021.

# **Markets face a big week of news, with stimulus at the top of the list  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/08/markets-face-a-big-week-of-news-with-stimulus-at-the-top-of-the-list.html)**
*****
&gt; Markets will stay laser-focused on the prospect for more fiscal stimulus in the busy week ahead.
*****
&gt; Politics and politicians are likely to continue dominating the headlines, as Democrats seek President Donald Trump’s removal after a mob of his followers took over the Capitol Building on Wednesday.
*****
&gt; But it is stimulus that should get the most attention from investors, who are betting the new Democratic majority in Congress will move quickly and that it could consider a package of $1 trillion or more.
*****
&gt; Stocks rose to record highs in the past week, boosted in large part by the idea of a bigger stimulus package.
*****
&gt; With Democrats now in control of the Senate and House, the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden is expected to deliver an even bigger stimulus package than had been expected with a divided Congress. Biden said Friday the total will be in “the trillions of dollars.” The election Tuesday of two Georgia Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, shifted control of the Senate to Democrats.
*****
&gt; While disturbing, the temporary assault on the Capitol Building did not ruffle markets, and the removal of Trump is not expected to receive enough Republican support to succeed with just days remaining in his term. Biden is scheduled to be sworn in on Jan. 20.
*****
&gt; “The market is willing to look through that chaos, but not through this anticipation of faster and bigger stimulus,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities.
*****
&gt; # Earnings, data ahead
In the normal business of markets, fourth-quarter earnings season begins with the rollout of big banks’ reports Friday, when JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo on tap. There is also a long list of Fed speakers including Chairman Jerome Powell, who is scheduled for a webcast from Princeton University Thursday.
*****
&gt; On the data front, CPI inflation data is released Wednesday and December’s retail sales are reported Friday.
*****
&gt; The consumer price index will be important, and although it is expected to show muted inflation, markets have begun to price in rising expectations in the bond market. One bond market inflation measure, the 10-year breakeven, went as high as 2.1% Thursday, meaning investors expect that to be the average level of inflation over the next 10 years.
*****
&gt; But strategists said little will matter but stimulus, which economists expect will ease the impact of the surging virus on the economy. The U.S. reported more than 4,000 deaths from Covid in one day for the first time Friday.
*****
&gt; The stock market may also begin to pause as soon as the coming week, as the virus surge continues and investors worry vaccines are being too slowly deployed,
*****
&gt; “You feel like this recovery rally is going to run out of legs,” Hogan said. He said that with the S&amp;P 500 up about 16% since Nov. 4, investors may begin to think it is getting ahead of itself.
*****
&gt; “That could be next week’s business to contemplate. You’re likely to take some sort of breather,” Hogan said.
*****
&gt; Tom Lee, founder of Fundstrat, said there’s a level on the S&amp;P 500 that could be a turning point for the market. The S&amp;P 500 closed at 3,824 Friday, up 18% for the week.
*****
&gt; “I think there’s a chance we could be hitting 3,900 and that’s a key level for markets,” said Lee. “That’s the level where people are looking for a local top. That’s a level where we could be repelled. It’s a number where if we blast through it, it would be good but if we don’t break through it, it could start the correction. It’s a binary risk.”
*****
&gt; But even if there is a pullback, Lee expects the S&amp;P 500 to reach 4,300 by year end. “I think what the stock market is saying is we’re going to get a really good economy this year,” he said.
*****
&gt; Earnings season should be a positive for stocks.
*****
&gt; “Uncertainty has plagued everyone, so the certainty that comes with earnings is good for stocks,” said Lee.

&gt; # Cyclicals Climb, Defensives Decline

&gt; As we noted in yesterday's Sector Snapshot, cyclical sectors are leading the way higher in 2021 as Energy, Materials, and Financials are all up around 5% or more compared to the S&amp;P 500's gain of a more modest 1.65% YTD. That outperformance has led to some sharp moves in the relative strength lines of several sectors. As shown below, the Materials sector and Financials have both seen sharp moves higher in their relative strength lines versus the S&amp;P 500. For Materials, this has been part of a broader trend of outperformance (upward trending line) that has been in place over the past year. For Financials, prior to this most recent upswing, the line first began to trend higher in the late Fall but then took some pause in December. Meanwhile, Consumer Discretionary, Energy, Health Care, and Industrials have also made moves higher, albeit more modest than those of Materials and Financials.

&gt; As for the other sectors' relative strength lines, there have been some sharp moves in the opposite direction. Starting with what had been market leaders at various points of the past year, Communication Services and Technology are perhaps some of the most notable negative reversals. For the former, the relative strength line has generally moved sideways over the past year, but since mid-December, the line has been on the decline with one of the most dramatic legs lower taking place in the past week. Tech was a consistent outperformer in the first half of 2020, but since the summer that outperformance has faltered. The sector's relative strength line peaked and has been trending sideways since the start of September and the move so far in 2021 has brought the line down towards the low end of the past few months' range. As for other sectors, Real Estate, Utilities, and Consumer Staples have been trending lower for the better portion of the past year, but with cyclical sectors flying, the relative strength lines of these more defensive sectors have made new lows this week in dramatic fashion.

&gt; # Sector Breadth Strong

&gt; Several measures of market breadth have been showing strength recently as we noted in yesterday's Sector Snapshot. Over 80% of S&amp;P 500 stocks trade above their 50-DMAs, more than half are overbought (at least two standard deviations above its 50-DMA), and over 20% of S&amp;P 500 stocks reached new 52-week highs yesterday. Additionally, shorter-term breadth as measured by the 10-day advance-decline line has also been strong. Pretty much across the board, every sector's 10-day A/D line has tipped into overbought levels. That doesn't apply to only Consumer Staples and Real Estate which have more modest readings, though breadth for these sectors has still been positive recently. At the moment, Materials, Health Care, and Financials are the most overbought sectors by this measure. Overall, the sharp moves higher in the 10-day A/D lines does flash a warning sign for the very near term that things are running a bit hot.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/010821-10-day-AD.png))**

&gt; As previously mentioned, several sectors are reaching new 52-week highs, and given breadth has been strong to match, cumulative advance-decline lines are confirming the moves higher. As shown in the charts below, Consumer Discretionary, Health Care, Industrials, Materials, as well as the broader S&amp;P 500 all closed at 52-week highs last week and so too did those sectors’ cumulative A/D lines. While price did not close at new highs, Tech, Financials, and Communication Services also all saw new highs in their cumulative AD lines.

&gt; # Stocks Off to Strong Start to 2021

&gt; The average stock in the Russell 3,000 is already up 5.24% year-to-date after just four trading days. And to think, major indices were down ~1% on the first trading day of the year this past Monday. Below we highlight the average YTD performance of stocks by sector in the Russell 3,000. Remember, the Russell 3,000 contains large-caps, mid-caps, and small-caps, and it covers roughly 98.5% of all US-traded market cap. As shown, Energy stocks have jumped out to the strongest start to the year with an average gain of 13.26%. Materials rank second with a gain of 9.1%, and then Industrials, Financials, Health Care, and Consumer Discretionary are all bunched together with gains between 5% and 6%. Technology stocks -- last year's big leaders -- are 'only' up 4.34% on average so far in 2021, while the Real Estate sector is the only one that has averaged declines.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/sectorsavg.png))**

&gt; Looking at Industry Groups, while Technology as a whole is underperforming a bit, the Semiconductor group (which are part of the Tech sector) is up big with average YTD gains of 9.4%. Autos are also performing very well with a gain of 9.2%. Thank you Tesla (TSLA).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/r3kgroups.png))**

&gt; There are already more than 600 stocks in the Russell 3,000 that are up more than 10% year-to-date. That represents 20% of the index.

&gt; Below is a look at the top-performing stocks so far in 2021. Usually, it takes weeks or months to see YTD gains like these, but we've gotten here in just four trading days. 3D Systems (DDD) ranks first with a gain of 119%, followed by Atomera (ATOM) at 70%, ViewRay (VRAY) at 59.5%, Arcturus (ARCT) at 54%, and Akerna (KERN) at 52%. We don't fault you if you have never heard of these names!

&gt; # Equity Winners and Losers in 2020

&gt; 2020 was a good year for stock investors despite unprecedented challenges.

&gt; After being down more than 30% at the March 2020 lows, the S&amp;P 500 Index ended the year with a solid 18.4% total return. Last year marked the first time the index ended a year positive after being down at least 30% during that year. Gains were driven primarily by the emerging economic recovery taking hold, bolstered by massive stimulus, and the remarkably fast COVID-19 vaccine development that encouraged market participants to begin to price in the end of the pandemic.

&gt; We take a look at some of the asset class and sector winners and losers in 2020.

&gt; Massive growth outperformance. The growth style of investing had one of its biggest runs ever relative to the value style in 2020, benefiting from better positioning for the pandemic, superior earnings growth, and balance sheet strength. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the major growth indexes returned over 30% while the value indexes produced mid-single-digit gains. The technology sector was the biggest driver of growth outperformance (about 60% of it), but the consumer discretionary sector—led by Amazon, one of the biggest stay-at-home stocks—also outperformed the broad markets and value indexes by a wide margin last year.

&gt; # Typical January Trading: Mixed Results since 2000

&gt; Today’s mixed market performance with mega-cap tech shares declining while other major indexes moving higher is not unusual behavior during January in recent years. The only difference is it has usually been tech moving higher while other areas of the market retreated. Since 2000, the S&amp;P 500 has declined eleven times in twenty-one years in January. This recent weakness can be seen in the above January seasonal pattern chart.

&gt; Over the last 21 years, Only NASDAQ has posted a full-month average gain. DJIA, S&amp;P 500, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 have all started January positive, only to surrender early-month gains by the end of the month. Weakness has historically accelerated just after mid-month, around the eleventh trading day.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great week ahead r/StockMarket.",65,29,1610153463.0,2021-01-09T00:51:03+00:00,t3_ktg7bj,StockMarket
99,TSM,Temptation to sell stocks that are doing very well because I'm interested in other ones,"My title might sound terrible, bear with me:

&amp;#x200B;

My stocks currently are CRSR, DKNGS, LGVW, NNOX, PLTR, TSM, THCB, and I have ICLN, along with SWPPX. I'm up 20% in at least everything except for NNOX since I just got into it, and I am loving my gains.

I believe all of these (except for maybe ICLN and PLTR) are going to continue to rise, but I am interested in other stocks that may become bigger in the future.

Here is my dilemma and my question to you all: how do you determine when you want to leave a profitable venture, and join another? Is it just off of hype from what others discuss? Your own research? Your belief that your current investments have hit their peak(if you can call it that)

I only actually invest new money when my VA disability comes in, so I tend to either) hold investments for longer than I should, or) sell to try my luck in something new.

Things I'm looking into include: switching SWPPX to SCHWG or SWTSX, ICLN into ARKG or LIT (very doubtful because this is my first ETF and I don't want to get too deep into something I don't understand), NET, and EVVTY.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks friends let's lose more money together in 2021.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I am VERY bullish on CRSR, but that could be bias from them making me 88% profit since they went public, until they lulled to 39. Am I a fool for staying in?",15,24,1610078742.0,2021-01-08T04:05:42+00:00,t3_ksupsk,investing

TDOC, TSM, TCEHY and SPLK are all in four of the five ARKs, so obviously they believe in them. TCEHY doesn’t have options available (at least on RH)

I have a few thousand dollars available, what’s everyone’s opinion of buying leaps on the other three stocks?",2,13,1609912681.0,2021-01-06T05:58:01+00:00,t3_krhpsr,options
73,TSM,Major Option Purchases 12/23 - 12-31,"In this post I will be looking at major option purchases from 12/23 - 12/31. The goal of this analysis is to see if the 'smart money' is worth following or if they are just as good or maybe even worse than retail.

The criteria for this analysis is option purchases where the total premium is over $100,000. This helps me filter out the noise created by some of the larger retail traders. Additionally, I removed contracts where the expiration was last week as I think it will be more interesting to follow contracts that have a future expiration. This left me with a total of 735 positions entered between 12/23 - 12/30 where the premium was over $100,000. My data is collected over multiple sources and I do my best to make sure there is no redundant or false information.

# Call Flow

[Call Flow](https://preview.redd.it/o259zdkzmd961.png?width=1678&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d34742e90edbf1deba233ef3e8bd4af5eb972520)

To start I looked at call option flow. To simplify things I looked at the top 25 option call flows based on premium. Its worth noticing how many times TESLA is on the above list (8/25). Beside TSLA none of the call flow is really so reaching and for the most part pretty safe. The tickers in the above list are 'XPEV', 'CRM', 'TSLA', 'NKE', 'BABA', 'GM', 'PINS', 'BIDU', 'ZM', 'EEM', 'PLNT', 'MSFT', 'EBAY', 'SPX', 'MA', and 'DIS'.

# Put Flow

Some worth paying attention to on the above list are the SPY 2/19/21 354 Puts, QS 2/19/2021 80 Puts, CDLX 4/16/2021 PUTS as these expire relatively soon and would require a decent pull back to end In The Money. The tickers in the above list are 'PLUG', 'AAPL', 'SPY', 'ARKK', 'IWM', 'UAL', 'QS', 'SKT', 'LMND', 'CDLX', 'OLLI', 'GLD', 'GME', 'TSLA', 'QQQ', 'TAN'.

# Target Flow

The targeted option flow is calculated based on specific criteria I have used to trade over the last year. I call it Targeted Flow because this is typically where I find the best results. Essentially it is a mixture of volume, open interest, premium, expiration date and % move required. Interestingly out of all the options flow my algorithm picked up between 12/23 and 12/31 all of the ""Targeted Flow"" was Calls. As you can see all of the EXP below are for 1/15/2021 meaning the option flow buyers expect a big upwards move quickly.

&amp;#x200B;

Once again 8/25 Targeted Flows are TSLA. This really shouldn't be surprising, but I am amazed at how truly bullish TSLA is. Contracts on this list that I think are worth investigating are CSIQ, GSX, IQ, TSM and FDX, but do what you wish with this information. One thing that stands out to me in this Target Flow is that 69/69 of the option flow my algo picked up were all calls (as I said above). Typically when the market is leaning so far in one direction the opposite happens so it will be real interesting to see how the next two weeks play out. Based on how today is going I think we see lower over the next two weeks into the 1/15/21 exp.

Just for fun here is the TSLA call flow with over $100,000,000 in premium.... CRAZY

5,TSM,Weekend IV Report - Tickers with low IV and cheap premiums,"What's up fellas at Options. I made a tool called [FD Ranker](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/fd-ranker) that logs the average IV of popular tickers. The tool is inclusive of almost 1,000 tickers now.

**What is this tool good for**

I posted in ThetaGang the list with HIGH IV options which is great for running the wheel or selling options. This list is an inverse of that list and displays tickers where IV is pretty low, thus, purchasing calls will likely be cheaper. For example, AAPL implied volatility right now is almost back to the pre-March lows. Remember a low IV can go lower and a high IV can go higher. Do your DD before entering any positions!

100,TSM,Let's reflect on our performance in 2020,"*Happy New Year, folks! It's certainly been an interesting one.*

*I thought it would be interesting to look back on how we did for the year and reflect on what went right and what didn't.*

I'll go first. This year, my CAGR ended up around a tidy 30% (Personal RoR, although my TWRoR is similar). 

I'm quite happy with my performance, given my relative inexperience (I've only been in this game for ~4 years, and this was my first year trading options). We'll see how much of it I'll have to give back in the next correction.

**What did I do right?**

Well, my core positions have been pretty consistent. ~15% of my portfolio is in semiconductors, mainly TSM, and the structural advantages, increasing applications, and large moat that this industry has continues to pay off. 

My next largest sector is consumer discretional retail (AMZN, BABA, MELI, RTH, WMT), which saw a huge boost because of the lockdown. I am worried about seeing some pullback next year and shoppers return to their previous habits, but we'll handle that if/when it occurs.

My biggest gains have been from well-timed purchases of smaller cap companies: BJRI, BLMN, M, JWN, DLTR, and AAL were all very kind to me.

ARKK, ICLN, and QCLN have been good ways of getting exposure to areas where I don't have a strong point of view, but see potential for continued gains.

I got into SPACs the last few months of the year. It's a relatively low-information market, and seems somewhat luck-based, but I have made some successful plays there as well.

My decision in August to keep any funds not allocated to an active strategy or thesis in VTI and VTWO instead of in BND or as cash has paid off, due to low interest rates and asset inflation.

**What was just OK?**

My third largest sector is healthcare, which underperformed relative to the eyepopping gains in tech and retail. I'm alright with the opportunity cost there.

I made a small investment into Bitcoin, which I sold at $19k after a 16% gain. I should have held (hedled?) - but I have trouble remaining confident in investments without a strong underlying value investing thesis.

My luck with short-selling has been poor this year. My short positions in GSX and NKLA were pretty successful, but I lost a lot of money shorting FCPT, ACC, BLMN, and BJRI earlier in the year. On the other hand, the excellent performance of BJRI and BLMN meant I later turned them into (ultimately very profitable) long positions, which I likely wouldn't have discovered without the initial short thesis.

There are so many astounding run-ups I knew about rather early on and missed out on: TSLA, MRNA, NIO, PLTR, QS. The hype around these tickers and the sky-high PE ratios scared me off, which might not be a good response in the current market regime. That said, my investing style has to fit my philosophy and psychology to work, so I'll remain disciplined in trying to find opportunities that match my approach.


**What choices were mistakes?**

I tried options this year. I began by paper trading options and lost a lot of (fake money). I then moved on the real-life option plays, and basically broke even. Even so, the stress is *unreal*. I understand how the option greeks and Black-Scholes works, but it still catches me by surprise when the price moves in my favor and my positions lose money anyway. The wide bid/ask spreads and crazy volatility is really hard to deal with, and a single options play starts to take up more space in my head than the rest of my portfolio. As a result, I often end up selling too soon. I don't think directional options plays are for me. I may try selling covered calls in the future.

About 60% of the time I've tried to catch a falling knife this year, I've failed. OTGLY and SWI are two good examples. I'm still not sure how to deal with this.

I suck at scalping - My attempts at day-trading SPXL and SPXS during March and April's high-volatility periods destroyed the subsequent 3 months of returns.

**What did I learn?**

Value investing is still alive and well in 2020 - you just need to understand how to look for opportunities and value growing companies.

I need to respect the tax man: I didn't max out my 401k contribution this year because I wanted to amass some cash in order to eventually put a down payment on a property - I'm going to pay for that in April.

I still don't know where the sweet spot is for leverage. I know options aren't it for me, but I can't help but feel that I could improve my returns by levering up on my high-conviction, low-volatility plays. I'll continue to explore this in 2021.

Excited to see how you all did this year!",0,3,1609471243.0,2021-01-01T03:20:43+00:00,t3_ko4235,investing

6,TSM,Weekend IV Report - Tickers with low IV and cheap premiums,"What's up fellas at Options. I made a tool called [FD Ranker](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/fd-ranker) that logs the average IV of popular tickers. The tool is inclusive of almost 1,000 tickers now.

**What is this tool good for**

I posted in ThetaGang the list with HIGH IV options which is great for running the wheel or selling options. This list is an inverse of that list and displays tickers where IV is pretty low, thus, purchasing calls will likely be cheaper. For example, AAPL implied volatility right now is almost back to the pre-March lows. Remember a low IV can go lower and a high IV can go higher. Do your DD before entering any positions!

# Low IV Tickers List

\*Some of the market cap data is off, so always double check before entering any plays!

Please note this list is only inclusive of the more popular tickers mentioned around Reddit. If you want to see the full list and filter by ticker, check out the tool in the link at the top.

8,TSM,Weekend IV Report - Tickers with LOW Implied Volatility and lower premiums,"What's up fellas at Options. I made a tool called [FD Ranker](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/fd-ranker) that logs the average IV of popular tickers. The tool is inclusive of almost 1,000 tickers now.

**What is this tool good for**

I posted in ThetaGang the list with HIGH IV options which is great for running the wheel or selling options. This list is an inverse of that list and displays tickers where IV is pretty low, thus, purchasing calls will likely be cheaper. For example, AAPL implied volatility right now is near the lows and almost back to the pre-March lows. Remember a low IV can go lower and a high IV can go higher. Do your DD before entering any positions!

If you guys find this list useful (it's my first time posting this here), I can make this a weekly/weekend thing. I like doing it on Sundays so I can prepare for the trading week ahead.

# Low IV Tickers List

\*Some of the market cap data is off, so always double check before entering any plays! Also, the ""next earnings date"" data will resume starting in January, 2021 (very soon).

Please note this list is only inclusive of the more popular tickers mentioned around Reddit. If you want to see the full list and filter by ticker, check out the tool in the link at the top.

83,TSM,IV Report - Popular tickers with the lowest IV,"Hello everyone,

I saw someone post here a few days ago asking for a list of tickers with the *lowest* IV to purchase calls on. Here’s the list, it displays “popular” tickers under 50% IV. I post a weekly report with tickers with highest IV over in ThetaGang every Sunday. 

If you find it useful I can post an updated list every Sunday while you guys prepare your plays for the week.

96,TSM,Is it more advantageous to buy deep ITM LEAPS or OTM LEAPS?,Right now I'm interested in buying LEAPS for TSM and I'm very bullish on it over the next few year. My understanding is that buying deep ITM will allow one to treat it as a synthetic stock and will be a safer approach than OTM. In what circumstances will buying OTM LEAPS be more advantageous?,162,121,1606927114.0,2020-12-02T16:38:34+00:00,t3_k5cp9p,options

97,TSM,Premium prices,"I'm a newer options trader. Past year or so. I notice sometimes when a lot of flow is coming in on a particular option that the premium will be increasing but none of the Greeks are changing.. I've seen this on a few recently. One was PDD yesterday. I bought in right before the breakout of 150 and the Dec 4 170 strike was 3.60. PDD hit a high of 155 and the option was worth at the peak 7.40. when the price came back down to 150 again the option was worth 5.40. the IV had changed a few percentage points but nothing that warrants this. Just curious if this is a bullish sign or mm taking advantage of the higher call volume, supply and demand . Any insite would be helpful. I did see this on TSM last week . 88 strike that expired yesterday
 premiums moved up 40 dollars and the stock price stayed the same.",1,6,1605389038.0,2020-11-14T21:23:58+00:00,t3_ju9miz,options

74,TSM,Question about a put credit spread I messed up,"I opened a TSM put credit weekly spread earlier this week and got tested fairly quickly. I rolled it down and out into a monthly, where the short put is at $80. 

The credit was $17. I'm looking at it and the spread is worth almost $200.... but not because the long put became $1 like I thought. The short put is a dollar.

Assuming this lasts in any amount, which I'm sure it won't, how would I close this? I can't buy to close it because the $80 short put is $1 (as in, $.01) and the long out is $199 (as in $1.99). I didn't even realize this was happening.",1,5,1602886005.0,2020-10-16T22:06:45+00:00,t3_jcjaqg,thetagang

For Trading October 15th
   
BANKS BEAT BUT FALTER
 

 Added some QQQ putskis today.

 
Today’s market was interesting…not good or bad, just interesting.  It always concerns me when the earnings news is good and the market falls.  UNH, BAC, and GS all reported, and the numbers were good, and all fell well off the highs, with UNH the only one to close up, and only pennies at that.  After the hotter than expected PPI numbers came out, the open was slightly higher, but it didn’t last long.  After the DJIA hit the high for the day +120, it turned down and by 11:00 it was down for the day.  The DJIA finished -165.81 (.58%), NASDAQ -95.17 (.80%), S&amp;P 500 -23.26 (.66%), the Russell -15.20 (.93%) and the DJ Transports the big winner at +105.67 (.90%).  Internals were soft at 1.5:1 on NYSE and 1.9:1 on the NAZ.  The DJIA was 10 up, 20 down, with UNH the biggest decliner paring 64 DP’s off the average.  Tomorrow we have UAL, WBA, MS, and TSM reporting as well as the continuing and initial claims, Phili Fed, Empire State and Export / Import numbers for Sept.  Lots of stuff to digest.


Tonight’s closing comment video: https://youtu.be/Z-R_NRe9TLM
 
See our Honest  Abe trade records for the year in our video/ discord etc...

SECTORS:  There was good news for the banks, again, but by midday it just didn’t matter.  Today’s losers were BAC, GS, and the biggest loser, UNH which was trading +2.50 premarket and never even made it to unchanged, finishing -9.57, which cost the DJIA 64DP’s.  There was some good news for holders of Concho Resources.  The talk is that they are a takeover candidate and after hitting $51.00 it closed on the lows, but still +4.79 (10.8%) on the day.  FSLY holders weren’t quite so lucky.  The stock which traded $10.63 in March has been a juggernaut, hitting $136.50 yesterday, reported after the close that their prior expectations of revenue “should not be relied upon.”  It seems that geopolitical concerns had hampered their operation.  The customer is the parent company of TIK TOK!  While the numbers given (they report on 10/28) aren’t terrible, when your stock has risen the way this one has, it’s a problem. The last on it in late trading was $91.28 -37.55 (30%) after a low of $86.40.   Even at this lower price, the stock is still up from the start of the year by 400%.
Another favorite, DraftKings (DKNG) has not acted well since doing their offering last week priced about $4.00 under the market @ $52.00 and has not been able to climb back over that level.  The stock closed $48.04 -3.14 today (6.14%).  The continuing Covid-19 issues for major sports teams and cancelled and postponed may be weighing on the stock in the short term.  
After the close VRTX reported the end of their trial on a protein-deficiency treatment.  The stock fell from its close of $371.46 -4.63 to trade $235.01 and closed $239 -37.09 (13.43%).

 Tomorrow is another day.

99,TSM,This week's earnings and expected moves comparison,"The stubborn elevated implied volatility across the major indices finally fell a bit at the end of last week with the VIX dropping from 29  to 25. That means slightly narrower expected moves into earnings  season. Earnings kicks off tomorrow morning with Citi, JP Morgan and  Johnson &amp; Johnson. Most stocks will enter their announcements not only pricing their own news but also broader market uncertainty, but some of that uncertainty got re-priced last week as the election results and stimulus negotiations became somewhat clearer. VIX futures still show election week as the highest demand for options premium. 

Here's how this week looks through the lens of the options market.

### Expected Moves via Options AI

* Last week's expected move in SPY: 2.2%
* Last week’s actual move SPY: +3.8%
* This week's expected move in SPY: 1.6%:

100,TSM,Good time to buy LEAPS?,"Got $15k cash that I want to buy LEAPS with. Should I wait till after the election or just buy a bunch now? Thinking AMD, TSM, RDS.B, and BABA. Thanks",0,6,1601593021.0,2020-10-01T22:57:01+00:00,t3_j3j9ot,options
21,TSM,Torn between ETFS. XLE and ICLN,"I'm torn between two ETFS.  Banking on a return to work scenario, XLE is historically cheap.  Not being this cheap since 2004.  However it has dropped about 46-50% recently due to the Coronavirus.

ICLN is recently at an all time high for clean energy on the opposite end of things.  It has gone up 46-50% I believe YTD and is doing the opposite of XLE.  However if Trump wins, he historically favors oil and gas producers.  Nevertheless, ICLN has managed to stagnant most of the time until just this year.  I'm afraid if I buy, it may never reach this high for a very long time.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I just sit out both of these funds?  I have most of my portfolio in Dollar Tree, Nvidia, Taiwan semiconductor manufacturing.  Digital payments, a few banks, defense stocks during this dip, and technology.  My portfolio is doing well.  Maybe I don't need to add energy to it.  I tried oil and gas once and got burned out of 200$, which was fine since my Roth has 50k in it.",9,20,1601476162.0,2020-09-30T14:29:22+00:00,t3_j2n649,investing

57,TSM,Sexy TSMC: The best-valued Tendie producing semiconductor company for the future.,"Are you sad about missing out on the NVDA, AMD, and AAPL runups? The good news is that the company that provides essential semiconductor capabilities to these companies is TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.) TSM contractually manufactures chipsets for 499 clients. By focusing solely on contracted production, TSM has the smallest (5nm) chip on the market and a 3nm chip on the horizon, creating an infrastructural economic moat insurmountable even for the aforementioned veteran firms, who struggle to produce 7nm chips by comparison. Recently blowing Intel out of the water, TSMC is years ahead of its competitors.

TSMC is trading at a 26.67 P/E ratio, compared to NVDA's 91 P/E and AMD's 152 P/E ratio. One reason for this cheap valuation is that people think Taiwan may be invaded by mainland China. As a student of international relations specifically studying Cross-Strait relations, I can tell you this is a fallacy. Taiwan-United States relations have never been better, and the United States even has a bill that almost explicitly says The United States will protect Taiwan in the event of an attack. [https://www.voanews.com/east-asia-pacific/why-us-lawmakers-introduce-bill-after-bill-help-taiwan](https://www.voanews.com/east-asia-pacific/why-us-lawmakers-introduce-bill-after-bill-help-taiwan)

Another reason why people may be scared of TSMC's future is because of mainland China's desire to get into the semiconductor industry. Recently, however, rumors that TSMC employees have been poached to mainland China's were proven false. The company is dead in the water, leaving TSMC as the sole fab. [https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4004304](https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4004304) TMSC is also expanding production capacity by planning a massive $12bn manufacturing facility in Arizona, showing clear growth potential. 

After great news in late July, the stock has shot up about 20%. Since then, it has successfully tested a base of $77 time and time again. The 10-week line (in red) is rapidly approaching this base, and the company is ready to shoot off.

Think about it: with Neuralink, self-driving cars, faster cell phones, drones, electronic body implants and accessories, and more automation, what product will be in the highest demand? The minuscule yet powerful semiconductors that drive these products.

85,TSM,NVDA to 1000,"Ok, so you know how Apple has been mooning on news of the iPhone 12, and ARM MacBooks, which has totally screwed over INTC and made TSM and other suppliers to AAPL moon?

(Here's the background info in case you missed the news [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS52JigV1CY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS52JigV1CY))

Apple was actually approached by Softbank to buy ARM but they couldn't due to ARM licensing stuff out to competitors as well, and Apple obviously has a very private philosophy too so that wouldn't work. But, they will continue to use chipsets based on ARM's architecture for the future macbooks/iphones as well ([https://wccftech.com/apple-shows-disinterest-in-buying-arm-from-softbank/](https://wccftech.com/apple-shows-disinterest-in-buying-arm-from-softbank/)). But if you just follow the money, and try to find out who actually will OWN ARM, the offer has come from none other than Nvidia, and the deal to buy ARM is all but confirmed. (seeck ingalpha.com/article/4370499-chippening-part-2-nvidia-reaches-for-outstretched-arm). And I'm sure that most of you are aware of how AAPL is trying to expand its reach into countries like India for the first time offering first-party stores and an online store, etc. This will only increase their sales numbers, and Apple will only get more bullet proof from hereon. The real story here, is in NVDA.

When they do end up buying ARM, the merger will either be seen as A.) a value destroying buy that wasn't worth it or B.) A merger of epic proportions that inserts Nvidia into the mobile and CPU market ""Apple recently indicated it would change their use of Intel chips in Mac computers to custom made ARM-based chips. This is likely due to the desire to include a touch screen and also due to the general efficiency of the design as well as ARM's licensing of its IP to Apple. This could be the start of a major transition for chip usage among desktop computers. Moreover, this technology appears to be competitive for use in data-centers markets.

NVIDIA is not currently a major competitor in the smartphone and tablet business, so acquiring ARM would expand it into new realms where ARM happens to dominate. NVIDIA did previously attempt to compete in this business, but its Tegra chips never got much market share.""

Most of you already know how durable Nvidia is, but for those of you that don't I'll leave you with these too: Nvidia's R&amp;D expense/gross profit is surprisingly low due to multiple income streams, and although it is increasing (as expected) we can expect gross profits to massively increase too with the world's largest company as its customer. Their Cash per share has grown insanely :

And they have low long term debt that has barely increased, but their assets have remarkably increased, which means a low lt debt/asset ratio, just showing you how much of a powerhouse NVDA is.

Not only that, but along with decreasing/flatlining long term debt, they have a negative cash conversion cycle, which greatly reduces opex. Financially, this is only the beginning of their buildup. Aside from just solid financials for such a revolutionary company, they have revolutionary products. Their cloud services and acquisition of Mellanox will only expand their bases. Nvidia has a vision, and it may be very far-out and hard to accomplish or it may be the most genius thing I've ever seen. I'm not sure how long this'll take to work itself out, but I wouldn't fear buying March 2021 740 calls.

I'm currently looking at stocks like AMD, NVDA, TSM, ASML. Now, since TSM and ASML are the backbones of AMD and NVDA, these stocks are clearly highly correlated; AMD's success is TSM's success, though TSM could fallback on AAPL or NVDA if AMD were to fail. So my question is, would it be a bad idea to combine them all in my portfolio? Assuming my objective is to bet on AMD's growth, is there any benefit to also adding TSM to the mix?",9,23,1597101863.0,2020-08-10T23:24:23+00:00,t3_i7g97n,investing
105,TSM,The underrated stock survey! Submit your picks for the community to track,"Following on the previous tracking post ([http://redd.it/i2mmzg](http://redd.it/i2mmzg))  and the highly upvoted request from /u/DJ-Ascii , I've set up this post for another round of underrated or undervalued stock picks.

As before, let us know what stock you believe is underrated and a consistent winner that has done well for you, or you believe will do well going forward.

“NEW ALL-TIME HIGH FOR GOLD”
 
BITCOIN RALLIES
 
 Our NEM spread is still cruising
 
Today’s market got off to a mixed start NASDAQ higher and a somewhat subdued start for the DJIA and S&amp;P-500, but the others caught up quickly and all rallied into the close with the DJIA +114.88 (.43%), NASDAQ +173.09 (1.67%), S&amp;P 500 +23.78 (.74%), the Russell +17.10 (1.17%) and the DJ Transports +87.30 (.90%).  Market internals continued positive with both NYSE and NASDAQ 1.5:1 higher although volume was down.  DJIA was 17 up and 13 down with no major movers but AAPL adding 60 DP’s and BA losing 25.  Durable goods gained 7.3% vs. 6.4 expected and that gave the market some solid underpinnings.  Commodities were all higher as the U.S. Dollar continues to fall.  While I think that we may get a reflex rally shortly, commodities are still cheaper than stocks.

SECTORS: DraftKings (DKNG) really took it on the chin today as several baseball teams had players that tested positive for COVID-19.  This had a snowball effect and caused a total of 5 teams cancelling games and putting into question the viability of continuing sports available for betting.  The NFL is also at odds with the NFL Players association over several issues and that would clearly put into question of whether there will be a season for them also.  After the deal with the SPAC to bring the company public the stock had a steady rise from the $12.00 level to a high of $44.79, a decline and a pullback and an attempt to move higher that resulted in a lower high (43.75 in June), and another decline back to 27.54 in July and another lower high of 38.84 last week and the possible start of a new decline.  While the stock is a favorite of bettors without sports to bet on and the legions of new RobinHood investors, it is still an “unseasoned security” and is subject to erratic swings.  It would not surprise me if baseball ends in the short term to see this one back at $24- $25.
On the rise today, TSM up 12.7% on speculation that the INTC news of problems with their new chips would cause them to purchase chips from TSM.  After close of $67.37 on Thursday, TSM closed up at 73.90 Friday and gapped up today to finish $83.25 +9.35 (12.7%) and is now $84.88 in after hours.

267,TSM,Intel stock savaged as next-gen chip delay expected to be ‘increasingly painful’ to chip maker,"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/intel-stock-savaged-as-next-gen-chip-delay-prompts-loss-of-confidence-from-wall-street-2020-07-24


Intel Corp.’s stock logged one of its worst days in 20 years Friday after the chip giant divulged that its next generation of chips would be delayed and that it may seek a third-party manufacturer to make them, handing a huge win to smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc.

Intel INTC, -16.24% shares closed down 16.2% at $50.59 Friday, after dropping below $50 for the first time in five months. The one-day drop was the stock’s worst since March, when it finished down 18%, but that was amid a broader market rout when the S&amp;P 500 index SPX, -0.61% tanked 12% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.93% had its worst day ever with a 12.3% dive. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 was only off 0.6% Friday, and the Nasdaq finished down 0.9%.

Other than the March 16 rout, Intel shares have only seen worse days three other times over the past 20 years, two 18% drops in 2002 and a 22% drop in 2000.

Late Thursday, Intel said it was delaying its 7-nanometer line of chips by at least six months because of a “defect mode” and that it may have to resort to a contingency plan of using “somebody else’s foundry” to make them. In chip parlance, nanometers, or nm, refers to the size of the transistors that go on a computer chip, with the general rule being that smaller transistors are faster and more efficient in using power.

As a result, shares of AMD AMD, +16.50%, which already sells 7-nm chips, soared 16.5% to close at a record $69.40, only the second time AMD has ever closed at a higher stock price than Intel. Meanwhile, American depositary receipts of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. TSM, +9.69%, which makes AMD’s chips, rallied 9.7%. to close at $73.90.

Intel, on Friday, shed $41.54 billion in market capitalization, putting it far behind Nvidia Corp. NVDA, +0.63% in the previously close race for most valuable U.S. chip maker. Nvidia shares finished Friday up 0.6% at $407.78 for a market cap of $250.78 billion, versus Intel’s $214.2 billion.",200,65,1595643417.0,2020-07-25T02:16:57+00:00,t3_hxexbs,StockMarket
291,TSM,Intel ($INTC) on track to go back to March lows today (-14% pre-market),"Intel shares slumped after warning about another production delay, sparking concern the world’s largest chipmaker will fall further behind rivals in a crucial area it once dominated.

At issue is a new method for cranking out smaller, more powerful chips, the timing of which “is shifting approximately six months relative to prior expectations”.

Intel’s first 7-nanometer chips will go on sale at the end of 2022 or early 2023, Chief Executive Officer Bob Swan said on a conference call. That’s a year behind schedule. AMD is already selling 7-nanometer-based processors.

Competitive pressure has been building on Intel in recent years. The company designs and manufacturers its own processors, while many rivals focus on design and tap Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to make their chips. That’s helped TSMC improve production faster than Intel, and given companies such as AMD a new chance to compete.

With this mornings’ pre-market currently indicating opening at $52 (-14%), I’m torn on what to do with Intel.  I’ve been invested in $INTC since Feb 2018, and got in around $45.  Is Intel struggling to compete and on the decline, or and therefore a tech behemoth of the past, or is this a great buy-in for the company?",14,50,1595591650.0,2020-07-24T11:54:10+00:00,t3_hx0ezj,stocks

# **Earnings and fiscal debate could be catalysts for stocks in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/17/earnings-and-fiscal-debate-could-be-catalysts-for-stocks-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; Investors are braced for a barrage of earnings news, and the debate in Washington around the next stimulus package may also be an important catalyst for markets since it has implications for the economic recovery.
*****
&gt; Big tech names, including Microsoft, Intel, Twitter and IBM, are among companies reporting in the week ahead, as is high-flying Tesla. Blue chips Coca-Cola, Verizon, American Express and Travelers are also among the dozens of major companies releasing results.
*****
&gt; Congress returns from its break and should pick up the pace of negotiations towards a new fiscal stimulus package, which is expected to address aid for state and local governments and enhanced unemployment benefits. Unemployment benefits, including the $600 additional weekly payment now going to millions, is expected to be a hot topic of discussion, as the benefit ends on July 31.
*****
&gt; There are just a few items of note on the economic calendar, including existing home sales on Wednesday, unemployment claims data on Thursday and new home sales on Friday.
*****
&gt; The spread of the coronavirus will also be closely monitored, as well as any signs of medical progress. The Lancet medical journal is expected to release early stage human trial data Monday on a vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca.
*****
&gt; # ‘Push and pull’ in market
&gt; Investors also will be watching the market’s own dynamics in the week ahead. There is tension within the market between the bubbly run-up of tech and momentum names on the Nasdaq, and the broader market, or S&amp;P 500, which is basically still flat for the year. The Nasdaq is up 17% year to date, but in the past week lagged other indices, turning in a loss, while the Dow and S&amp;P 500 were both higher.
*****
&gt; The Nasdaq’s outperformance came to an abrupt end Monday, and it has lagged since then. In dramatic fashion, the index rose sharply to new highs, with many big tech names and Tesla also hitting highs. Within the same session, there was a massive reversal in the index and in tech and momentum names, and they closed sharply lower.
*****
&gt; Now strategists are watching to see if the froth will be let out slowly or blow off in a big move that takes the rest of the market with it.
*****
&gt; “We expect the push and pull of the Nasdaq to continue and have sustained volatility, in our view, throughout the earnings season,” said Julian Emanuel, head of equity and derivatives strategy at BTIG. “Volatility could be to the upside, as well as the downside, but in our view, in aggregate, the Nasdaq is likely to correct.”
*****
&gt; Emanuel said the volatile reversal in the Nasdaq does not bode well for the Nasdaq, and it could see a 10% correction. There’s been a surge of retail activity in some of the frothiest names, such as Tesla, which surged from about $1,000 at the end of June to a high of $1,795 during Monday’s session. It is since about $300 per share lower.
*****
&gt; “The combination of public participation and just incredible valuations makes the sector very, very vulnerable. ... It’s the sector with the highest earnings expectations,” said Emanuel. “There’s virtually nothing that management can say at these valuations that’s going to create further upside to these names.”
*****
&gt; Tesla and Microsoft report earnings Wednesday, and Twitter reports Thursday.
*****
&gt; # A bump up in stimulus
&gt; As Congress heads back to Washington in the coming week, expectations are rising that the fiscal stimulus package could be slightly more than Republicans were previously expected to approve.
*****
&gt; When Congress broke for the July 4 holiday, there was a big divide on how much stimulus should be added, on top of the $2.4 trillion already adopted. The Democratic proposal was for $3 trillion, while Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said no more than $1 trillion. Now the gulf has narrowed, but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the $1.3 trillion under discussions is not enough.
*****
&gt; Cornerstone Macro’s Andy Laperriere said the package could now be $1.5 trillion or more, more than he expected just several weeks ago. He said more money is now expected for state and local governments, local schools, public health, virus testing and payments to support individuals..
*****
&gt; “Republicans really want to use this bill to encourage and incentivize businesses and schools to open. But I think the big thing is a month ago, the top priority of Republicans was to keep this bill small,” he said.
*****
&gt; One of the most controversial elements of the CARES stimulus package was the $600 weekly payment to people who were already collecting unemployment.
*****
&gt; The payment is likely to be significantly reduced and then ultimately phased out, but that will only come after compromise. “There’s going to be some lines-in-the-sand issues, and this is one of them,” said Laperriere, head of policy at Cornerstone.
*****
&gt; President Donald Trump has said he won’t sign the bill unless there is a payroll tax cut, which was previously rejected by Congress. Payroll taxes are paid by both employers and employees, and they fund government programs, including Medicare and Social Security.
*****
&gt; Strategists said the market could react to the deliberations if they take longer than expected, or the funds are viewed as insufficient.
*****
&gt; Michael Schumacher, Wells Fargo director of rate strategy, said the bond market will focus on how quickly the government plans to payout the stimulus and also the degree to which the Treasury will ultimately have to increase auction sizes to pay for it.
*****
&gt; If Congress keeps to its schedule, it needs to approve the package before the end of the month, when it heads to another recess for the entire month of August.

# The Good and the Bad from Earnings This Week

&gt; Earnings season began at the start of this week with Pepsi (PEP) and the first of the major US banks and brokers reporting Q2 numbers. It was a light week with only 32 companies reporting through Thursday, but in the coming weeks, we'll see 100+ reports on multiple trading days.

&gt; From our Earnings Explorer tool, below is a recap of the results from this week's earnings reports. 78% of companies that reported this week beat consensus analyst EPS estimates, while 72% topped consensus sales estimates. Those are both strong numbers. In terms of future projections, 16% of companies raised guidance, and not one company lowered guidance. That's rare even with the very low number of reports so far.

&gt; While guidance and beat rates were strong, investors still used earnings reports as an opportunity to sell. The average one-day share price change this week for companies in reaction to their earnings reports was a decline of 0.57%. All of those declines came on the initial gap down at the open, however. After averaging a gap down of 0.76% at the open of trading following the earnings release, the average stock that reported gained 0.21% from the open to the close. (The gap down of 0.76% and the open to close gain of 0.21% adds up to the full-day decline of 0.57% mentioned earlier.)

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/earnings.png))**

&gt; Below is a table showing all 32 companies that reported Q2 numbers this week (through Thursday). The list is sorted by one-day share price reaction from best to worst. Alcoa (AA) had the best price reaction to earnings this week with a gain of 6.39% yesterday. WNS Global (WNS) put up the second-biggest gain at 6.36%. The next best-performing stocks in reaction to earnings this week only gained 3%+ -- USB and HOMB. Other stocks that reported this week that gained in response to their earnings reports include Morgan Stanley (MS), Goldman Sachs (GS), Taiwan Semi (TSM), Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), and JP Morgan (JPM).

&gt; On the downside, AngioDynamics (ANGO) saw the worst share price reaction to earnings this week when it fell 11.51% on Thursday. Sleep Number (SNBR) was second-worst with a one-day drop of 9.19% yesterday as well.

&gt; While MS, GS, and JPM all posted gains in reaction to earnings this week, other banks like Citi (C), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Bank of America (BAC) reacted negatively with each falling 4% or more.

# Retail Sales Beat Again

&gt; Retail sales data for June was reported on Thursday, handily beating expectations for the second consecutive month. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, June saw a 7.5% increase month over month, compared with Bloomberg’s consensus expectations for a 5% gain. This comes on the heels of a more than 18% gain in May, but also following by far the lowest reading ever, a 14.7% decline in April.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7.17.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Pent-up demand and the continued easing of lockdowns during June likely contributed to the large increase, which saw sales rise across most categories. Sales spiked 8.2% at auto dealers, but even sales excluding autos and gas rose 6.7%. Clothing store sales more than doubled (+105.1%) while sales in the hard-hit food services and drinking places climbed 20%.

&gt; “Consumer spending is still far below pre-pandemic levels and many of the real-time data we are monitoring have begun to level off in the past month,” said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “We remain encouraged by the strong rebound in May and June, but would expect more gradual gains for retail sales in the second half of the year.”

# Why A Potential Democrat Sweep May Not Be A Market Worry

&gt; Based on the latest polling data, there’s growing consensus that former Vice President Joe Biden potentially may win the election and Democrats possibly may sweep Congress. Some might think this could be a negative for stocks, as a higher corporate tax rate that reduces earnings could be part of the Democratic platform.

&gt; Early writers of the US Constitution were worried about one party having too much power that could enable factions in Washington, DC, to enact more extreme policies and political ideals, upsetting the carefully balanced apple cart. As we noted in our recently released Midyear Outlook 2020, stocks historically have performed quite well when Congress has been split, although stocks actually have done better than most probably realized when the Democrats were in full control.

&gt; “Higher corporate taxes are quite likely should we see a potential Democratic sweep,” said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But to blindly say stocks will do poorly is quite a stretch, as historically stocks have done rather well under this .”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 Index has been higher 9 of the past 10 times and 15 of the past 18 times Democrats controlled both the White House and Congress. Although LPL Research anticipates a likely split Congress in November, with the list of overall worries growing, we don’t think a potential Democratic sweep should be at the top of investors’ list of worries.

# Best of July Likely Over

&gt; NASDAQ’s mid-year rally came to an end on Tuesday, July 14. During the rally’s 12-day stretch beginning on the third to last day of June through the ninth trading day in July, NASDAQ gained 4.7%. This is well above its average performance since 1985 but less than half of its best showing from 1999. At NASDAQ’s high close during the rally on July 10 it was up 6.0%. Historically around this time in July is when the market has begun to weaken as NASDAQ’s full-month average performance is just 0.9% since 1985.

&gt; In the following chart, July’s seasonal pattern over the last 21 years has been plotted with July 2020, plotted on the right axis for comparison through yesterday’s close. This July’s well above average performance so far called for a second, larger range in order to aid in the comparison. Over the last 21 years the market’s trend has been lower beginning right around mid-month through the close. DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 &amp; 2000 have on average given back some or all of their first half of July gains.

87,TSM,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning July 13th, 2020","Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning July 13th, 2020.

# **Market heads into worst earnings season in 12 years amid worries virus is slowing recovery  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/10/market-heads-into-worst-earnings-season-in-12-years-amid-worries-virus-is-slowing-recovery.html)**
*****
&gt; The worst earnings season in years is about to begin, and it’s possible the stock market could shrug off the sharp profit decline, as long as companies see some signs of a recovery ahead.
*****
&gt; Earnings are expected to fall by 44%, the worst quarterly performance since the Great Recession when S&amp;P 500 profits fell by 67% in the fourth quarter of 2008, according to Refinitiv I/B/E/S data. It is also expected to be the worst quarter of the pandemic crisis, revealing the extent of the earnings damage as the economy slumped more than 30%.
*****
&gt; Major financials JPMorgan, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo are among the financial firms reporting. Pepsico starts off the week with its report Monday, and Johnson and Johnson, Abbott Labs and Netflix also report.
*****
&gt; The financial sector is expected to see a more than 52% decline in profits, according to Refinitiv.
*****
&gt; “U.S. companies are about to give us a look into their worst quarter since the Great Financial Crisis,” said Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist at Ally Invest. “But since so many companies aren’t giving earnings forecasts, investors won’t make moves based on earnings alone. They’ll also be looking at trends since the quarter ended. Increasing coronavirus cases, management outlooks, and price performance could all have an outsized impact, and that could lead to outsized market moves.”
*****
&gt; Stocks turned in a mixed performance in the past week, reacting at times to the rising risks to the economy as coronavirus cases continued to increase in some states. The Dow posted a weekly gain of 0.96% while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq were up 1.76% and 4.01%, respectively.
*****
&gt; In the week ahead, there are some important economic reports, including CPI inflation data Tuesday and retail sales Thursday. Last month, retail sales rose a surprise 17.7% but this month economists are watching closely to see if the reversal of some openings and the delays in other is impacting consumer spending.
*****
&gt; But it’s the earnings that could be a litmus test for markets.
*****
&gt; “I think it really comes down to earnings, not what the numbers are going to be. People don’t care about the numbers. They want to hear what the companies have to say,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Adivsory Group. “Tech companies are going to have the most important earnings. Companies like semiconductors, that go into automobiles, computers and cell phones. They’re the ones that have to say our outlook is great, and therefore our stocks deserve to be at all-time highs.”
*****
&gt; Tech company earnings are only expected to fall by 8%. The worst sectors are expected to be energy, with a decline of 154%, followed by consumer discretionary, expected to be down by 114%, according to Refinitiv.

# Does a Weak First Six Months Mean Trouble?

&gt; The wild ride of 2020 continues, with the S&amp;P 500 Index down 20% in the first quarter and up 20% in the second quarter. Much like dropping a 20 dollar bill and picking it up, this doesn’t mean you are 20 dollars wealthier. Down 20% and then up 20% actually comes out to a 4% drop for the first half of the year.

&gt; What does a negative first half of the year tell us? Turns out, gains could be hard to come by the second half of this year. “Although 2020 is like nothing we’ve seen before, the fact of the matter is a weak first half of the year could mean weaker than normal returns for the rest of the year,” according to LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

&gt; In fact, the S&amp;P 500 had been higher in the first six months of the year a record nine consecutive years before being lower in 2020. Since 1950, there were 48 times when the first six months were higher and the rest of the year gained 77% of the time and added 5.8% on average those final six months. Compare that with when the first six months of the year were lower 21 times, the final six months were higher only 52% of the time and up only 1.2% on average.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, a move higher is quite likely after strength in the first six months of the year, while very modest gains could be in the cards if those first six months underwhelm.

# Earnings Season Lurks

&gt; After a relatively quiet week for economic data and practically no earnings reports to speak of, the Q2 earnings season will kick off next week. Normally, earnings season starts quietly with just a handful of reports outside of the major banks, but next week will be relatively busy with some major players on the calendar. Things start off slowly with Pepsi (PEP) on Monday. Tuesday, we’ll get reports from Citigroup (C), Delta (DAL), Fastenal (FAST), JP Morgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC), all of whom are scheduled to report in the morning. Wednesday’s major reports include Goldman (GS), Progressive (PGR), and UnitedHealth (UNH) in the morning, while Alcoa (AA) will report in the afternoon. Thursday will be the busiest day of the week with too many stocks to list here, but Netflix (NFLX) will highlight the schedule of afternoon reports. Finally, Friday’s key reports include Blackrock (BLK) and State Street (STT).

&gt; As far as analyst sentiment stands heading into the current earnings season, while we wouldn't go so far as to say that it has made a full 180-degree turn from last quarter's negative extremes, it has been close. Over the last four weeks, analysts have raised forecasts for 580 companies in the S&amp;P 1500 and lowered forecasts for 419. That works out to a net of 161 or just under 11% of the index. Besides the S&amp;P 1500, six sectors have positive revisions spreads, while just two are negative. Sectors with the most positive revisions spreads include Consumer Staples, Energy, and Technology, while the two sectors with negative spreads are Financials and Real Estate. Financials just can’t find any love these days.

# The ""Miracle"" Nasdaq 100

&gt; For anyone unfamiliar with the 1969 Miracle Mets, the ""Amazins"" were 10 games out of first place as late as mid-August and then went on to win 38 out of their last 49 games to finish in first place over the Cubs. From there, the Mets went on to win the first World Series in the history of the franchise in what at the time was one of the biggest turnarounds in the history of baseball. Ironically, in 2007, the Mets were on the other end of another historic turnaround after they blew a seven-game division lead with less than a month left in the season by losing 12 of their last 17 games. But that collapse is a story for another time.

&gt; Like the Miracle Mets in 1969, the Nasdaq 100 in 2020 has also staged a historic turnaround. After trading up over 10% earlier in the year, the gains quickly evaporated with the COVID outbreak. Within two months, the Nasdaq 100 went from a YTD gain of over 10% to a decline of over 20% by late March. From there, though, the Nasdaq has gone on an epic run, not only erasing all of its losses but also trading to record highs and a gain of over 20% on the year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/2020.png))**

&gt; The frequency of positive days for the Nasdaq 100 provides another illustration of the index's strength this year. So far this year, the index has traded higher on 63% of all trading days. That may not sound like much, but if the year were to end today, it would be the highest percentage of positive days for a given year in the Nasdaq 100's history. On a side note, it's interesting to see in this chart how similar the percentage of positive days has been on a year to year basis over time. There has never been a year where fewer than 46% of all trading days have been positive, and prior to 2020, there has never been a year where more than 62% of all trading days were higher.

# China Charges Higher

&gt; We've highlighted the run in Chinese equities quite a lot in the last several days, but it keeps getting more and more extreme. With a gain of over 1% overnight, China's CSI 300 not only turned in its eighth straight day of gains but also its eighth straight day of rallying more than 0.5%. In the history of the CSI 300 dating back to 2002, there has only been one other time where the CSI 300 saw eight or more straight daily gains of 0.5%. That was back in April 2007.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/070920-CSI-300-Streaks.png))**

&gt; If you don't remember what was going on with Chinese equities back in April 2007, take a look at the chart below. The last time the CSI 300 had a streak of 8+ days of 0.5% daily gains, the CSI had already doubled in the prior six months. From there, though, it went on to nearly double again in the next six months. Eventually the bubble burst, and it wasn't much more than a year later that the CSI 300 was back below where it was in April 2007.

# Gold Cup

&gt; The gold ETF (GLD) has gone through a nine-year drought from new all-time highs, but as it gets closer to its prior highs from September 2011, there are three possible upcoming technical set-ups. The first would be a massive multi-year ""cup and handle"" pattern. You can see the ""cup"" that has been forming over the last nine years. For the ""handle"" to form, GLD would need to go into a sideways consolidation phase from here for a bit. Once that consolidation phase occurs, the pattern would suggest a significant leg higher over potentially years (rather than months).

&gt; The second -- and more negative -- setup would be a bearish ""double top."" This would happen if GLD gets right up to its highs from September 2011 and fails to break through that resistance

&gt; Finally, the third setup would simply be a breakout higher from here. GLD could simply continue moving higher and break right through resistance at its 2011 high.

&gt; Regardless of what happens, the ""cup"" that has been forming for nearly a decade now is something you don't see often. It will be interesting to watch this pattern from a technical perspective over the next few months.

106,TSM,Apple and TSMC,"So Apple will be designing its own silicon... but who will manufacture it? My first guess is TSMC, which already supplies the chips for the iPads. But Apple doesn't like to be dependent on its suppliers, and has a habit of either buying them, or switching between them to keep them on their toes.

At 280B market cap, TSM isn't ""cheap"", but Apple has the cash, or can trivially get financing at today's low rates. If it makes sense to design you own silicon, why not also manufacture it? The vertical integration would save costs, while also potentially denying Android competitors a chip vendor, which would likely drive up their costs as competition shrinks. (Long Samsung if this happens?) Or just keep selling chips to the competition and make money off Android sales too!

Even if Apple doesn't buy them, it's likely they will manufacture more chips for Apple, so long TSM.

If the performance of the custom silicon is as good as promised, Apple will gain a huge and quite durable advantage over everyone except Samsung, who has their own chip fab. So, long AAPL too.

88,TSM,"King Bond Market Long $TLT, Bear Oil Fossil Fools and thus almost every sector ETF, selling a put of 5G companies","From the $BLK DD guy that rolled into $XLF last month.  I am currently long $SLV, $GLD, $GDX, and $GDXJ with call spreads, shares, and just pruned $AMZN and $AAPL gains but keeping $ARKF, $ARKQ, and $ARKK (ETFs with $TSLA as the largest holding.) 

Today, Friday's CNBC ""Options Action"" has just dangled calls on the $TLT, the ETF that tracks the 20+ year \*BOND PRICES move inverse to yields and the Fed would not mind rates to hit 0% to spark inflation.\*  I concur with CNBC who suggested buying August dated call spreads on $TLT.  

My $XLE long dated puts have been melting up.  I am short every sector ETF but $IBB and $XLV.  Be careful as these options are not as liquid as the $QQQ or $SPY but I cannot help that sectors are moving down when oil is down.

The VIX is holding steady, steady high.  I am not hedging with the $VIX when stay home stonks work- the $VIX is broken imao so use $GLD, $SLV, and $TLT because bond rates are going to 0% (meaning the price goes up.)

I also concur with CNBC that options are the best way to play a market by reducing risk like selling a put.  There are risky options, and very safe options if you can own 100 shares (the company could be $DTEGY Deutsche Telekom AKA T-Mobile/Sprint and the bringer of 5G eventually, pick your poison.)

I suggest selling a put for some good companies with solid balance sheets, 5G capabilities, and anything auto in the green space to get 100 shares of companies (see the next paragraph.) 

My suggestions for getting 100 shares at a cheaper price would be Ericsson (trading under $10,) Dell or VMWare (you pick the one that matches your risk,) NIO (trading below $10), $NOK at $4 is interesting,  and for big rollers Amazon (if you have the $ to own 100 shares at $2,500 or $250,000 or less, I would but that is for r/wsb)  That is, if Amazon retests $2,500.  I suggest 100 shares of $SHLL for YOLO if this bores you as this is the best $SPAC (but there is probably other ones because management is all you have with blank check companies.)  

AFTER you own 100 shares of $AAL or $TSM or Dell or whatever, you can dump the 100 shares anytime.   I suggest you keep them and sell options and join the theta gang.  Why not get paid for owning your 100 shares of $TSM \[Taiwan Semiconductor, the company onshoring manufacturing to America\] you got at $45?  $TSM August 21 $45p is $.35.  If you had 100 shares of $TSM today, selling a $60c gives you $140 just for holding the shares until August 21st.  

Bullish on onshoring green jobs because Trump leaving office is the biggest buy after the news ever.  (Buy on the rumor sell on the news but in reverse because solar employs more than fossil fools in TX pre COVIDcession.)

For examples of selling a put:  $AAL Nov 20th $2 puts are $0.14 (You are agreeing to buy 100 shares of $AAL at $2/share before or on November 20th, if you are not asked to buy $AAL you keep your $0.14 collateral and the full $14 credit.)  

A shorter dated long put $AAL Aug 21st put is $0.09 ($9.)   Or you could buy the death puts on $AAL but JPow exists, hence zombie companies, like Hertz, so that is just blowing money.  $AAL has the highest %age interest on their debt and the CLOs (their bond insurance) were the highest, I have to check again ($AAL is the worst, but not as bad as $HTZ, a worthless zombie stock.)  

\*BOND prices move inverse to yields so going from 0.5% to 0% makes the price go up\*  Zombie companies with balance sheet nightmares is what keeps bond prices upper bound at 0.8 but lower bound is 0%.

Worthless zombie stocks include banks, fossil fools, and then by default industrials, and I hate to say that I am only long $XLK and thinking of $IBB.  Every day that oil is not above $35 or in the green or both is a day stonks tank.  Every stonk will fall after earnings.  Short individual stonks going into earnings, wait- all stonks have cancelled earnings.  See why I think maximum protection by not going long the VIX but long gold, silver, even transition phase metals, copper, and BONDS.  

$NEM, $GLDI, $SLVP, $HL, $SAND, $SA, $GLTR, $PALL, $SPPP, $SSRM, $BTG , $PPLT, $PLTM, $NUGT, $BAR, $FNV all up today \[I also have $GLNCY, $SBSW, and $PLG.\]  Why own these when you can just long $GDX and $GDXJ?

I do think rates will remain positive, until they are not positive anymore, AKA Japan and Europe :).  What BOND fund would you long or short and why, besides $TLT?   If a 100 year bond comes out, the interest rate will be 0% anyways in the long run, but we are dead in the long run, so long live bonds until we decarbonize the economy, tax the rich, and pigs fly (not happening fast enough.)   Ray Dalio and many others have been harping about this, and a broken clock is right twice a day, or a bear is right when we are in a bear market with a broken VIX.

The bond market is king compared to the stonk market in sheer $.  And ForEx trades trillions a day and  is important (on days the $DXY, the basket of the dollar versus the globe) goes up $GLD should ease and is a time to buy the dip, and on days the $DXY goes down $GLD will gap up during this ""bear oil/hospitality/planes"" market.)   When the $DXY goes down, it takes more dollars to buy the gold/silver/copper/materials, and $GLD rises and is very liquid for options.  Thinking August to add to my Dec 31st $160c.  That is, unless we are going to allow millions to go into poverty, so then just buy guns and physical gold and we can trade scraps of silver.

Fossil fools, the slow pace of massive renewable energy projects, and both candidates tripping overthemselves to be more anti-China during global warming and upcoming food inflation spell the need risk reduction (if you plan on holding equities please buy puts to hedge.)

TL;DR $TLT August call spreads, $TLT is the 20 year bond ETF.  Pick companies you want to own 100 shares of by selling a put while long $GLD and long $SLV print money so holding the 100 shares prints money joining theta gang.",7,6,1593233075.0,2020-06-27T04:44:35+00:00,t3_hgnbcr,SmallStreetBets

292,TSM,Apple supplier TSMC to build a $12 billion chip factory in the U.S.," [https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/15/tsmc-to-build-us-chip-factory.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/15/tsmc-to-build-us-chip-factory.html) 

&amp;#x200B;

**Summarized**

&gt; Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co said on Friday it will build a semiconductor facility in Arizona, as concerns grow in Washington about the security of the technology supply chain which is largely centered in Asia.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Construction is planned to start in 2021 on what would be TSMC's second manufacturing site in the U.S. The factory will be focused on producing so-called 5-nanometer chips, the latest in semiconductor technology being manufactured today.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;TSMC's decision to build a new U.S. chip plant comes as President Donald Trump's administration continues to scrutinize the global technology supply chain upon which American firms rely on.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;In particular, the government has sought to reduce reliance on China, a feat that may not be so easy, experts previously told CNBC. During his presidency, Trump has also looked to bring manufacturing back to the U.S. While TSMC is a Taiwanese firm, it does have plants in China and has big Chinese customers such as Huawei.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;The Trump administration was considering a rule earlier this year, that if implemented, would require companies using U.S. chipmaking equipment to apply for a license before supplying Huawei, according to a Reuters report in March.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;""This deal bolsters U.S. national security at a time when China is trying to dominate cutting-edge tech and control critical industries,"" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a tweet.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;TSMC said it decided to build the new plant with the ""Mutual understanding and commitment to support from the U.S. federal government and the State of Arizona."" ""This project is of critical, strategic importance to a vibrant and competitive U.S. semiconductor ecosystem that enables leading U.S. companies to fabricate their cutting-edge semiconductor products within the United States and benefit from the proximity of a world-class semiconductor foundry and ecosystem,"" the company said in a statement.",22,3,1589576637.0,2020-05-15T21:03:57+00:00,t3_gkhhic,stocks

DJIA Reverses 835
 
POWELL Says, “No Neg Rates”, BUT
 
 
Today’s market was down from the start with the initial and continuing claims numbers, but it only lasted for 45 minutes before the market started back to the unchanged mark.  We chopped around until 1:00PM and then we were above the prior close to stay.  We finished +377.37 (1.62%), NASDAQ +80.55 (.91%), S&amp;P 500 +32.50 (1.15%), the Russell +4.30 (.32%) and the DJ Transports +37.54 (.48%) and still -471 (5.65%) for the week.  Market internals were anemic for an 835 rally at just over 1:1 on both exchanges.  DJIA was 25 / 5 higher with no losses of over $3 DPs while gainers were UNH +86, AXP +39, HD +29, V +26, and JPM +24 DPs.
 
While Jay Powell said, “not looking at negative rates,” they really have no control over the markets.  As our rates remain higher than others, we continue to be a magnet for the massive amount of money looking for a home.  He may not be considering them, but he can’t really enforce the issue without some very unattractive methods of monetary controls, which, BTW, never work.

# **Banks and health care companies will report earnings, but virus updates will matter most in week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/09/banks-and-health-care-companies-will-report-earnings-but-virus-updates-will-matter-most-in-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; Major banks and health care companies will be the first to reveal how the early weeks of the coronavirus shutdowns impacted their profits, outlook, work force and customers.
*****
&gt; Earnings season begins in the week ahead, with JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Johnson &amp; Johnson among the first to release first quarter earnings reports Tuesday. But the stock market that appears to be willing to overlook anticipated bad news for now.
*****
&gt; “Most of the slowdown occurred in March,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. “Do we react to the hypernegative economic data we see? What we do react to is any semblance of guidance. There is no clarity about duration of the economic slowdown. You’re going to see a preponderance of companies pulling their guidance for the calendar year ... I think it’s going to be more companies doing that, than not.”
*****
&gt; Stocks bounced higher in the four-day pre-Easter holiday week, with the S&amp;P 500 up 12.1%, in the best week since 1974. Investors reacted to signs that new cases of the virus may be peaking in U.S. hot spots and Europe. The stock market also got a boost Thursday from the Fed’s announcement of a $2.3 trillion in programs to help the economy.
*****
&gt; The market will turn its focus to earnings in the coming week, but there are also some important economic reports, including March retail sales. The virus shutdowns resulted in a rapid closing of many retail establishments, a sudden drop off in gasoline sales, and a steep decline in auto sales. That has resulted in a forecast for a 7% decline in March retail sales.
*****
&gt; “People are more interested in news about the spread of the virus than they are about the economic data,” said Hogan. “We got another massive increase in jobless claims. That’s ignored because we’re listening to who is plateauing ... Is New York actually getting better and we see a peak? I get the feeling people are going to look at the first quarter earnings and say, ‘we know this and you should pull your guidance.’”
*****
&gt; Before March, analysts had expected an increase of several percent in first quarter earnings. According to Refinitiv’s I/B/E/S, the forecasts and some actual numbers point to an 8.1% decline. For the second quarter, earnings are expected to decline about 20%, while economists expect an unprecedented 30% contraction in GDP during the quarter.
*****
&gt; Weekly claims data will also be important, now with nearly 17 million claims filed in just three weeks. Economists expect millions more to be filed for the week ending April 11.

&gt; Other major banks report in the week ahead, including Citigroup, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs on Wednesday. Hogan said companies like JPMorgan may be able to reveal how the Fed’s programs are working, both those for small business lending and others that were intended to help the credit markets.
*****
&gt; Earnings for financial companies are expected to be down 13.7%, according to I/B/E/S data. Communications services companies are expected to have fared the best in the first quarter, with an expected 7.8% earnings gain. Health care companies are expected to see a modest gain of 1.6%.
*****
&gt; The market will also watch Johnson &amp; Johnson and Abbott on Thursday, as they discuss not only their results but potential developments with coronavirus-related therapies or products. J&amp;J is working on a potential coronavirus vaccine, while Abbott has a new test kit for the virus.
*****
&gt; ’That’s going to be the more intriguing aspect of the conference call when Abbott talks about their new test kit and how fast it is, and what they can produce,” said Hogan.
*****
&gt; Analysts are also watching to see whether companies discuss ways they are cutting back costs. “As we go through the earnings season, what we’re concerned about is what companies are going to cut their dividends,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.
*****
&gt; UBS Global Wealth Management strategists said in a note that 51 companies, accounting for 27% of 2019 aggregate buybacks, have suspended their repurchase programs. More capital was returned to shareholders via buybacks than dividends.
*****
&gt; “As a result, dividend payout ratios are somewhat low compared to other regions. So despite the expected sharp decline in profits for 2020, we expect more modest dividend cuts of 6-8%,” the UBS strategists wrote. “For now, we are assuming that the Federal Reserve does not require US banks to cut or suspend their dividends. We expect further dividend cuts in the consumer discretionary, energy, and real estate sectors. Healthcare, segments of tech, and consumer staples will likely report token dividend increases.”
*****
Krosby said as the earnings season goes on, investors will be watching ways the economy could begin to return to normal.
*****
“The market is moving in phases right now. The most important phase is the virus itself,” she said. She said it will matter a lot that New York continues to show positives, like a plateauing of cases and fewer hospitalizations.
*****
Eventually companies will be able to talk about moving forward . “Are they seeing anything in terms of green shoots? Any positives? These are going to be very important as we go through the earnings season,” Krosby said. “That is complimented by when do we lift the restrictions on going back to work, and the polling data will be critical on when Americans feel comfortable going back to work, going back to a more normal environment.”

# Big Annual Declines Are Rare

&gt; Stocks have rallied nicely off the March 23 lows on the back of a bold policy response from the Federal Reserve (Fed) and lawmakers in Washington, DC, which was followed by signs that a peak in growth of COVID-19 cases may come soon. At Wednesday’s close, the S&amp;P 500 Index stood 19% above the March 23 closing low but down 17.7% for the year. That begs the question whether a positive year is possible with a pretty big hole still left to dig out of.

&gt; “A positive year for the S&amp;P 500 is still possible but will require a steady recovery in economic growth and corporate profits in the second half of the year,” noted Jeffrey Buchbinder, LPL Financial Equity Strategist. “We remain hopeful that COVID-19 can be contained over the next month or two and enable the US economy to begin to open up early this summer, but it’s just too early to tell.”

&gt; As we see in the LPL Chart of the Day, big down years are rare. In fact, since 1950, the S&amp;P 500 has fallen more than 15% just four times (1973-74, 2002, 2008).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Big-negative-years-are-rare.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; All indexes are unmanaged and cannot be invested into directly. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

&gt; So might 2020 look like 2009, a big up year for stocks as the worst of the financial crisis passed and markets looked ahead to recovery? That year the S&amp;P 500 was down 25% year to date before rallying to end the year higher. Or is this another 1973-74, or even 2000-2002, with stocks in the doldrums for an extended period?

&gt; Given the possibility that the bear market catalyst might be removed over the next couple of months, we expect the bear market recovery to be relatively swift by historical standards—potentially faster than the 20-month average and hopefully closer to the non-recession bear market recovery average of 10 months. The key to a possible rebound, beyond timely containment of COVID-19, will be investor confidence in recovery. The bold policy response, part of our Road to Recovery playbook, is helping bridge many businesses to the other side of the crisis.

&gt; We think chances are good that 2020 ends up being closer to the middle of the accompanying chart rather than the far left. During these uncertain times, it’s important for investors to keep in mind that markets are forward looking. The latest bounce off of the late-March lows provided evidence that market participants are doing just that. We don’t know if a durable stock market low is in just yet, and volatility may pick up again as more bad economic news and corporate stress is revealed. Our resolve is being tested, we but we remain optimistic about prospects for a strong recovery in the second half of the year.

# Good Friday Trading: Strength Before Weakness After

&gt; Tradition can provide some solace in these historic and trying times. So as the Hirsch household grates fresh horseradish root among other family traditions to prepare for our first tele-Seder on Zoom for the first night of Passover tonight I like to wish everyone a sweet Passover and a happy, healthy and safe Easter.

&gt; In keeping with our traditional seasonality posts, here is the update on the trading patterns around the Good Friday NYSE Holiday. I took the picture above of the mosaic on the interior of the dome of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Old City of Jerusalem in August 2018 on our family trip for my oldest son’s bar mitzvah. It seemed apropos for today.

&gt; Good Friday is the one NYSE holiday with a clear positive bias before and negativity the day after. DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 all have solid average gains on the day before but are all net losers on the day after Easter since 1980. NASDAQ has been notably strong, up 18 of the last 19 days before Good Friday with the one loss occurring in 2017.

&gt; The day after Easter has the worst post-holiday record though average losses are steeper after Presidents’ Day. The S&amp;P 500 was down 16 of 20 years from 1984-2003 on the day after Easter but is has been up eleven of the last sixteen years.

# Gold Up, Dollar Down

&gt; For a majority of the past year the US dollar has been fairly range bound, but the massive move away from risk assets more recently led to major buying for what is globally considered a safe haven currency. From its 52 week low and high on March 9th and March 20th, respectively, the dollar index rose 8.28%. But since that peak just before the equity market's bottom, the dollar index has come back down; currently ~3.25% below that high.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Dollar.png))**

&gt; With the dollar lower, another safe haven that tends to trade inversely has benefited: gold. Since late February, the yellow metal had struggled to break out to new highs, but this week it has finally broken out. Currently, gold is at its highest level since late 2012.

# All or Nothing Days on the Rise

&gt; We consider an 'all or nothing day' to be a day where the net daily breadth reading (daily advancing stocks minus declining stocks) for the S&amp;P 500 is above +400 or below -400. While these types of days were practically non-existent in the 1990s, beginning in the early 2000s, their frequency started to rise with the increased popularity of trading in the S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY). Whereas investors used to buy and sell individual stocks, the increased popularity of SPY moved the market more towards the type of environment where investors were buying and selling the market.

&gt; All or nothing days also increase in frequency during periods of increased market volatility, and that trend has been no different this time around either. The chart below shows the 50-day moving average of all or nothing days going back to 1990. Over the last 50 trading days, more than a third of all trading days have been all or nothing days. The only two other times where the average was higher in the last thirty years were in December 2008 and November 2011. The average got close to current levels back in late 2015 and early 2016 but was never able to quite get above 33%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/040820-All-Or-Nothings-50-DMA.png))**

&gt; Looking at the frequency of all or nothing days on an annual basis shows another interesting trend. So far this year, there have been 19 all or nothing days for the S&amp;P 500. We may be barely a quarter into 2020 so far, but this year's total already ranks above more than half of the 31 years since 1990. In fact, the S&amp;P 500 is currently on pace to have 70 all or nothing days in 2020, which would tie 2011 for the most ever in a given year. It's only April, but 2020 is shaping up to be the year of record volatility.

# Volatility Remains High

&gt; Given the big rally off the lows of late March, we've had a number of questions related to the VIX and why it remains high. As of Tuesday afternoon, the VIX was in the mid-40s which is very high relative to readings over the last decade but actually down significantly from its recent highs above 80.

&gt; The reason the VIX is still in the 40s is because the market remains volatile. While volatility is typically associated with markets that are moving lower, it can actually go both ways, which is exactly what we're seeing now. The charts below do a good job of illustrating just how extraordinary the market's swings have been in recent weeks. In many cases, it's unlike anything anyone reading this has ever seen before.

&gt; Over the last five weeks, the S&amp;P 500's average absolute daily percentage change has been +/-4.8%. That's higher than we saw at the height of the financial crisis, after the 1987 crash, and in the late stages of the Great Depression. The only time the S&amp;P's average daily move over a five-week period was greater was after the Crash of 1929.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/040720-Avg-Daily-Change-25.png))**

&gt; Tuesday's rally also puts the S&amp;P 500 on pace for its 13th straight day of moving up or down 1% or more. That's a longer streak than anything seen during the Financial Crisis and just two shy of the 15 straight days we saw in October 2002 at the lows of that bear market. Before that, though, the only other period where there was a longer streak of 1% daily moves was during the Great Depression.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/040720-Streaks-of-1.png))**

&gt; While 13 straight daily 1% moves is extreme by any measure, what makes this current streak even more notable is that it would be the second 13-day streak of 1% moves in the last 27 trading days. That's right, from 3/2 through 3/18, the S&amp;P 500 went 13 straight days of moving up or down 1%. Then, on 3/19, the S&amp;P 500 broke that streak by rallying just 0.47%. Since then, though, it's been 1% all the time again with the S&amp;P 500 on pace for its 13 straight daily move of 1% again. Looking at this another way, in the last five weeks (25 trading days) the S&amp;P 500 has seen a 1% move 24 times. The only other time that has occurred was during the Great Depression when there were two separate occurrences.

# Semis Holding Up Relative to Market

&gt; In a post yesterday, we noted that the relative strength of semiconductors versus energy had finally eclipsed its record high from the dot-com boom in March 2000. Semis have not only exhibited relative strength versus the energy sector; they've demonstrated strength versus the broader market as well. Take the relative strength of the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) versus the S&amp;P 500. In the early stages of the market decline from the February highs, semiconductors saw a sharp drop in their relative strength, but in late March, the SOX surged relative to the broader market and actually hit a record high on March 24th. With Technology playing an increased role in the stay-at-home and work-from-home economy, it makes sense that semis would hold up relatively well.

&gt; From that high on 3/24, we saw a modest pullback in the strength of the semis relative to the S&amp;P 500, which then bounced again in recent days. Going forward, the key for the semis is over which level it breaks first. Will it be the March high or the short-term low three days later on 3/27 that followed. Whichever way it breaks will likely dictate which way the broader market goes as well.

# Health Care Gets No Booster Shot From Sanders

&gt; Bernie Sanders dropped out of the Presidential race today, and while his chances of ever securing the nomination were slim to none, his dropping out does reduce a small amount of uncertainty. The chart below illustrates this trend as the Vermont Senator's odds to win have dropped dramatically since Super Tuesday.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Sand.png))**

&gt; As we have noted in the past, the odds of winning for the more progressive candidates on the Democratic ticket have typically had an inverse relationship to the Health Care sector's performance because their policies are more likely to shake up the business model of companies in this sector. Despite that relationship, Health Care stocks saw little in the way of a boost from Sanders dropping out of the race. There wasn't a single point in the trading day today where Health Care was the top-performing sector in the S&amp;P 500, although its performance relative to the S&amp;P 500 did pick up slightly in the afternoon after the Sanders announcement.

# **Trade deal and earnings season could shape the market’s next moves  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/10/trade-deal-and-earnings-season-could-shape-the-markets-next-moves.html)**
*****
&gt; The stock market’s race to new highs could be put to the test in the coming week by two events — the signing of a phase one trade deal with China and the start of corporate earnings season.
*****
&gt; Stocks have been gaining steadily since it became clear late last year that the U.S. and China reached a truce and would agree to a phase one deal, rolling back some tariffs and avoiding new ones. But details of that deal have never been made clear, so markets will be focused on any information that will clarify how it will be implemented and what checks and balances there are to ensure compliance.
*****
&gt; The market has also reached a lofty premium that could be challenged if earnings disappoint, though analysts widely expect to see the majority of companies able to beat lowered expectations.
*****
&gt; Banks are first up with J.P. Morgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo releasing earnings Tuesday, and Bank of America and Goldman Sachs reporting on Wednesday. Earnings could be a slight positive for the market, analysts say.
*****
&gt; “I think earnings are going to be a good component,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. “Companies have lowered the bar enough to where I think most of the companies will easily step over it, and we’ll all have a sigh of relief that the earnings this quarter won’t be as bad as it could have been. It won’ be strong. We’ve seen revisions across all of the sectors come down.”
*****
&gt; According to Refinitiv, fourth quarter earnings are expected to be down 0.6%, based on results of companies that have already reported and estimates for others that have not.
*****
&gt; Stocks started out the past week worried about a blowup in the Middle East, after the U.S. killed Iran’s top general. But by midweek, tensions dissipated and stocks were higher. On Friday, stocks sold off again, after a lackluster jobs report, though the Dow briefly topped 29,000 for the first time. The S&amp;P 500 was up 0.9% for the week, at 3,265, and the Dow was off 0.7% at 28,823.
*****
&gt; The China trade deal is expected to be signed on Wednesday, and while it may be a nonevent, it has the potential for surprises. The deal most likely will be seen as a positive, but it is not expected to do much to curb technology transfers, which are expected to be part of the next phase discussions.
*****
&gt; “If the deal is more watered down than anticipated, if there’s skepticism about how China will adhere to its promises” it could be negative, Arone said. “There’s skepticism already. If there’s something in the details that suggest doubt about how are we going to police this or how are we going to enforce this, I think that could cause markets to move some.”
*****
&gt; Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group said he thinks the market has moved past the trade news. “I think they’ll try to emphasize some IP protection. I honestly think people have already moved on,” he said. President Donald Trump has also lowered expectations by noting that the next phase of the deal would not come until after the election.
*****
&gt;# Economy
&gt; Markets also will focus on some of the upcoming data in the week ahead, particularly CPI inflation data Tuesday and retail sales for December on Thursday.
*****
&gt; Core CPI is expected to increase by 0.2%, putting the annual pace at 2.3%, and retail sales are expected to rise by 0.3%.
*****
&gt; “The holiday season when all was said and done should have been pretty good. You had low gas prices, rising wages and a super tight labor market. It has to be good,” said Joseph LaVorgna, Natixis chief economist Americas.
*****
&gt; There is also a parade of Fed speakers in the coming week, but they are unlikely to offer any clues about when the Fed will move off the sidelines. Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren, who voted against the Fed’s rate cuts three times last year, speaks Monday. There are a half dozen more appearances by other Fed officials, including Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan, who speaks Wednesday.
*****
&gt; LaVorgna said the Fed could begin to focus more on the rapid rise in the stock markets, as Kaplan did this past week. “It seems to me the hawks might worry about financial instability and the market being excessively exuberant,” said LaVorgna.

# January Expiration Week: Mixed Bag Last 21 Years

&gt; Over the past thirty-seven years, since 1983, the S&amp;P 500’s performance during January’s option expiration week has been a tepid. Friday has been up 21 and down 16, and the entire week has been down five-plus times for every four times it has been up. However, in the past twenty-one years (1999-2019), the S&amp;P 500’s performance has taken a turn for the worse with expiration day falling ten times with an average loss of .08% and the full-week declining 14 times with an average loss of 0.74%. DJIA and NASDAQ have similar track records since 1999.

# 378 Days since Last 10% S&amp;P 500 Correction &amp; Still Counting

&gt; There is little doubt that 2019 was a good year for the market. DJIA advanced 22.3%, S&amp;P 500 climbed 28.9% and NASDAQ jumped 35.2% in 2019. Even for a pre-election year, those gains are above average. Gains of this magnitude also have a tendency to cause some uneasiness as valuations are generally getting stretched and thoughts turn to profit taking or the possibility of a pullback or a correction.

&gt; S&amp;P 500 completed its last correction (defined as a 10% or greater decline, but less than 20% because that would be a bear market then) on December 24, 2018 after falling 19.8%. That was 378 calendar days ago and it was the fifth correction of the current bull market that begun on March 9, 2009. Since 1948, the current bull market is the second longest in duration and magnitude. The longest was 4494 calendar days from December 4, 1987 through March 24, 2000. S&amp;P 500 gained 582.1% during that bull while enduring five corrections. Even though it has been 378 days since the last does not mean one is imminent. S&amp;P 500 has gone as along as 2553 calendar days without a correction before (October 1990 through October 1997).

# How Stocks Do During Geopolitical Events

&gt; It was a volatile night for the U.S.-Iran conflict.

&gt; S&amp;P 500 Index futures dipped 1.5% and global markets swung after Iran shot several ballistic missiles at U.S.-Iraqi military bases. Markets recovered their losses overnight on news that there were no American casualties, but tensions remain high in the Middle East.

&gt; As concerns over the Iran conflict continue to build, we’ve received many questions asking what this could mean for the market outlook. We discussed our initial thoughts regarding the conflict in our January 6 blog, but we believe it is important for investors to remember that there have been many times historically when stocks stood strong in times of conflict. In fact, the best ever annual Dow Jones Industrial Average gain was in 1915 during World War I.

&gt; “No doubt worries over Iran have investors on edge,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Stocks could be volatile for a while, but the impact to stocks from geopolitical events historically has tended to be short-lived.”

&gt; As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&amp;P 500 fell 5% on average in 20 major geopolitical events dating back to the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. However, the S&amp;P 500 recovered those losses in fewer than 50 calendar days on average.

&gt; A special thanks to Sam Stovall of CFRA for sharing the data below with LPL Research.

# Why The First Five Days Of 2020 Could Have Bulls Smiling

&gt; The first five days of 2020 are in the books. Although the headlines have been quite scary, equities have picked up right where they left off last year. In fact, after the first five trading days of the new year, the S&amp;SP 500 Index is up a respectable 0.65%.

&gt; Jeffrey Hirsch of The Stock Trader’s Almanac follows and tracks many interesting seasonal patterns. One that we find very interesting states that how stocks perform the first five trading days of a new year could indicate how the full year will go. Now, we’ll be the first to admit no one should invest based only on this adage, but the results have been quite compelling.

&gt; We did some research and found that when S&amp;P 500 returns in the first five trading days of a new year have been higher, the full-year total return for the S&amp;P 500 has been positive 80% of the time. Compare that to returns being up only 60% of the time when the first five days have been lower, and we have something that has our attention. What about big gains? Well, when those first five days have been up more than 2%, the full year return has been positive a very impressive 16 of 17 times! Only 2018 didn’t follow suit when the first five days were up 2% or more.

&gt; “Should you ever invest for a full year purely because of the first five days? We would emphatically say no,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But put in context, this seemingly random bit of info does have a very impressive track record. It is only a small piece of the pie, but the good news is we still don’t see any major warning signs that this bull market is over just yet.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, when the S&amp;P 500 has gained more than 0.65% the first five trading days of a new year—like 2020—the full year has finished in the green 31 out of 35 times, with a very solid 17.2% average annual return. Although we aren’t expecting gains quite that large in 2020, it does help support the case for the bull for at least the rest of this year.

# ""Take my crude, please""

&gt; Crude oil is just about as popular or maybe even less popular than tobacco these days. Sure, there was a brief spike in prices following the US drone strike on Iranian general Soleimani last Thursday night, but ever since then, crude oil has done nothing but trade lower. Just the fact that crude only managed to rally 3% in the lead up to what many thought to be a full-blown war with Iran shows just how out of favor crude is. This isn't the first time crude hasn't been able to hold onto gains either. As noted earlier this week, besides the last week, there have been two other periods of heightened tensions between the US and Iran over the last year where one would have expected prices to rally, but instead they sold-off.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011020-Crude-Chart.png))**

&gt; When a stock consistently opens at one price and then closes lower than it opened, it's considered a negative as it signals that investors are selling into strength. Applying that logic to crude oil confirms just how out of favor it has become. This week alone, the daily closing price has been lower than its open on all five days. The chart below shows daily streaks where crude oil closed below its opening price going back to the start of 2009. While the current five-day streak isn't anything to write home about, we would note that even before this past week's tensions in the Middle East, in late September/early October there was a streak of 13 trading days where the commodity closed lower than it opened, and that was the longest losing streak since at least the early 1980s! Before that, there was another streak of 7 trading days in July. In other words, two of the five longest streaks since 2009 where crude oil closed below its open both occurred in the last six months.

# Dow 29,000?

&gt; By posting this, we're probably jinxing it, but the DJIA is on the verge of topping another 1,000 point threshold less than two months after first topping 28,000. While the media makes a big deal of each of these thresholds, we would note that the road to 29,000 from 28,000 is only 3.4%. That's hardly a momentous move. Since Trump became President in January 2017, though, 29,000 would be the 10th 1,000-point threshold that the DJIA would cross under his watch.

&gt; The table below lists the date that the DJIA first crossed each 1,000-point threshold throughout history. For each level, we also include the number of calendar days that elapsed between the first cross of that threshold and the prior one, how large a percentage gain that the 1000-point threshold represents versus the prior one, and then how many times the DJIA has crossed each threshold (on a closing basis) both to the upside and downside. One of the most notable aspects of the table in our view is that even though each threshold is a smaller percentage than the prior one, there have been so few crosses (above and below) of most of the thresholds since the Dow first crossed 19,000 after the 2016 election. 19,000 was only crossed once, and six of the other nine thresholds since then haven't been crossed more than ten times. That's indicative of a market that has been rallying and not looking back.

Following the US’ attack on several top Iranian officials in Iraq, energy prices have spiked higher, supporting **energy stocks (CVX, XOM, SLB, XOP, XLE)** and defence stocks such as **Lockheed Martin (LMT)** whilst weighing on **airlines (LUV, DAL, AAL)** in addition to dampening appetite for risk in general, **banks (XLF, BKX, JPM, WFC, C, BAC)** particularly will face pressure from the Treasury curve’s bull flattening. With Iran vowing a swift response, participants are cautious of further geopolitical escalation which could see these asset price movements continue, although desks are also cognizant of previous flares of conflict which have proved short-lived in regard to market reactions, such as the swift reversal of oil prices following the attacks of Saudi’s Abqaiq oil facility in September 2019.

#DOW

**Apple Inc. (AAPL)** has had its PT raised to USD 330 both at BofA (prev. USD 290) and RBC (prev. USD 295). BofA analyst Wamsi Mohan cites third-party data as indicating strong double-digit YY growth in App Store revenue, in addition to other positive revenue trends.

107,TSM,Earning's whisper most anticipated earnings list culled for option traders.,"A huge list to cull this week. This is earningwhisper.com's ""most anticipated"" earnings for this coming week culled out for option traders.

This is my opinion of options that I'll consider for earnings plays. Not a recommendation and I don't have advice on what type of play you should open.

If you didn't catch the previous posts, every week someone is kind enough to post the graphic from earningswhisper.com for upcoming earnings. While I find it a great starting point, the list isn't well suited for option spreads without a lot of gutting. I used to do this and keep it to myself, but others find value, so I'm sharing it. My reasons for cutting out companies may not match your own, so I listed the reasons why I removed it.

**The final cut list is first.**

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) and Samsung Electronics (SSNLF) [are Applied Materials’s major customers](http://marketrealist.com/2015/01/applied-materials-detailed-business-overview/), contributing about 30% of their revenue. Intel (INTC) is also a key customer.

Look back at each of these companies last ERs and you'll see they're all killing it - beats on top &amp; bottom with *raised guidance*.  Where is a part of that raised guidance business going to?  **AMAT.**

Now here's where the legit DD comes in, [peep this report from ICInsights released yesterday](http://www.icinsights.com/news/bulletins/Will-Samsungs-2017-Semi-Capex-Deliver-Knockout-Blow-To-Competition/)

'IC Insights’ latest forecast now shows semiconductor industry capital spending climbing 35% this year to $90.8 billion.

After spending $11.3 billion in semiconductor capex last year, Samsung announced that its 2017 *outlays for the semiconductor group are expected to more than double to $26 billion.'*

**'Bill McClean, president of IC Insights stated, “In my 37 years of tracking the semiconductor industry, I have never seen such an aggressive ramp of semiconductor capital expenditures.  The sheer magnitude of Samsung’s spending this year is unprecedented in the history of the semiconductor industry!”'**

I sold out of my Nintendo holding after the 4% pop this morning, lowered my stake in Micron, and used the funds to go balls deep in AMAT's ER.  Bought in @ 56.30 pre-market, it's not to late to join in fam.

116,TSM,stockAday: can AMD overcome the apathy? $AMD,"Today we are looking back at $AMD, a stock we totally missed in June 2016. Sorry.

When the stock was at $5 we asked: [Is there hope for AMD, long-term?](https://www.reddit.com/r/stockaday/comments/4p0kg7/is_there_hope_for_amd_longterm_amd/) Clearly, yes, with the stock at $13 today.

Back then we concluded:

&gt; In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 88%. That's despite revenues in the March quarter off 19% to $832M. Personally I am at a loss as to why the strong performance. 

What happened next? At the June quarter AMD stopped going backwards, sales rose single digits. In Sept quarter it was double digit growth. And the stock rose steadily as high as $15 in Feb.  

So what next?

|PE ratio | -ve | 130x | n/a | 

And as with many tech stories, when the top line starts growing at double digit rates, the near term PE valuation looks ludicrous. We'll have to think long term!

# What's so exciting about AMD?

Well, they used to be the _also ran_ in the microprocessor industry. Always chasing Intel. And when it comes to graphics processing units, they were always chasing Nvidia. But substantial R&amp;D over many many years has finally paid off... with a set of products that are starting to gain traction!

Though let's not get too excited, Intel and Nvidia are the behemoths in those two markets. And then there is ARM, now owned by Softbank.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. | $4,619M | -ve | -ve
Intel Corporation | $61,711M | 40% | 20%
NVIDIA Corporation | $8,344M | 34% | 44%

So they are still the _challenger_ even though the stock price has surged!

# How are the numbers looking?

As I said above, it's a turnaround story. 

|Metric|2012A|2013A|2014A|2015A|2016A|2017E|2018E|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $5.4bn | $5.3bn | $5.5bn | $4.0bn | $4.3bn| $5.0bn | $5.7bn|
|EPS | $-1.60 | $-0.11 | $-0.53 | $-0.84 | $-0.60| $0.10 | $0.31|

The expectation is they can add $700m a year to the topline with some nice operational leverage. 

And just in case you are wondering about their ability to generate cashflow, well, there is over $500m of net debt on the books, so we shouldn't expect any cashflow to come back to us as dividends in the near future.

# Cheap, no.

Let's look at the figures for 2018, when AMD is expected to earn over 30 cents a share. At 40x earnings it's not a bargin, but if the moment is there, with market share gains and margin gains, it's not a shocking price.

Peers|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
AMD.O | $12,706M | 40x | N/A | 0% | N/A
Peers |||||
INTC.O | $185,047M | 13x | 9% | 3% | 13%
NVDA.O | $107,622M | 45x | 12% | 0% | 2%
Other Semis |||||
TSM | $189,812M | 18x | 15% | 3% | 13%
AVGO.O | $97,711M | 15x | 18% | 2% | 6%
TXN.O | $89,044M | 22x | 10% | 2% | 8%
MU.O | $44,975M | 5x | N/A | 0% | 0%

If we do our standard back-of-the-envelope, assuming earnings go up 20 cents a year, i.e. $0.10 ,$0.30, $0.50... for 30 years and discount it as 8% then the net present value is worth over $20 a share.

And if we look at sales multiples it's trading on 3x in line with Intel and a substantial discount to NVDA at 13x.

So, the valuation doesn't look expensive, given the turn-around. Though clearly it is not a bargain.

# Watch out for dilution

Back in 2016 they issued a convertible. It's way in the money, with owners able to convert their debt at $8 a shares. The further the stock rises the bigger the next dilution to common stock holders. 

And on top of this they've a strategic investor who dumped stock in [August](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-emirates-mubadala-amd/abu-dhabis-mubadala-sells-second-stake-in-u-s-chipmaker-amd-idUSKBN1AK0NA) still has a substantial stake. So there is a headwind here, as these folks sell down.

# Wall Street doesn't care

The professionals on Wall Street have a $14.23 for AMD, i.e. a paltry 6% upside. Despite 4 quarters of double digit growth, their recommendation to clients is _Hold_. 

Though we have to remember that Wall Street has been in catch up mode for over 2 years, with a target price below the share price and a hold recommendation all the time. 

Seems that they, like me, missed the inflection point.

# Are we too late?

Fortune favors the brave. A year ago, you'd have been brave. 

Today, not so. I can see the potential to double my money within 5 years. If the current trends are sustainable. Though it's no longer a moonshot. 

If you are a believer in their market position vs Intel and Nvidia, then I can see why you'd be willing to buy. But if you think they are still a me-too chip maker, then best you stay away. 

Like a year ago, I'm stuck on the fence. I just don't understand the tech well enough to make that call. Sorry.

# 1. Looking at the chips

Applied Materials provides manufacturing equipment, services and software to the  semiconductor, display and related industries. So it's an interesting play of the technology business. They aren't the chip maker, or the person who sells the chips inside the phones. They are the folks that make the equipment that makes the chips. Tangential eh?

They've 4 divisions, but the Semis biz is the key, both it terms of sell kit and supporting clients.

1. Semiconductor Systems, 60% of sales, where they sell their kit
2. Global Services, just over 20% of sales, where they are supporting and upselling to the existing clients
3. Display and Adjacent Markets, just under 20%, which is their LCD screen equipment, etc
4. the Corporate and Other segment, which includes solar cells etc, though this is less than 2% of sales.

Of course, you won't be surprised that 85% of sales are in Asia. and just 10% in the US, and the rest in Europe. With TSMC in Taiwan making up over 15% of sales. Samsung, Micron and Intel over 10% each. Imagine, their top 4 clients are 51% of sales. 

Looking at revenues and profits, it's been beautiful the last three years! And looking at the forecasts for the year to October 2017, it's expected to get wildly better.

|Metric|2012A|2013A|2014A|2015A|2016A|2017E|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|

|EPS | $0.09 | $0.21 | $0.87 | $1.12 | $1.54 |$3.08|
|DPS | $0.35 | $0.39 | $0.40 | $0.40 | $0.40 |$0.41|

Though for some strange reason, this isn't filtering through to an increased dividends :( Well, I suppose we shouldn't complain, they did $2bn of buybacks, versus $450m of dividend payments. Though with all that cash-flow pumping, it's hardly a surprise that they are in a net cash position.

# 2. Better Picks 'n' Shovels

When it comes to the peers, everyone's got a specialty, an edge. But clearly AMAT's at the more commodity end of the business model. And if we look at their big clients, we can see they aren't more profitable than their customers.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Applied Materials, Inc. | $12,942M | 26% | 36%

Micron Technology, Inc. | $17,401M | 40% | 18%
Intel Corporation | $60,481M | 39% | 18%

And how does this filter thro' to valuation? It doesn't. Margins seem to be irrelevant to the valuation. Growth rates seem to be irrelevant. Dividends too! 

Though, there's ASML, which is in an oligopoly position (lithography a story in its own right), and there's the rest.

# 3. Love boring?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $50 target for $AMAT which is a 20% upside. So no wonder their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. And the stock trading at 13x is at the lower end of it's 12 to 18x forecast earnings range. And they typically beat earnings by a cent or two every quarter!

Though as bullish as Wall Street is, they've not drunk the Kool-Aid as management have:

&gt; Today, many new demand drivers are emerging that layer on top of traditional computing and mobility, technologies like the Internet of Things, big data and artificial intelligence are transforming industries, including transportation, health care, entertainment and manufacturing. The way these industries create value is increasingly dependent on capturing, transmitting, understanding and storing data. In turn, this means they are more and more reliant on advanced semiconductors. 

# 4. Rising tide?

Management talks about the industry's growth being sustainable and the position of AMAT being sustainable. So a rising tide is lifting all boats? Especially AMAT? Sitting on a 3 bagger in 2 years, ""long-term shareholders"" gotta be happy, but do I jump now in now? 

All the fundamentals look good, the valuation looks reasonable, so it's hard to argue with the bulls! Sure, you can worry about China every now and again, or spot a weak quarter, but does that stop the rising tide? Doubt it.

But if you do buy, watch the industry like a seasoned mariner. The tide always turns. The Semi business gets nasty quickly, sales can plummet, plunging the leaders into lose. And maybe that explains the low single digit valuations, and low dividend payout ratios... anyone with more than a 5 year memory, has seen Semi ships flounder before.

119,TSM,stockAday: Any inside Intel? $INTC,"In the post-PC world, has Intel an eye on the future?

# 1. What do thay do? 

Semiconductor chips. mainly!

If you are under 30 you may have missed the *Intel Inside* logos that came with every PC in the 80s and 90s. There was an axis called Wintel where Microsoft and Intel dominated, Microsoft Windows was the software, Intel the semi-conductors, and some ""dumb"" manufacturer put it all together into a box... then the smartphone hit. 

Has it hurt them? Hardly from a cashflow perspective, though it has killed off growth.

Metric|2016A|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $59bn | $55bn | $56bn | $53bn | $53bn|
|EPS | $2.12 | $2.33 | $2.31 | $1.89 | $2.13|

When they describe their business, there are six exciting division names: Client Computing Group, Data Center Group, Internet of Things Group, Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group, the Security Group, Programmable Solutions Group, and the New Technology Group. But the business is still driven by the old chips for PCs, etc business (55% of sales) and the data center / communications unit (29% of sales) with none of the other 4 divisions clocking more than 5% of sales. 

But having missed the smartphone race, which was *won* by ARM, Intel is now betting big on autonomous cars. In April they agreed to spend $15bn to buy Mobileye, a ""global leader in the development of computer vision and machine learning, data analysis, localization and mapping for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous driving.""

Will it work? Hard to tell. And Google, Tesla, Uber and a rake more folks are also playing in this space.

But let's look at the forecasts 2 years out, we can see they are starting to pick up!

Metric|2016A|2017E|2018E|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $59bn | $60bn | $62bn | 
|EPS | $2.12 | $2.86 | $2.97 | 

And if you are worried about INTC spending $15bn on Mobileye, note they currently have only $8bn of net debt, i.e. 0.4x it's latest operating profit. Plus they are selling their Security unit for $4bn. So it's balance sheet isn't stressed post deal. Therefore I can't see any reason to doubt their ability to keep paying nice divies and keep on buying back stock.

# 2. How do they compare?

Compared to the *old enemy* AMD they continue to dominate, in sales, margins and returns... but that's missing the point, as the semiconductor world has moved on. 

Versus the rest of the sector their margins look reasonable, but clearly they aren't best in class. 

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Intel Corporation | $60,481M | 39% | 18%
Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. | $4,424M | -7% | N/A
Broadcom Ltd | $15,608M | 30% | -15%
NVIDIA Corporation | $7,542M | 32% | 38%
Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (ADR) | $32,534M | 64% | 26%
Texas Instruments Incorporated | $13,764M | 46% | 38%
Micron Technology, Inc. | $14,733M | 32% | 5%
Analog Devices, Inc. | $4,006M | 35% | 11%
Skyworks Solutions Inc | $3,353M | 41% | 25%

But the margin doesn't seem to be the factor to watch... it's the fear of low growth. They are the only single-digit grower in the pack. 

Peers |Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
INTC.O | $171,125M | 13x | 8% | 3% | 13%
AMD.O | $10,622M | 144x | N/A | 0% | -3%
AVGO.O | $101,228M | 16x | N/A | 2% | 3%
NVDA.O | $88,066M | 48x | 12% | 0% | 3%
TSM | $182,724M | 16x | 10% | 3% | 13%
TXN.O | $81,584M | 21x | 10% | 2% | 8%
MU.O | $34,528M | 7x | N/A | 0% | 12%
ADI.O | $28,902M | 18x | 16% | 2% | 7%
SWKS.O | $19,956M | 17x | 16% | 1% | 7%

Can INTC re-ignite their cash-flows? Maintain the cashflows in the *legacy* business, and find new engines of growth? 

# 3. What's Wall Street thinks?

Despite INTC under performing the S&amp;P for the last few years, the brokers still like the stock and say *Buy*. Though their price target at $40 is only 10% above the current price.

Back in February management outlined a 3 year plan that focuses on efficiency, growth, better capital allocation and shareholder returns. All sensible stuff. So it's surprising that Wall Street isn't more excited, surely?

Note: the stock's traded between 11 and 16 times forecast earnings over the last year, so it's not feeling toppy at the moment. And management haven't missed earnings in over 3 years. 

# 4. Inside Intel?

How often is a cash cow, like Intel trading on 13x times? A cashcow where management has one eye on the next big thing, autonomous cars, and the other eye of increasing shareholder returns.

To me it seems like Wall Street isn't cutting them any slack. And unloved quality stocks are ones that tempt me! Sure, it may take 2 years for the success / failure to crystalize... but if I wait, surely I'll miss it?

120,TSM,1 month performance - 5 different portfolios,"As a new investor, about a month ago, I decided to create 5 different portfolios that pretty much represent different approaches (or ideas) to investing in general. Now before I continue on, I do realize that 1 month performance has no indication for long term results. But I would still love to share the portfolios performance with you and see what you think. Actually it's a bit more than 1 month, but still.

1. ""Best of SPY"" - In this portfolio, I sorted the S&amp;P 500 holdings by weight, and then only added the ones that are trending up (using MACD) on a 5 years view. [Performance - +1.82%](https://i.gyazo.com/bccabcbbba0efe8fe755df2a23fbeb70.png).
Smybols: MSFT,XOM,JNJ,GE,AMZN,FB,T,PG

2. ""Magic Formula #1"" - Top 5 stocks that had the best score by the Magic Formula. [Performance - +3.25%](https://i.gyazo.com/dd98aa5b292b5743d517d803a9418bbe.png)
Symbols: STX,FSAM,CLCT,PDLI,QIWI

3. ""Benjamin Graham"" - This portfolio is made of the top 5 stocks that had the best score according to Benjamin Graham's formula. [Performance - +7.58%](https://i.gyazo.com/d5300819251997162d52b368df5186f8.png).
Symbols: ENIA,KEP,LPL,SKM,TM

4. ""Screening criteria"" - This portfolio is just me playing around with Google Finance's stock screener. I basically chose a few criterias that financially made sense (such as p/e ratio, div yield, ROI etc). [Performance - +2.34%](https://i.gyazo.com/6c25849dff8f4bb58cd577eaab1253f6.png).
Symbols: DL,BTI,EQM,TSM,FII,ABBV,LVS,QCOM,CSCO,OMAB

5. ""Magic Formula #2"" - In this one, once again I sorted all stocks by their score in the Magic Formula, then only chose stocks with market cap of above 1B and finally only added them to the portfolio if they were trending up (also 5 year view). [Performance - -0.53%](https://i.gyazo.com/6ad6b1238196234c6d09b61cda6e4f5a.png).

Well I'm not sure that my little experiment has any contribution but I'm still enjoying checking these portfolios from time to time. ",2,6,1469119587.0,2016-07-21T16:46:27+00:00,t3_4txxys,investing
121,TSM,Goldman Cuts Global Smartphone Growth Forecast,"http://blogs.barrons.com/asiastocks/2016/02/01/goldman-cuts-global-smartphone-growth-forecast/?mod=BOL_da_rta

""Our current Apple estimates point to 1% yoy growth in CY16, a sharp deceleration from 26%/20% growth in CY14/15 respectively… Our analysts forecast a 1% decline in Samsung’s smartphone shipments. Apple and Samsung combined account for 39% of the smartphone volumes and 95% of the total smartphone market revenues. TSMC (TSM) expects 8% smartphone growth, while Qualcomm expects 10% growth in 3G/4G devices (which is a category more expansive than just the smartphone market, as it includes other connected devices).

Xiaomi’s shipments of around 70.8mn were up ~25% yoy; however the company missed its target of 80-100mn smartphones for the year. DigiTimes reported that Xiaomi’s shipments won’t grow much this year, as the company plans to focus on costs and improving the software in its smartphones, rather than market share. Xiaomi is about 5% of the market, according to Gartner.""",4,7,1454425985.0,2016-02-02T15:13:05+00:00,t3_43ull6,investing
122,TSM,How is it that ETFs make money? (aside from capital appreciation),"I'm currently learning the ins-and-outs of investing 101. There has been an enormous amount of reading on my part. My research has helped me learn a lot of things I had no idea were a thing.

For instance, most people know that to make money on the stock market, one may use the ""buy low and sell high"" strategy. But I only just learned an alternative strategy, ""buy and hold"", to hang onto the stocks to receive dividends, which are the stock owners share of the business' profits. I am learning how to valuate the stock price based on the Earnings Per Share (Net Income) and the Book Value (Equity). So that is beginning to make some sense, and I like the direction Dividends is taking me.

Now I am trying to learn how dividends work with respect to Exchange Traded Funds. It's a little more confusing, probably because ETFs are bundled and there's more information involved per share.

For instance, on Schwab's site, for the ETF *Schwab U.S. Large-Cap Growth (SCHG)*, there is a table ""Dividends and Yields"". The values are:

* Next Dividend Payment: $0.1407

* Next Pay Date: Sept 25, 2015

* Previous Ex-Date: Sept 21, 2015

* Distribution Yield: 1.22%

* SEC Yield (30 Day): 1.07%


Farther Down, there is another set of data called Quarterly Total Return:

 * SCHG Market Price: 11.94%

 * SCHG Nav: 11.96%

 * Large Grown (Morningstar Category): 12.75%

 * DJ US TSM Large Cap Growth TR USD (12.04%)

Then, under the prospectus, under Summary Prospectus, I have found Annual Total Returns:

 * 2013: 33.96

 * 2012: 17.02

 * 2011: 0.67

 * 2010: 16.84


Finally, under the prospectus, under Annual Report, I have found Performance at a Glance:

 * Market Price Return: 25.14%

 * NAV Return: 25.16%

 * Dow Jones US Broad Market Stock Index: 24.74%

 * ETF Category Morningstar Large Blend: 23.09%


Questions I have: 

 1) Do all ETFs with stocks make dividends? Or do some not work that way?

 2) If not all ETFs make dividends, is there another way they make money, aside from capital appreciation? Is it possible to earn passive income from all ETFs?

 3) Does anyone know which numbers (from the above schwab example) are relevant to learning what dividends to expect from an ETF?

 4) Are ""ETF Dividend Funds"" supposed to generate *more* dividends for investors than other ETF funds? If not, then why are they called Dividend Funds? (ie, Scwab's Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF SCHD)",7,15,1443031814.0,2015-09-23T18:10:14+00:00,t3_3m3fyc,investing
123,TSM,What do you guys think about TSM?,"Hey everyone, 

I was taking a look at TSM today. They're priced at 23.39, which is about 2 points lower than its 52 week high. Pays a dividend of 2.12%, a P/E under 20, with steady increases in net revenue and net income over the past 5 quarters, and an A+ credit rating from S&amp;P. They've also invested over $34 billion over the past 5 years growing their manufacturing capacity. For me, a downside is that it's company based in Taiwan. I got burned hard on YGE last year so my emotions are telling me to stay away, but my brain is telling me that they're a solid company financially who have grown fat over the past 5 years and is poised to continue.

What do you guys think?

25,TSM,Additional counterparty risk with ADRs,"Hi

I would like to invest in TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company), but my current broker does not have access to the TWSE exchange that it's traded on.

There is, however, an ADR, traded on the NYSE as TSM.

The investment is a long-term one, so I'm particularly concerned about additional counterparty risks. What happens if any of the middlemen between me and TSMC goes bankrupt? Will I lose my stock in the company?

Is it accurate to think of an ADR as a derivative, created by a US bank, that tries to match the price of the underlying security? If that is the case, it seems I could get in trouble if the issuing bank is in financial trouble, and it's forced to liquidate some or all of the stock underlying the derivative, to pay off senior creditors. Or are there regulations that give me, as an investor, a guarantee that this won't happen (however much that may be worth)?

Thanks :)",2,0,1387193278.0,2013-12-16T11:27:58+00:00,t3_1t01t5,investing
125,TSM,A tech stock not discussed here much: TSM,This stock recently beat earnings expectations last week but reported flat margin estimates for the next few quarters.

127,TSM,"Put $5k into a Roth IRA, leave as cash or put into stocks with how the market has climbed?","So I made sure to open a Roth IRA for the 2012 tax year and put $5k in (23 here). The market has definitely rallied compared to a year ago (wish that I had $5k to put in then). This money is obviously in for the long haul (50+ years). 

What I would want to know is should I leave this as cash for now, anticipating that the current market rise is peaking and want to keep my capital for a year or two to enter at a lower point? Go for a TSM type fund and assume that the market will continue to rise overall compared to this point? Target a few underperforming companies and go for those? Stick with blue chips that give good dividends? What would /r/investing recommend.",4,34,1369757600.0,2013-05-28T16:13:20+00:00,t3_1f7f2p,investing
128,TSM,Where should I open a Roth IRA? (Schwab vs Vanguard vs others),"23 here looking to open up a Roth IRA and be very aggressive with it. I know that Vanguard has some good ETF's and other index funds, but isn't necessarily that aggressive. I have a Schwab account I actually was gifted so was thinking of just doing it there, but don't know if any other accounts would be good?

Also for an aggressive strategy should I just be buying mostly large cap stock by itself? Or would it be more worthwhile to just buy a TSM mutual fund",12,15,1365440321.0,2013-04-08T16:58:41+00:00,t3_1bxe0j,investing
26,TSM,How to tell when something is already priced into a stock?,"I recently started learning about investing. I've made a few purchases, and I'm trying to understand how to determine whether a potential scenario is priced into a stock or not.

As an example, I purchased Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) when I began hearing about Apple's relationship with Samsung souring. I knew I wasn't the first person to have this thought, but I struggled to figure out whether the potentiality of getting a share of Apple's chip production was priced in.

Another example would be Apple's stock. It appeared to me that Steve Job's health concerns were well priced into the stock before his death, because his death did not have a dramatic effect on the price.

Can anyone provide any insight? My investing strategy has been a pretty traditional value investing strategy and I'm trying to expand my horizons.

**EDIT**: I now understand the question is basically ""How do I beat the market?"", but I'm hoping there could still be some good discussion below.",2,14,1327798413.0,2012-01-29T00:53:33+00:00,t3_p14lb,investing
