5,DELL,Hnrg is the next big play,"### 🚨 HNRG: The Most Undervalued Data-Center Power Play in America Right Now 🚨

While everyone is chasing the usual suspects (SMCI, VRT, DELL, IREN, CORZ) at 50–100x sales, there’s a tiny $350M market-cap company quietly positioned to become **the backbone of Indiana’s AI/data-center explosion** — and it’s still trading under $9.

**Hallador Energy (HNRG)** owns the 890 MW Merom coal-fired power plant in Sullivan County, Indiana — one of the few large, dispatchable, already-permitted power stations sitting in the heart of the Midwest data-center gold rush.

Here’s why HNRG could legitimately turn patient investors into millionaires over the next 3–5 years:

1. **Indiana is the new Ohio/Virginia for hyperscalers**  
   - 30+ hyperscale campuses under construction right now  
   - Amazon’s $11B New Carlisle campus, Google Fort Wayne, Meta Jeffersonville/Lebanon, Microsoft La Porte… the list keeps growing  
   - Combined demand projected to exceed **10 GW by 2030** — more power than the entire state of Indiana uses for residential today

2. **Merom is perfectly located &amp; already permitted**  
   - Sits on the Indiana-MISO grid where the new load is exploding  
   - Has existing 765 kV transmission lines — something new builds will wait 5–10 years for  
   - Fully permitted for coal → gas → nuclear conversion pathways

3. **The company is pivoting FAST**  
   - Q3 revenue +40% YoY, swung to $0.56 EPS profit  
   - Already signed LOIs to add **525 MW of new gas-fired generation** at Merom specifically targeted at data-center customers  
   - Management openly states they are in “multiple active discussions” with hyperscalers and co-developers for the remaining ~600 acres and power capacity

4. **Insanely cheap valuation**  
   - Current market cap ≈ $350M  
   - Forward 2026–2027 EBITDA guidance (just from existing coal + new gas) already points to **$150–200M+**  
   - That’s &lt;2.5x EBITDA while pure-play power providers to data centers trade 15–40x  
   - Plus they own 9+ million tons of coal reserves and Sunrise Coal — basically free optionality

5. **The millionaire math is stupidly simple**  
   If HNRG simply gets valued like the average data-center power provider (20x EBITDA) on just the **existing** Merom expansion plans → $3–4B market cap = **10x–12x from today**.  
   Add in potential nuclear SMR co-development or a full take-private by a hyperscaler and you’re looking at 20–50x territory.

Short float is still ~8.5% and dropping. Institutions have barely touched it. Most retail still thinks “coal = dead.”  
Meanwhile the same people paying 80x sales for air-cooling companies are missing the actual bottleneck: **electrons**.

$HNRG is the classic “hidden gem” setup:  
- Tiny float  
- Explosive secular tailwind (AI power shortage)  
- Catalyst-rich next 12–24 months (new PPAs, gas plant FID, potential nuclear announcements)  
- Trading at depression-level multiples

I’m not saying it happens tomorrow. But the same way $MRO and $APA made oil &amp; gas millionaires in 2021–2022, the next wave of AI infrastructure millionaires will come from the companies that actually deliver the megawatts.

Do your own DD, but HNRG screens as one of the highest asymmetric bets in the entire data-center food chain right now.

Who else is loading the truck under $9 while nobody’s watching? 👀

4,DELL,Why Super Micro computer is the obvious play,"Super Micro Computer (SMCI) remains a high-conviction play in the AI infrastructure space, leveraging its rack-scale server expertise and tight Nvidia partnerships to capture explosive demand. Despite a post-earnings dip to ~$42 (down ~10% on Nov 5), the stock trades at an undemanding valuation, setting up asymmetric upside as deferred revenues unlock in Q2. With a massive &gt;$14B order backlog and expanding manufacturing capacity, SMCI is positioned for multi-year growth in the AI data center buildout—think hyperscalers upgrading to Blackwell GPUs at scale.

Q1 FY26 Results &amp; Updated Q2 Guidance: Q1 revenue came in at $5.02B (miss vs. $6.09B est., -18% QoQ), with EPS at $0.35 (vs. $0.41 est.), pressured by ~$1.8B in deferred rack shipments tied to customer validations and supply chain timing. Margins held steady at ~14.5%, reflecting cost controls amid volume ramps. However, the real story is the new Q2 guidance, upgraded in the earnings call to reflect full deferred recognition: official range of $5.9B–$6.2B, but management explicitly signaled “double-digit potential” (10B+), driven by Q1 deferrals + accelerated Blackwell system deployments. Analysts (e.g., Rosenblatt, Barclays) model $9–11B for Q2—a ~100% QoQ surge—aligning with FY26 full-year outlook now raised to ≥$36B. This isn’t organic weakness; it’s a classic timing shift, with no lost orders.

Current Valuation: At $42, SMCI trades at a rock-bottom ~0.7x FY26 P/S (on $36B rev guidance), vs. peers like Dell (1.2x) and HPE (1.0x)—and that’s before baking in the Q2 upside to 40–44B annualized run-rate. Forward P/E ~15x on expected $2.80+ EPS, with ROIC accelerating on AI margins. The dip embeds bearish fears of volatility, but ignores the backlog’s strength and capex tailwinds (Malaysia/USA factories at full tilt).

Historical Pattern &amp; Catalysts: SMCI’s playbook is consistent: Q1/Q2 “misses” on deferrals (3/3 since 2024), followed by Q3/Q4 beats (avg. +10% vs. est., +50–180% stock gains over 3–12 months). Q2 here mirrors Q1’24’s setup but with 2x the backlog and Nvidia’s GPU guarantees. Key catalysts: Blackwell validation completions (Dec), hyperscaler wins (5+ in queue), and no major bottlenecks.

45,DELL,Microsoft signs $9.7 billion cloud deal with IREN as AI demand swells,"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-signs-9-7-billion-110844856.html

&gt; Microsoft has struck a $9.7 billion deal with data-center operator IREN that includes access to Nvidia's advanced chips, aiming to ease ​the computing crunch that has kept the tech giant from fully cashing in on the ‌artificial intelligence boom. The news sent shares of IREN up as much as 24.7% to a record high on Monday, ‌with the stock last up nearly 10%. AI-server maker Dell was also up about 1%, as it would provide IREN with Nvidia's GB300 chips and other equipment that Microsoft will use for about $5.8 billion. The five-year Microsoft deal shows the AI industry's growing hunger for ⁠computing power to run applications such ‌as ChatGPT. It follows earnings from major tech companies last week that underscored capacity shortages were limiting their ability to fully benefit from the boom.

&gt; Partnering with IREN ‍would allow Microsoft to expand computing capacity without building new data centers or securing additional power - two of the biggest hurdles slowing its ability to meet surging AI demand. It will also sidestep heavy capital spending on ​chips that will lose value as newer, more powerful processors arrive. Such demand has propelled so called ‌""neocloud"" companies such as CoreWeave and Nebius Group - which sell cloud computing services built on Nvidia's processors - ahead in the AI race. Microsoft recently also signed a deal worth $17.4 billion with Nebius for infrastructure capacity.

&gt; IREN, which had a market value of $16.52 billion as of last close after a more than six-fold surge in its shares this ⁠year, has multiple data centers across North America with ​a total capacity of 2,910 megawatts. The company said the ​Nvidia processors are scheduled for phased deployment through 2026 at its 750-megawatt Childress, Texas, campus, alongside new liquid-cooled data centers designed to deliver about ‍200 megawatts of critical ⁠IT capacity. Cash from Microsoft's prepayment will help finance part of its $5.8 billion Dell deal, IREN said. Its Microsoft contract could be terminated if it fails to meet ⁠the delivery timelines.",137,10,1762229761.0,2025-11-04T04:16:01+00:00,t3_1onxxr6,stocks

5,DELL,Last Chance NVTS Lottery Tickets,"TLDR: Navitas is a US-based semiconductor company that uses better power conversion than competitors while demand grows. New designs, major contracts, and upcoming earnings make it a great buy right now unless you’re scared of the casino.

The AI bull run is still showing no signs of stopping. Major names like NVDA and ORCL have largely fulfilled their opportunities to moon at this time, leaving smaller, more speculative companies on the betting table. AI has raised several accompanying sectors in its rally, including companies that feed into its need for power, data centers, and semiconductors.

This is where Navitas Semiconductor (NVTS) comes in. Robinhood leads its description as, “engag[ing] in the development of ultra-efficient gallium nitride (GaN) semiconductors.” GaN semiconductors are the technological successor to silicon power conversion which is quickly becoming antiquated among systems that demand cool, compact, power-efficient semiconductors. 

They are not the first to use GaN technology; however, they do produce the only GaN, fully integrated circuits under their trademark GaNFast™ monolithic integrated chips. This differs from competitors (e.g. IFNNY) because NVTS produces a fully GaN product as opposed to GaN components bottlenecked by silicon parts in the final product.

Another pro is that they work directly with companies to integrate themselves into final products as opposed to being limited by distributors or as components. Essentially, their existing partnerships with big names like Lenovo, Dell, and SolarEdge are designed to work around them—a system design that secures a long-term destiny for the company considering no one can switch away from them on a whim as it would mean completely redesigning their products.

Obviously, their most important deal with Nvidia is the recent milestone that may have put them on some of your radars with them commissioned to provide the semiconductors for their new data centers set to be built in late 2026 or early 2027. The first samples are expected to be shipped sometime this quarter.

With semiconductors being used in just about everything technologically relevant nowadays—computers, phones, EVs—it’s not far-fetched to believe they will be securing additional deals from other big names. They have the most power-efficient system available to date at a time whn every major growth sector is looking for power solutions. 

As for other catalysts, earnings are fast approaching (AH, 11/3) when their revenue has trended up each quarter. Growing geopolitical tensions and administration’s desire to limit offshore dependence may see the power shift from dominant foreign entities like TSM to domestic. The climate is poised to return NVTS to their ATH of $20.16 or well past.

In terms of risk, they are still currently unprofitable entailing some dilution risk. Competition among larger names like Infineon and Texas Instruments is still possible, although my thesis regarding the growing reliance on and demand for GaN suggests the odds are on Navitas’ side.

My recommended position: Jan 16 calls ATM. NVTS more than has the potential to exceed ATH before the end of this year.

46,DELL,Yahoo Finance says no AI Bubble,"This is from Brian Sozzi, Executive Editor at Yahoo Finance:

Can we stop with all this AI bubble talk, please?

I get it.

Those hunting for a dot-com style stock market explosion want to make names for themselves by predicting a bubble. Who doesn't want the fame and fortune associated with being right in a big way?

Who doesn't want to spend a month reporting on stocks going down 75% because of a freak warning out of Nvidia (NVDA) and OpenAI (OPAI.PVT)?

Entire years could be made for content platforms in a week if the stock market were to get blown up because of a Lehman-like meltdown in tech valuations. If you are over the age of 40, you remember the trading screens during the height of the great financial crisis. Massive declines, a full-on sea of red. Every. Single. Day.

But I'm here to say we have to give these AI bubble predictions a rest. Ditto the predictions that we are in a tech bubble. It's just not what's happening out there yet.

First of all, AI is a real technology being deployed in real ways inside of Corporate America.

Second, this technology is requiring more physical assets in the ground, which are being built to support AI's real-world application. What Zach Dell (son of Michael Dell) is working on at startup Base Power (which just raised $1 billion) impressed me this week. It's addressing a key issue: power availability and costs in part because of rising stress on the grid due to AI development.

Next, the spending on AI infrastructure doesn't strike me as reckless.

I talk to CFOs and they walk me through their thinking, which seems logical. They aren't foaming at the mouth with wild-eyed predictions of grandeur similar to the late '90s.

Plus, the tech giants making the biggest AI investments are fueling their ambitions with cash on hand; not loading up balance sheets with debt. The upstarts in AI are well funded, not being 100% stupid in their organizational build-outs. They're working on tangible technology that has actual orders behind it.

""I would say that's probably thinking too small,"" AMD (AMD) CEO Lisa Su told me about concerns of AI overspending this week. ""You have to really look at what the power of this technology can do for the world.""

AMD is ""investing at the right pace because we want to accelerate ... this is a place where [and] when companies and partners make bold moves, it will be rewarded.""

Who am I to argue with Su, who may go down as one of the best tech CEOs of all time? What she has done at AMD since joining in 2012 is mind-blowing.

Lastly, let's talk about AI worrywarts' warning calls about valuations.

According to new research out of Goldman Sachs this week, the median forward P/E ratio across the ""Magnificent Seven"" is 27 times, or 26 times if excluding Tesla (TSLA), which has a much higher multiple than the other companies. This is roughly half the equivalent valuation of the biggest seven companies in the late 1990s, and the dominant companies in Japan (mostly banks) traded at higher valuations still.

What's more, the current enterprise-to-sales ratios are also much lower than those of the dominant companies in the late 1990s.

""So it is true that valuations are high but, in our view, generally not at levels that are as high as are typically seen at the height of a financial bubble,"" said Goldman Sachs strategist Peter Oppenheimer.

I couldn't agree more, Peter.",178,182,1760288524.0,2025-10-12T17:02:04+00:00,t3_1o4ufmv,stocks

9,DELL,PE ratio of top 20 market cap 1999 vs 2025,"
With all the bubble talk, I wondered what the top 20 market cap companies' P/E looked like in 1999 compared to the top 20 today. I also included the rate of return through 2006, so this avoids the 2007–08 crash.

Take this for what you will.

Average P/E in 1999: 54
Average P/E in 2025: 48

5 companies from 1999 are still in the top 20 today: Exxon, Walmart, Microsoft, J&amp;J, and Oracle
In 1999, 3 companies had P/Es over 100. Today, only Tesla is above 100.
Tesla stands out with the highest PE of the 40 data points and continues to confound me.

All you have to know is this is the future for Ai infrastructure… many big companies are trusted partners (NVDA, SMCI, DELL, and more). Not only that but a 15 year contract with Coreweave that is estimated to rack them in 11 billion. Could be way more, this stock is undervalued heavily. Hope this helps you out!!

47,DELL,How do you see the whole AI bubble playing out?,"OpenAI, Anthropic, etc. are entrenched in Google Cloud, AWS, Azure, Oracle, Dell, whatever. They are significantly driving up the cloud revenue of these companies, which in turn buy from Nvidia. Investors keep pouring billions into the AI companies, which keep engaging in price wars with each other and spend whatever little they have left on R&amp;D and paying absurdly high salaries in the name of superintelligence.

When, not if,  this bubble bursts and investor funding dries up for the unprofitable companies, what the hell happens? Call me naive but I just don't see a world where chatgpt doesn't exist anymore or one where people use less AI in the future. Even though the LLM companies are not ideal investments, their products are ridiculously good and it is no secret that all the corporations in the world, say in 10 years, will have significantly higher automation than it does today.

My guess is that these big ones (example OpenAI) are almost too big to fail. If there are concerns about liquidity Sundar or Satya or Zuck would probably swoop in to strike a deal with them. Given this assessment and the idea that the world tomorrow would use more AI than it does today, probably a good idea to invest in something like Dell I think, which is currently at a P/OCF of 13 and pouring large amounts into making data centers. In the alternative that some of these big ones fail, I still think there would be someone else to fill the gap and data center companies would stay afloat.

Curious to hear your thoughts. Thanks!",228,347,1759386211.0,2025-10-02T06:23:31+00:00,t3_1nvw7lt,stocks
7,DELL,DD: why i am all in BITF,"Bitcoin Mining to Gov-Grade AI Cloud?

1. Board Appointment Signals a Pivot

On Aug 18, 2025, Bitfarms appointed Wayne Duso (ex-AWS &amp; Dell) to its Board.

Why this matters: Duso helped scale AWS GovCloud and Dell’s $B+ businesses. His expertise is hyperscale cloud + government compliance (FedRAMP, FISMA, DoD IL5/IL6).

Speculation: Bitfarms may be lining up federal certifications for its Panther Creek (PA) site. These are must-have for handling sensitive workloads like defense AI model training.

Quick primer:

FedRAMP High → secure federal cloud for sensitive but unclassified data.

FISMA High → compliance for “severe consequence” data breaches.

DoD IL5/IL6 → Controlled Unclassified Info (IL5) and Secret (IL6) – critical for DoD AI workloads.

Add Duso’s background → very plausible Bitfarms is positioning Panther Creek for Gov/DoD AI contracts (think AWS-style premium pricing).

2. Revenue Potential – AI Cloud vs. Mining

Industry benchmarks (2025):

AI Data Centers: ~$12.5M/MW gross → ~$5–7M/MW net in PA.

Colocation: ~$1.3–1.5M/MW (TeraWulf).

CoreWeave (PA): ~$6M/MW.

Texas &amp; NY AI Cloud: $4–6M/MW (more volatility + higher energy costs).

Panther Creek specifics:

1 GW potential → scale to 500+ MW.

Nuclear + hydro power at $0.02–0.03/kWh via PJM grid (super cheap).

80% NOI margins if certified + locked with a hyperscaler (Amazon, etc.).

At $5–7M/MW, Panther Creek could generate $2.5–3.5B/year net if 500 MW is deployed.

3. Quebec Pilot – AMD MI300X Advantage

Early 2025, Bitfarms repurposed part of its Saint-Hyacinthe (QC) site (~50 MW) for AMD MI300X racks:

Memory Edge: 192 GB HBM3 vs. H100’s 80 GB → fewer GPUs needed for large models.

Cost: $15–20K vs. $30K+ H100 → ~20–30% lower TCO.

Efficiency: 750W TDP; Quebec pilot hit 85% GPU utilization on vLLM inference.

Software: ROCm 6.0+ now supports PyTorch + Hugging Face.

If scaled at Panther Creek:

Revenue boost → $6–8M/MW (thanks to AMD’s pricing + cheap power).

Quebec tests already yield 2–3x mining margins.

4. Talent &amp; Partners Lining Up

James Bond (yes, real name) hired as SVP of HPC on Mar 26, 2025 → likely behind the Quebec AI pilot.

T5 Data Centers provides lifecycle ops, certifications, and multi-year contracts → exactly the type of partner hyperscalers demand.

Locations = edge:

Pennsylvania: Cheap/stable nuclear, undersea fiber routes to EU/Africa, political support for data centers.

Washington: Hydro &lt; $0.03/kWh, West Coast hub with fiber routes to Asia.

5. The Big Picture

Bitfarms is quietly building an AWS-style AI/GovCloud pivot → with nuclear-backed capacity, AMD MI300X pilots, and GovCloud talent.

If certifications + hyperscaler deal land (Amazon is the obvious candidate), Panther Creek could turn into one of the highest-margin AI data centers in North America.

Bitcoin mining may become the “side hustle”; AI cloud could be the real money printer.


TLDR:

Wayne Duso (ex-AWS GovCloud) joins Bitfarms → signaling FedRAMP/DoD ambitions.

Panther Creek (PA) could net $5–7M/MW/year, scaling to multi-B revenue.

Quebec pilot proves AMD MI300X racks = cheaper, more efficient vs. NVIDIA.

Talent + partners (James Bond, T5 Data Centers) strengthen the case.

Locations in PA + WA give Bitfarms strategic energy + fiber advantages.

Speculation but very plausible: Bitfarms is morphing from BTC miner → AI cloud Gov/DoD player.",247,108,1759191131.0,2025-09-30T00:12:11+00:00,t3_1ntyifa,wallstreetbets

I think $APLD deserves a proper DD. Stock has gone absolutely nuts this year and rightfully so.

# Price Action:

Back in April this thing was around $3.  
Fast forward to now and it’s sitting near $20. That’s not just meme momentum it’s tied to monster contracts and a legit buildout story.

Notable mention:

Q4 2025 earnings call the CEO Wes Cummins confirmed that the company is in ""advanced negotiations"" with a major North American hyperscaler. (So we can assume other big contracts will be announced soon?)

# The Big Contracts:

CoreWeave (which is also backed by NVIDIA just like APLD), one of the hottest AI infra names, signed two 15-year leases worth about $7B in revenue.  
Then they exercised another 150 MW lease, bringing their total with APLD to 400 MW and raising the backlog to roughly $11B.  
This is locked-in, multi-year recurring revenue once facilities go live.

# Roadmap / Buildout (as mentioned on their official site):

480+ MW constructed in the last 18 months shows they can scale fast.  
400 MW currently under construction at Polaris Forge 1 in Ellendale, ND. First 100 MW goes live in Q4 2025, another 150 MW mid-2026, final 150 MW in 2027.  
1.4+ GW future pipeline already scoped out, backed by financing from Macquarie.  
Super efficient designs, direct chip cooling in collab with DELL, ND climate, PUE +-1.18, keep costs low versus their competitors.

# Energy contracts:

Secured 200 MW renewable power in Texas via TerraForm Power (Brookfield) to supply their Garden City site.  
For Polaris Forge 2 in ND, they already locked in power through Cass County Electric and Minnkota Power.  
These deals mean cheap, reliable energy the lifeblood of AI/HPC data centers. Without it, the contracts wouldn’t even be possible.

**TL:DR**

$3 in April to +-$24 now.  
$11B+ lease backlog with CoreWeave.  
480 MW built, 400 MW under construction, 1.4 GW pipeline.  
Energy supply already secured in TX and ND.  
Backed by Macquarie financing and designed for efficiency.

5,DELL,"""Bad"" stocks get a strong bounce back !","Hey everyone

  
During the last earning session where We watched the earning for Q2 and S1 2025, some very watched stocks got ""bad earning"". I can give three examples :

\- Coreweave : missed earning and a bigger debt ...

\- Innodata : missed earning and maybe they will not satisfy their promesse of hyper growth.

\- TSSI : missed earning, and slow the growth cause of lack of means. Moreover, Dell, their main partner, is not in a ""good situation""

  
I guess investor has just forgotten this moment because today : 

\- Coreweave has got 33% in few days since the bounce back.

\- Innodata got 59% in the same period (Since 4 september)

\- TSSI has gone up 30% ...

  
It's just crazy how the US stockmarket can offer this kind of script. I've never seen the market goes back so quick and strong to ""bad"" stocks. Usually, the market let the stock dying upto the next earning. The best example is Arista Network : very good earning but not enough for the market in January. The stock dropped slowly ... upto summer earning where the earning were very very good.

10,DELL,Micron ($MU) - Fundamentals win over the hype,"Too Long; Didn’t Read: **Micron ($MU)** is the only U.S. producer of **HBM3e** \- critical for AI data centers, plus world-first PCIe Gen6 SSDs and space-qualified memory.

* Forward P/E \~10 vs 20–30+ for other AI names. 2025 EPS \~$8.06 -&gt; fair value $180-240, with upside to $300+ in 2026 if growth holds.
* **Performance**: +55% YTD, +21% last month - beating most “AI darlings” quietly, without hype.
* **Risk/Reward**: Near-term pullbacks possible before earnings (in \~3 weeks), but long-term rerating is logical.
* **Conclusion**: MU doesn’t need hype. Real products, real sales, real demand - the undervalued backbone of AI infrastructure.

Despite September being unusually active compared to historical averages, **MU posted the strongest growth among large AI infrastructure players over the past month (and earnings are in 3 weeks from now -** *September 23, 2025 at 4 PM EDT*\*\*)\*\*.

And it did so without hype:

* no flashy headlines,
* no meme communities,
* no antitrust court victories,
* with flows still influenced by ETF rebalancing and institutional positioning.

# Why does the market still underestimate MU?

* The “RAM is cyclical” narrative still lingers, even among seasoned investors.
* Many still anchor MU to a short-cycle, commoditized trade, despite structural AI demand extending memory cycles.
* Meanwhile, earnings are exploding, and the DRAM/HBM cycle is becoming longer and indispensable.

# The AI Backbone

* Data centers and AI cannot exist without memory.
* MU is the only U.S. producer of HBM3e, delivering the highest quality modules - a critical material for AI data centers.
* Samsung makes DRAM too, but in its flagship Galaxy S25 phones it relies on… Micron memory.
* Micron also unveiled a portfolio of new AI-focused SSDs for data centers:

\- 9650 SSD - world’s first PCIe Gen6 drive, ultra-fast (28 GB/s read, 14 GB/s write), optimized for AI workloads.

\- 6600 ION SSD - up to 245 TB capacity, ultra-efficient, perfect for AI hyperscalers.

# What’s changing?

* Coverage in the press is clearly improving.
* Analysts and ETFs, who this year pumped PLTR and other meme stories, are now late to recognize MU.
* MU is starting to be seen for what it truly is: the backbone of AI.
* And importantly, MU is **capturing more market share** in HBM and advanced memory -securing new customers and ramping capacity in 2025.

# The Numbers

* Forward P/E \~9-11 - far below most AI names.
* EPS approaching \~$12, gross margin \~42%.
* Market conviction is rising: the memory cycle is lasting longer and has become critical for AI and data centers.

# Why did others get the hype first?

* Media, ETFs, and analysts this year inflated PLTR during the AI hype mania.
* MU was recognized only later - undervalued, low-key, but with real products and clear technological advantages.
* Government contracts are a natural fit - radiation-tolerant memory is exactly what defense and space agencies need.

# Outlook

* Short-term pullbacks possible (profit-taking, earnings expectations).
* But long-term re-rating looks inevitable

**Valuation outlook (based on 2026 EPS forecast \~12 USD)**

P/E 15 -&gt; 12 × 15 = **$180**

P/E 20 -&gt; 12 × 20 = **$240**

P/E 25 -&gt;12 × 25 = **$300**

* For now: **real products, real sales, real markets** \- unlike hype-driven fantasies.

# Advantages

* **Only U.S. producer of HBM3e** \- strategic supplier for NVIDIA H200 and future AI accelerators.
* **AI-optimized SSD portfolio** \- world’s first PCIe Gen6 SSD (9650) and massive 245TB ION SSD for hyperscalers.
* **Radiation-tolerant memory** \- first space-qualified NAND/DRAM portfolio, certified for NASA and defense.
* **Adopted by competitors** \- Samsung uses Micron memory in its Galaxy S25 flagship phones.
* **Diversified portfolio** \- DRAM, NAND, NOR, HBM, and space-grade memory all under one roof.
* **U.S. fabs** \- Boise (Idaho) and New York expansions give Micron a secure domestic supply chain edge.
* **SK hynix currently leads in HBM** market share, and Samsung is pushing capacity – **but** Micron is rapidly gaining share and remains the only U.S.-based HBM supplier. This gives MU a strategic edge, especially with U.S. fabs reducing 100% exposure to potential tariff shocks.
* Micron isn’t just gaining share in HBM - it’s also expanding capacity with **strong U.S. government backing**. In 2025, Micron announced \~$150B in domestic memory manufacturing investments and $50B in R&amp;D, supported by the Trump administration. This reduces dependency on Asia and strengthens MU’s position as the only U.S.-based HBM supplier.

**How does Micron stack up against its rivals?**  
Here’s how MU compares with SK hynix and Samsung - and where its unique edge comes from:

# Competition &amp; Edge

* **Where rivals lead** **SK hynix currently leads in HBM**, with Samsung rapidly scaling capacity for next-gen parts. Both remain key suppliers to NVIDIA today.
* **Where Micron is catching up** but Micron is rapidly adding HBM customers and aims to lift share through 2025 -TrendForce reports Micron has secured four major GPU/ASIC clients and is targeting \~24% DRAM share by year-end, from a lower base.
* **Only U.S.-based HBM supplier** That unique footprint matters for AI data centers and government buyers. Micron’s HBM3e has been in volume production for NVIDIA’s H200 since 2024, with 8-high shipping and 12-high sampling at &gt;9.2 Gbps pin speed.
* **Storage edge for AI** Micron isn’t just DRAM/HBM - it’s pushing the I/O bottleneck: the **9650** is the first **PCIe Gen6** data-center SSD (up to \~28 GB/s), while **6600 ION** lines up ultra-high capacity to **122 TB now** and **245 TB** on the roadmap. That combo pairs well with AI training/inference pipelines.
* **U.S. fabs and policy tailwind** In 2025 Micron announced an expanded **$200B U.S. investment plan** ($150B manufacturing + $50B R&amp;D) in coordination with the administration - new capacity in Idaho and New York and advanced HBM packaging reduce single-region exposure and help mitigate tariff/geo shocks.
* **Tech roadmap nuance** Rivals are shifting HBM base-die production to foundry flows starting with HBM4 to address thermals and power. Reports say Micron may keep DRAM-process base dies through HBM4 and move with HBM4e - a watch-item that could influence competitive positioning.

**Bottom line:** **SK hynix leads today**, Samsung is scaling, but Micron’s U.S. base, accelerating HBM customer wins, and AI-focused SSD lineup give it a differentiated edge heading into 2025-26 - with policy-backed capacity expanding at home.

# Risks

* China retaliation - Beijing already restricted Micron products in critical infrastructure (2023); more tariffs or bans could cut into demand.
* Trade tariffs / Trump policies - new tariffs on materials and equipment from Asia could increase production costs, even if they also weaken Samsung/SK hynix in the U.S. market.
* Geopolitical exposure - escalation around Taiwan or Korea could disrupt supply chains globally, affecting MU’s inputs and logistics.
* Perception of a short-cycle commodity - despite structural AI demand, many investors and ETFs still treat memory as if it were a quick-turn, commoditized trade.
* Hyperscaler concentration - sales heavily tied to a handful of customers (NVIDIA, Amazon, Microsoft, Google). Any slowdown in hyperscaler CapEx would hit MU directly. This risk is not unique to Micron, but concentration makes revenue swings more visible

# The conclusion

Micron doesn’t need hype.  
It’s a fundamentally strong company, undervalued relative to EPS growth and forward guidance.  
Yes, there will be corrections and dips along the way. But the road to **$200\* and beyond** remains.  
\* *(Based on 2025 avg. EPS estimate of $8.06 x P/E multiple of 25 = $202 fair value target.)*

Micron is the **quiet but solid leader of AI infrastructure**. No memes, no empty headlines - just real products, rising demand, and technological edge, from data centers all the way to outer space.

**Year-to-date growth comparison (as of Sept 2025)**

|Company|YTD (%)|Comment|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**MU**|**+55%**|Fundamentals, AI SSDs, HBM3e, space-grade memory|
|**PLTR**|**+101%**|Hype, meme-driven, weak EPS|

6,DELL,"SCHWAB: Stocks Fall, Yields &amp; VIX Soar After Tariff Ruling
09:26am EDT, 09/02/2025","**(Tuesday market open)** Treasury yields and volatility spiked while tech stocks slumped to start the short week after a court decision ruled most of President Trump's tariffs illegal. The tariffs remain in place on appeal, but the news has markets on edge, judging by global yield climbs. Seasonal trends also came into play, with September traditionally Wall Street's worst month and a strong earnings season virtually over.

**Salesforce** (CRM) and **Broadcom** (AVGO) earnings tomorrow and Thursday keep tech in view as the sector appeared to stumble. Broadcom might shed more light on AI demand after results from **Dell** (DELL) and **Marvell** (MRVL) last week triggered anxiety. Industry leader Nvidia (NVDA) fell more than 3% Friday and is down again this morning, hurt partly by those two earnings reports and by a *Wall Street Journal* article about a new AI chip developed by Chinese firm **Alibaba** (BABA). Some of today's shakiness also could reflect trepidation approaching Friday's August **nonfarm payrolls** report. Analysts expect more weakness with just 78,000 jobs added. Data today include a look at U.S. manufacturing health.

Major indexes retreated from recent record highs last Friday as **Personal Consumption Expenditures** (PCE) price data reinforced ideas that inflation remains sticky. Odds of a rate cut this month remain above 90%, according to the **CME FedWatch Tool**. ""We expect the Fed to cut twice this year,"" said Cooper Howard, director, fixed income strategy at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. Risk-off trading dominated late last week with energy, consumer staples, and health care among the leaders and info tech and consumer discretionary weaker. Still, August was the fourth straight positive month for the **S&amp;P 500 index**, which rose 1.91%. The Nasdaq added 1.58%.

**Three things to watch**

**Software earnings hint at rebound with Salesforce ahead:** Investors will closely watch a slate of software companies set to report earnings this week after better-than-expected results from **Snowflake** (SNOW) and other industry firms last week defied a broader slump in the sector. Snowflake and **MongoDB** (MDB) both spiked after reporting solid revenue growth. **MongoDB** said it's added more than 5,000 customers year to date, a record amid growing demand from large firms building AI applications. Results clashed with a trend of underperformance in the software sector. Shares of giants like **Salesforce** (CRM) and **Adobe** (ADBE) have dropped significantly in 2025, even with the **Nasdaq Composite** up more than 10%. Shares of giants like **Salesforce** (CRM) and **Adobe** (ADBE) have dropped significantly in 2025, even with the **Nasdaq Composite** up more than 10%. This week, investors get more insight from software leaders, headlined by **Salesforce** on Wednesday. **Broadcom** (AVGO), which derives nearly half its revenue from software sales, will report Thursday.

Congress back in town with a deadline: Senators and representatives return to Washington today following a summer break. The top priority will be government funding, which expires September 30. Legislators will need to pass the 12 appropriations bills that fund every government agency and program by then. ""Congress is no where near doing that, and that means there is a risk of a government shutdown at the end of September,” said Michael Townsend, managing director of legislative and regulatory affairs at Schwab. ""Historically, government shutdowns have not been big market movers, in fact, the market has gone up in the last five government shutdowns. But it would add yet another element of uncertainty that markets will have to consider."" Under a nearer-term Washington microscope: This week's **Senate Banking Committee** confirmation hearing for Stephen Miran, Trump's nominee to fill a Fed vacancy. This could bring more drama than usual after Trump attempted for fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook last week, raising concerns about Fed independence.

**Positive trend persists despite today's weakness: Technically**, markets held up relatively well last week and the momentum-signaling **Relative Strength Index (RSI)** for the **S&amp;P 500 index** finished Friday above 58, a constructive reading, though down a bit from the August peak near 68. Breadth remained constructive last week, as well, but volatility as measured by the **Cboe Volatility Index** (VIX) spiked today, interrupting what had been a subdued hedging environment. So-called ""risk-on"" sectors led in August with strong showings from communication services, materials, financials, and consumer discretionary stocks. Info tech had a mild month, rising less than 0.3%. And the **S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Index** (SPXEW), which weighs all stocks the same rather than by market capitalization, outpaced the **S&amp;P 500 index** for the first time in four months, a sign of broader strength beyond the mega caps.

**On the move**

* Tech leaders **Nvidia** (NVDA) and **Palantir** (PLTR) fell early Tuesday amid a general pullback in risk-on trading that appeared to spill over from Friday. Nvidia tumbled 2.4% and is now down nearly 8% from recent all-time highs recorded before last week's earnings report, which came in generally as expected but didn't set off any fireworks. Palantir fell 3.5% this morning and is down almost 18% from last month's peak.  
* **Bitcoin futures** (/BTC) dropped nearly 4% Friday and ended August down 7.6% for the month despite hitting an all-time high on August 14. Futures rebounded slightly early today. **Coinbase** (COIN) both dropped 1% Friday but **Circle Internet Group** (CRCL) managed a light gain.  
* **Signet Jewelers** (SIG) shares shined today, up 3.4% as investors reacted to solid earnings. The company also raised earnings guidance for the fiscal year.  
* **Meta Platforms** (META) fell 1.7% after Reuters reported the company removed several celebrity AI chatbots after using celebrity voices and images without permission.  
* **Block** (XYZ) fell 3.1% as BNP Paribas downgraded shares to Hold from Buy.  
* **Tesla** (TSLA) fell 2% ahead of the open after a 4% drop in August sales in China, Reuters reported.  
* **PepsiCo** (PEP) popped nearly 5% today as the *Wall Street Journal* reported that activist investor Elliott Investment Management has built a roughly $4 billion stake in the company.  
* **Newmont** (NMT) climbed 1% early Tuesday, helped by global uncertainty and rate cut hopes that continue to support gold prices.  
* **Crude oil** rose 2.3% early Tuesday amid increased concerns around the war in Ukraine and ahead of this coming weekend's OPEC meeting. Analysts expect no production changes from the meeting, CNBC reported.  
* **Marvell Technology** plunged double digits Friday and another 2.6% today after second quarter data center revenue rose 69% but missed analysts' consensus. Earnings per share and revenue were in line with expectations, and guidance also was near consensus views. Shares had already fallen 30% this year before the latest drop.  
* **Dell Technologies** dropped nearly 9% Friday despite quarterly results that topped Wall Street's estimates and reflected strong growth in its AI server business. It also raised its full-year outlook. But guidance for third quarter earnings per share fell short of consensus.  
* The **Russell 2000\*\*\*\*****^(®)** **Index** (RUT) of smaller stocks outpaced other major indexes with a nearly 7% rise in August as rate cut odds supported a move into smaller names.

7,DELL,NVDA | NVIDIA Last 5 Years + Next 5 Years,"NVIDIA CEO Jen-Hsun Huang lays it out clearly in his conference call remarks. Based on his comments, I expect the company to generate 40% to 50% revenue growth for the next few years. Beyond GPU and Networking Silicon, in the future, I believe NVIDIA will enter A.I. software infrastructure services, offering full system and application support for the largest compute customers in the world, both CSP and Enterprise, as well as Sovereign investors.\* (see below)

I am long NVDA and AMD.

**Key Nuggets from CEO in Last 3 Conference Calls:**

**FQ4 2025 (Feb. 26, 2025):**

""There are now multiple scaling laws. There is the **pre-training scaling law**, and that is going to continue to scale because we have multimodality, we have data that came from reasoning that are now used to do pretraining. And then the second is **post-training scaling law**, using reinforcement learning human feedback, reinforcement learning AI feedback, reinforcement learning, verifiable rewards. The amount of computation you use for post training is actually higher than pretraining. And it is kind of sensible in the sense that you could, while you are using reinforcement learning, generate an enormous amount of synthetic data or synthetically generated tokens. AI models are basically generating tokens to train AI models. And that's post training. And the third part, this is the part that you mentioned is **test time computation or reasoning, long thinking, inference scaling**. They are all basically the same ideas. And there you have a chain of thought, you have searched. The amount of tokens generated and the amount of inference compute needed is already 100x more than the one-shot examples and the one-shot capabilities of large language models in the beginning. And that is just the beginning. This is just the beginning. The idea that the next generation could have thousands of times and even hopefully, extremely thoughtful and simulation-based and search-based models that could be hundreds of thousands, millions of times more compute than today is in our future.""

**FQ1 2026 (May 28, 2025):**

**""Grace Blackwell NVLink72 is the ideal engine today, the ideal computer thinking machine, if you will, for reasoning AI. There's a couple of reasons for that. The first reason is that the token generation amount, the number of tokens reasoning goes through, is 100 times, 1,000 times more than a one-shot chatbot. It's essentially thinking to itself, breaking down a problem step-by-step. It might be planning multiple paths to an answer. It could be using tools, reading PDFs, reading web pages, watching videos, and then producing a result, an answer. The longer it thinks,** **the better the answer**, **the smarter the answer is**. And so, what we would like to do, and the reason why Grace Blackwell was designed to give such a giant step-up in inference performance, is so that you could do all this and still get a response as quickly as possible. **Compared to Hopper, Grace Blackwell is some 40 times higher speed and throughput compared.** And so, this is going to be a huge, huge benefit in driving down the cost while improving the quality of response with excellent quality of service at the same time. So, that's the fundamental reason. That was the core driving reason for Grace Blackwell NVLink72. Of course, in order to do that, we had to reinvent, literally redesign the entire way that these supercomputers are built, and -- but now we're in full production. It's going to be exciting. It's going to be incredibly exciting.""

**FQ2 2025 (August 27, 2025):**

""And so we are really an AI infrastructure company, and we are hoping to continue to contribute to growing this industry, making AI more useful and then very importantly, driving the performance per watt because the world, as you mentioned, limiters, it will always likely be power limitations or AI -- building limitations. And so we need to squeeze as much out of that factory as possible. **NVIDIA's performance per unit of energy used drives the revenue growth of that factory.** It directly translates. If you have a 100- megawatt factory, performance per 100 megawatt drives your revenues. It is tokens per 100 megawatts of factory. In our case also, the performance per dollar spent is so high that your gross margins are also the best. But anyhow, these are the limiters going forward and $3 trillion to $4 trillion is fairly sensible for the next 5 years.""

8,DELL,"Nvidia’s top 2 mystery customers made 39% of Q2 revenue, up from 25% last year, raising concentration risk concerns","No paywall: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/28/nvidias-top-two-mystery-customers-made-up-39percent-of-its-q2-revenue-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/28/nvidias-top-two-mystery-customers-made-up-39percent-of-its-q2-revenue-.html)

Two Nvidia customers made up 39% of Nvidia’s revenue in its July quarter, the company revealed in a financial filing on Wednesday, raising concerns about the concentration of the chipmaker’s clientele.

“Customer A” made up 23% of total revenue, and “Customer B” comprised 16% of total revenue, according to the company’s second-quarter filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

That’s higher than the same quarter a year ago when Nvidia’s top two customers made up 14% and 11% of sales, according to the filing.

The company regularly publishes information on a quarterly basis about its top customers, but the disclosure this week is fueling a renewed debate about whether Nvidia’s explosive growth is being driven by a handful of large cloud providers such as Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Oracle.

Nvidia finance chief Colette Kress said in a Wednesday statement that “large cloud service providers” made up about 50% of the company’s data center revenue. That’s important as the data center business made up 88% of Nvidia’s overall revenue in the second quarter.

“We have experienced periods where we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers, and this trend may continue,” Nvidia wrote in the filing.

Increasingly, analysts are looking to those cloud capital expenditure spending commitments to model the future growth of Nvidia.

“We see limited room for further earnings upside revision or share price catalyst in the near-term unless we have increasing clarity over upside in 2026 \[cloud service provider\] capex expectations,” wrote HSBC analyst Frank Lee in a note on Thursday. He has a hold rating on the stock.

But Nvidia’s Customer A and Customer B are not necessarily cloud providers. It’s a bit of a mystery, and an Nvidia representative declined to share the identities of Customer A and Customer B.

In its filing, Nvidia says it has both “direct customers” and “indirect customers.” Customer A and Customer B are listed as “direct customers.”

Direct customers are not the end users of Nvidia’s chips. They’re companies that buy the chips to build into complete systems or circuit boards that they then sell to data centers, cloud providers and end-users. Some of these direct customers are original design manufacturers or original equipment manufacturers like Foxconn or Quanta. Others are distributors or system integrators like Dell.

Indirect customers, meanwhile, include cloud service providers, internet companies and enterprises, which typically buy systems from Nvidia’s direct customers. Nvidia says it can only estimate revenue to indirect customers based on purchase orders and internal sales data.

Deciphering if any of those cloud providers are Nvidia’s mystery customers is difficult, in part because the chipmaker has wiggle room in the definitions of its direct and indirect customers.

Nvidia, for example, wrote in the filing that some direct customers buy chips to build systems for their own use.

Additionally, Nvidia noted that two of its indirect customers each accounted for over 10% of its total revenue, primarily buying systems through Customers A and B.

Contributing further to the mystery of it all, Nvidia said that an “AI research and development company” contributed a “meaningful” amount of revenue through both direct and indirect customers.

Nvidia told investors on Wednesday that demand for the company’s AI systems remains high, not just among cloud providers, but among other kinds of customers, including enterprises buying systems for AI and “neoclouds,” which are companies that are taking on the biggest providers with services more tuned for AI. Nvidia also listed foreign governments, saying it would record $20 billion in revenue this year for “sovereign AI.” All of these product categories are contributing to Nvidia’s revenue growth, Kress told analysts on an earnings call.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang also said that the company has a new forecast of $3 to $4 trillion in AI infrastructure by the end of the decade. It said that it could take about 70% of the total cost of a $50 billion AI-focused data center, not just for its graphics processing units but for other chips it sells, too.

Huang told investors it was a sensible target for the next five years because of how much hyperscalers were spending and committing to spend — $600 billion this year, according to Huang. He also said new kinds of customers, such as enterprises or overseas cloud providers, were joining the build-out.

“As you know, the capex of just the top four hyperscalers has doubled in two years as the AI revolution went into full steam,” Huang said.",1627,258,1756652296.0,2025-08-31T14:58:16+00:00,t3_1n4wvy8,wallstreetbets

2,DELL,Laptop recommendation for trading,"Folks,

I'm in dire need of a new laptop for trading. The one I have is ancient. I'm with IB. TWS technically works, but it's not very responsive; stands to reason. I'm looking for recommendations from other IB traders to identify a laptop on which TWS runs and responds quickly.

  
This laptop is a Dell and has served me well, but it's tired. I've also owned an Asus laptop and was happy with its performance. It doesn't need to be a top-of-the-line gaming machine, obviously. That said, I'd like it to have at least 32GB of RAM, SSD (1TB is ample), and a powerful GPU (Nvidia or Radeon, etc). Also, backlit keyboard (once you've used one you'll wonder how you ever got along without one).

10,DELL,Super Micro (SMCI) plunges 17% AH after Q4 miss; FY26 outlook strong at $33B vs $29.9B est,"No paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/super-micros-quarterly-revenue-misses-201116203.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/super-micros-quarterly-revenue-misses-201116203.html)

(Reuters) -Super Micro missed Wall Street estimates for fourth-quarter revenue and profit on Tuesday, as the company battles larger server makers for high-performance computers used to train artificial-intelligence models.

Shares of the San Jose, California-based firm slumped 15% in extended trading. They have soared 91% this year, as investors bet on strong demand for its AI servers and its liquid cooling solutions.

Super Micro has been gaining traction in the hyper-competitive server industry, but analysts have said larger rivals such as Dell Technologies and HP Enterprise have been able to leverage their vast customer base to boost sales.

""Since we know the market for servers is very strong right now, it is safe to assume the disappointing results for Super Micro are due to share losses,"" said Gil Luria, managing director at D.A. Davidson &amp; Co.

""Their customers are very discerning right now and are choosing servers from Dell, HP and others,"" Luria added.

Super Micro expects revenue of at least $33 billion for fiscal year 2026, compared to analysts' average estimate of $29.94 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.

The company, which is bouncing back from accounting-related issues, said revenue for the three months ended June 30 was $5.76 billion, compared with analysts' average estimate of $5.89 billion.

Its adjusted earnings of 41 cents per share fell short of estimates of 44 cents.",276,100,1754430449.0,2025-08-05T21:47:29+00:00,t3_1mimfx8,wallstreetbets

51,DELL,Meta Capex and Opex will shake Wallstreet to the core.,"(post translate and enhanced with AI) 

The AI fever continues driving the market to record highs.

After blowing through $60 billion on the Metaverse, Zuckerberg is now racing to lead the charge for super intelligence and infinite gains.

While I'm somewhat skeptical about this strategy of hiring a bunch of rockstar researchers who have never worked together and expecting them to perform miracles, we all have to admire Zuck's boldness.

But my point here is about whether Wall Street truly understands the magnitude of spending that Meta is committing to, and how this will affect financial results in the coming months and years.

I can't think of any similar example other than Meta itself between 2019 and 2022 with the Metaverse. And even this seems to be an order of magnitude larger.

Perhaps a similar positive example would be Microsoft's pivot to the Cloud in 2012. But in that situation, there was only one major competitor (AWS).

To wrap up: I expect that tomorrow we'll see much stronger movements in companies like Nvidia, AMD, Dell, IBM on the upside and Google and Oracle on the downside.

- **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (standard deviation of daily log returns) of the underlying asset and compare that to the current implied volatility (IV) of the option price. We use the same DTE as a look back period. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium associated with the pricing of options (implied volatility).
    
- **Directional Bias:** Ranges from negative (bearish) to positive (bullish) and accounts for RSI, price trend, moving averages, and put/call skew over the past 6 weeks.

- **Priced Move:** given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move.

- **Expiration:** 2025-08-01.

- **Call/Put Premium:** How much extra you are paying for the implied move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean options are ""cheaper."" High numbers mean options are ""expensive.""

- **Efficiency:** This factor represents the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price of the option. It represents how much traders will pay in slippage with a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.

- **E.R.:** Days unitl the next Earnings Release. This feature is still in beta as we work on a more complete list of earnings dates.

- **Why isn't my stock on this list?** It doesn't have ""weeklies"", the underlying is ""too cheap"", or the options markets are too illiquid (open interest) to qualify for this strategy. 480 underlyings are used in this report and only the top results end up passing the criteria for each filter.",17,1,1753711515.0,2025-07-28T14:05:15+00:00,t3_1mbh3fx,options

12,DELL,"Life is finite. Risk aversion. (Once bitten, Twice shy.)","Some day I will die. I do not know when, but I know I will not live forever.

Every dollar I make in salary at my workplace represents a minute, hour, day, or some other unit of time I will NEVER get back. It represents time I'm not spending with family and time I'm not out enjoying myself.

Watching that money disappear is like shaving years off my life. Hell, I'd say burning it may even be more productive since some people at least get some form of enjoyment out of smoking cigarettes...

Now obviously, I need that money to afford food and whatnot, so I can't go quitting my job. But I do not spend frivolously on luxury goods. I live in a modest house in the suburbs and drive a 20 yr old, 4 cylinder Japanese compact hatchback.

\--------------------

Late in 1999, I was given a $3k High School graduation present. Opened an eTrade account and bought a bunch tech stocks (Microsoft, Dell, IBM, Cisco, Juniper, etc) Made a couple thousand more in under a year. Figured I couldn't lose, as I had a background in tech. As an engineering student, I knew the industry. Or at least I thought I did.

By the early 2000s, my portfolio was worth three digits.

Before I pulled the plug and sold all my stocks, I was literally sitting on the computer the entirety of 2002, 2003, and 2004 hitting Refresh and watching my portfolio lose value.

I had some startup companies that were promising that ended up going under and their stock values ended up being ZERO.

I did not, and still to this day do not know where the money went. It just disappeared.

People tell me I sold in the dip when I should have bought more. I was in high school/college. I was working low end jobs and needed the money. I had no money to invest.

Few years later, I got grandmothers inheritance to the tune of $30k in 2005. Bought a house for cash in the boonies and put another $10k in my own savings into it (paint, carpet, trim work, etc.) Sold the house for $65k three months later.

Wanted a bachelor pad, so I bought another small house,  closer to where I wanted to live on an ARM in 2006 and was upside down, two years later... $240k mortgage at 5% going up to 7% in three years on a house that appraised for $125k.

BUT at least I had a roof over my head. I still own that house and it's now a rental property.

I buy houses that I can flip/rent. They're tangible and I can control what work goes into them. If I want to make a house increase in value, I can renovate it. And an house will NEVER be worth NOTHING. Even if it burns down to the ground, the vacant land will have value. Insurance also covers losses on a house. Can't insure stocks.

I am VERY risk adverse, having been bitten before.

I can not control the value of a stock. I have zero influence if a company will release a gadget that will catch on and be the next big thing or if it will flop.

I can't subtly count cards, so I don't set foot in casinos.

I'm of the mindset that to invest in stocks, you need to have money that you're not afraid of losing.

How can I get out of this mindset so that I can YOLO all my savings on whatever wallstreetbets is peddling this week? People make bank day trading. I want to know their secret.",0,64,1750072352.0,2025-06-16T11:12:32+00:00,t3_1lcq2bc,investing

4,DELL,High probability results play,"Want to know your thoughts on this results play for stocks with high IV (100+)

There are 3 assumptions:

**Assumption A**: After earnings, stocks do one of - move very little (causing huge IV crush) / go up / go down. These are the high probability cases.

**Assumption B:**. PEAD (Post Earnings Announcement Drift) Stocks that go up after results keep going up for some more time (and vice versa)

**Assumption C:** After results, stocks going up and then down or going down and then up are low probability cases.

**Play**

Buy an ATM CALL calendar spread and PUT calendar spread.

1. If stock doesnt move much (2-3%) both legs experience IV crush and turn into profit
2. If results are very good, put will go to 0 immediately. The short call will go up a lot but the long call will also go up. Continue to hold the long call into the following week as the stock can continue rising and the net position will turn into a profit. Basically if the stock continues its uptrend by PEAD, the gains from the long leg will more than offset the loss from the short leg.
3. Opposite case for put spread.
4. In the low probability scenario C, both legs will turn into profit as the stock reverts to the original strike price. This is an IV crush scenario
5. **Assignment risk is high for the short leg in correct direction**. So make sure you have enough funds to handle it. Hold the stocks till the Friday expiry time and sell around Friday mkt close. This is equivalent to closing the short leg (correct me on this.)

I tried this last few weeks for couple of stocks. I risked $200 each

* ANF - Stock exploded but then started coming down, due to this both legs gave 50% profit
* CRM, DELL, TGT, MRVL, NVDA - none of them moved as much as the IV predicted. 50% profit each
* S - I had assignment in this! I panicked and exercised my long puts too, so lost around 300 (150%). S dropped today also. So had I held onto the long leg it would have been net profit.
* SNOW - Snow shot up a lot but the uptrend continued. I continued to hold the long leg and had a net profit (200%)

The low probability cases in Assumption C can wreck this setup. I got some windows where I exited with profit. Holding them till Friday EOD could have been a loss. (CRM, DELL)

But the others seem to be working well. Is it hindsight bias. Please share your thoughts and any risks I am missing.

Above is sample scenario. OptionStrats model doesnt account for the IV crush and the max profit  assumption is incorrect. We can adjust that though. The thing of interest is the max loss guarantee is lost once you separate the legs. However, once you know the result outcome you can decide whether to continue holding the long leg or not

**Nvidia Earnings Highlight Slate of Tech, Retail, Financial Reports This Week**

Nvidia is scheduled to report its quarterly earnings on Wednesday. The chipmaking giant recently returned to the $3 trillion market-capitalization level after its share price rallied by around 50% from its April low. The earnings report follows the company’s announcement that it will supply semiconductors to Saudi Arabian AI startup Humain. Nvidia reported 78% year-over-year revenue growth in its prior earnings release. Semiconductor firm Marvell Technology is also scheduled to report this week.

Salesforce’s expected report on Wednesday comes after the cloud software provider reported 8% revenue growth in its prior quarter on the growth of its Agentforce custom AI platform. While the firm delivered a worse-than-expected outlook, analysts said the company had strong potential for growth.

Thursday’s scheduled report from Dell Technologies will show whether the computer maker continues to benefit from increased demand for AI infrastructure after it grew server and networking sales by 37% in the prior quarter. Morgan Stanley recently raised its price target for the company, citing growing server sales momentum on AI demand. Market watchers will also be following computer equipment maker HP’s scheduled report on Wednesday.

Costco Wholesale is on Thursday’s corporate calendar, coming as the membership-based retailer reported that its April sales rose by 7%, which analysts attributed partly to customers rushing purchases ahead of U.S. tariffs. Costco reported a 9% revenue growth in its prior quarter on increased revenue from higher membership fees.

AutoZone’s scheduled report on Tuesday follows an upgrade from Bank of America Securities as analysts argued that higher auto costs from U.S. tariffs could lead to more vehicle repairs by cost-conscious drivers. Dick’s Sporting Goods’ expected report on Wednesday follows its recent deal to acquire sporting goods retailer Foot Locker (FL).

Investors will be watching the scheduled Thursday report from Chinese EV Li Auto, which competes with Tesla (TSLA) sales in that nation. The Tuesday report from PDD Holdings comes as the parent of Chinese-based online retailer Temu faces pressure from U.S. tariffs.

Inflation, GDP, Fed Speakers in Focus

Friday’s scheduled release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index will show how the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation fared in April. A similar inflation reading showed that price increases cooled somewhat in April, and the Fed has said it is closely watching prices in the wake of Trump’s tariffs.

Wednesday’s expected release of the minutes of the May meeting of the FOMC will provide more insight into Fed officials’ deliberations over interest rates and the economy. Likewise, several Fed officials are scheduled to speak during the week, including Fed Gov. Waller, New York Fed President Williams, and San Francisco Fed President Daly.

Revisions to first-quarter GDP are expected on Thursday after the initial report last month showed that the economy shrank in the first three months of 2025.

The state of the consumer will also be in focus for investors, with reports on consumer confidence and consumer sentiment scheduled to be released this week. The reports come as recent surveys show that consumers’ moods have soured over concerns that tariffs will drive prices higher. Friday’s expected reports on the U.S. trade deficit, retail inventories, and wholesale inventories will provide more detail on how U.S. tariffs are affecting the economy. ",65,3,1748178984.0,2025-05-25T13:16:24+00:00,t3_1kv2as8,stocks

17,DELL,What a UAE Deal Might Mean For SMCI,"This has been a pretty eventful week for SMCI and the AI sector as a whole. the acquisition of a [$20 billion deal](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/saudis-datavolt-signs-20bn-deal-with-supermicro/) with DataVolt in Saudi Arabia and a 39% jump in share price off the strength of the news and overall AI sentiment improving is enough to make any degen hard as solid veiny diamonds. One thing this week that has especially caught my eye is UAE's plan to construct a [5GW AI Campus](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2025/05/uae-and-us-presidents-attend-unveiling-phase-1-new-5gw-ai-campus-abu), with the help of G42, that will house 5GW worth of data center racks and span **10 square miles**.

To put this into perspective, thats:

* 50k 100kW full-scale liquid-cooled racks
* 3.2 **million** Nvidia Blackwell (B100) chips
* More power than NYC and San Francisco **combined**
* Equivalent to powering **3-4 million** homes or running **50 million** gaming PCs at full power 24/7

As you can see, this is an insanely ambitious feat the UAE is trying to achieve. Nonetheless, I couldn't help but ask myself, of the roughly 50k racks the UAE plans to procure, how many of those racks will be SMCI? Furthermore, whatever amount of racks SMCI does provide, how much money does SMCI stand to make from the project? Most importantly, What does that mean for the share price?

First, we need to understand what DCBBS is, and how it actually benefits customers with large scale projects like the UAE AI Campus.

DCBBS stands for **Direct Connect Backplane Building Block Solutions**, and it’s SMCI's proprietary system architecture for building **full AI racks,** not just individual servers. This means when a customer selects which AI rack configuration they want, when it arrives at their door, it comes in a form [like this](https://trendspider.com/blog/dell-and-super-micro-power-musks-ai-ambitions/). In other words, customers are getting Kitchen-Aid refrigerators sent to their fucking door that contain 30-90 Nvidia Blackwell chips and liquid cooling systems within them. No more receiving your SMCI rack order in individual server pieces that you have to assemble on your own. This greatly increases the speed in which these new data centers can go live. In most cases, these racks can be installed and plugged in in **under a day.**

Additionally, this also helps to increase their margins over time.

Traditionally, SMCI sold servers as modular building blocks. things like:

* 1U and 2U server chassis
* Motherboards
* Power supplies
* GPU trays

Customers (like system integrators, VARs, or hyperscalers) would assemble these into racks themselves. That’s low-margin business, because you’re selling parts, not solutions. the DCBBS racks contain:

* CPU &amp; GPU servers (e.g., Nvidia Blackwell, AMD EPYC, Intel Gaudi)
* Total liquid cooling (cold plates, manifolds, chillers, etc.)
* Network switches
* Rack management software
* Power distribution units (PDUs)

Why does this new model increase margins? Because it is a shift SMCI is making, from selling modular pieces that must be assembled, to selling complete solutions that are pre-assembled and ready for use upon arrival. This gives SMCI increased pricing power and in turn, increased margins. Below is a comparison table to illustrate the logic:

|Old Model (Per Server)|Rack-Scale Model (Per Rack)|
|:-|:-|
|Sell parts separately|Sell the full system integration|
|$5K–$15K ASP/server|$250K–$2M ASP per rack|
|6–10% gross margin|**15–25%+ gross margin**|
|Low-value add|**Turnkey AI solution** = premium pricing|

Now lets go more in depth:

**1. Higher Average Selling Price (ASP) per Unit**

* Traditional air-cooled servers sell for **$10K–$50K** each.
* Liquid-cooled **DCBBS racks** (often 64–96 GPUs) sell for **$2–5 million per rack**.
* Even if gross margins stay in the 8–10% range, **gross profit per rack is 40×–80× higher** than per-server sales.

Higher ASP = greater dollar-margin per unit sold, allowing SMCI to increase overall margins even with a similar percentage.

**2. Bundled Value = Control Over Margin Levers**

With DCBBS, SMCI is not just selling a server, it’s delivering:

* 8–12 liquid-cooled GPU servers
* 2000+ liquid-cooled racks a month
* Integrated CDUs (coolant distribution units)
* Power delivery + networking
* Cabling, plumbing, and chassis integration
* Software/BIOS optimization

All of these are designed, manufactured, and **assembled in-house**, which means:

1. Vertical integration reduces dependency on low-margin commodity components
2. Custom bundles let SMCI charge more for value-added services
3. Standardization improves yield, reduces warranty risk, and shortens labor cycles

**3. Faster Time-to-Deployment = Premium Pricing Power**

SMCI can ship **fully integrated, plug-and-play racks in 3–4 weeks**, while others take 8–12 weeks+ with multiple vendors.

For hyperscalers and AI startups racing to bring GPU clusters online, this **speed translates into willingness to pay more**, or at least not negotiate down.

For example: A customer buying a $2.5M rack from SMCI may avoid:

* Extra $500k/month in AI cloud rental costs
* 3–4 month delay in deploying AI training models
* Facility delays in retrofitting for traditional HVAC-based servers

Below is a table below comparing liquid-cooled racks Time-to-Deployment between SMCI and its competitors:

|**Vendor**|**Liquid-Cooled Rack Output (Est.)**|**Time to Deployment**|**Notes**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**SMCI**|**\~2,000+ racks/month**|**3–4 weeks** (from factory)|DCBBS fully integrated, scalable, Blackwell-ready|
|**Dell**|*Unknown (not disclosed)*|\~6–10 weeks (unverified)|IR7000 liquid-cooled racks for hyperscalers, but no output figures released|
|**HPE**|*Limited modular deployments*|\~8–12 weeks (pods)|Offers liquid-cooled AI systems (e.g. Cray EX, Apollo), but mostly for supercomputing clients|
|**Lenovo**|*Unknown*|6+ weeks (via FIS programs)|Neptune liquid cooling, but most integration is not turnkey at SMCI pace|

This “time-value” premium enhances margin per contract.

**4. Liquid Cooling = Lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for Clients**

Clients benefit from:

* 30–50%+ reduction in power usage (no fans/blowers at server level)
* Higher rack density → fewer racks → less real estate
* Reduced HVAC burden → capex + opex savings

Because DCBBS racks are pre-validated and ready for 80–100+ kW loads, customers can safely go denser per rack — which:

* Makes SMCI’s per-rack offering more economically valuable
* Lets them preserve pricing vs. air-cooled OEMs like Lenovo, HPE, or Dell, who may cut prices to remain competitive

Higher value-to-customer means more pricing power = higher gross margin

**5. Operational Efficiency at Scale**

SMCI is building out:

* A 3 million square foot manufacturing campus in Silicon Valley and Malaysia
* A supply chain optimized for GPU pre-allocation, liquid cooling parts, and just-in-time rack assembly

This allows SMCI to:

* Mass produce racks with minimal retooling
* Reduce per-rack cost at high volume
* Use contract-based repeat orders (like the DataVolt $20B deal) to plan capacity

Economies of scale + predictable assembly processes = declining cost/unit → rising margin

Below is a comparison table illustrating the margin impact:

|**Advantage**|**Margin Impact**|
|:-|:-|
|High ASP per rack|Higher gross profit in dollar terms|
|Bundled hardware/services|Increases perceived value + vertical profit|
|Speed to deploy (3-4 weeks)|Pricing premium vs. slower OEMs|
|Energy/cooling savings for customer|Improves TCO → preserves SMCI pricing power|
|Factory integration at scale|Lowers per-rack cost with volume|

So far, we've learned how DCBBS can substantially decrease build times for customers and how it could potentially increase margins for SMCI.

Now to the fun part: The UAE Deal

After doing some ape fisted carpet eating math, I estimate that the total cost of the 5GW AI Campus would be about $125 billion (assuming **each rack** draws about 100kW and sells for $2.5 million). Based on these numbers, I had ChatGPT build a table with a break down of what SMCI would get based on various percentages of the project they would be responsible for and superimposed a likelihood of occurrence formula in there:

|Coverage %|Likelihood of Occurrence|Racks Provided|G42 Total Payment to SMCI|Estimated Gross Profit (USD) 9.7%|Estimated EBITDA (USD)|Estimated EPS|Implied Share Price (@20x PE)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1%|Highly Likely (90%)|500|$1,250,000,000|$121,250,000|$103,062,500|$1.87|$37.40|

As you can see, even with a conservative PE of 20x and 9.7% margins, if SMCI gets even 2-5% of the project, thats an EPS of $3.75-9.37 and a share price of $75-187 a share.

**How ChatGPT Calculated the Likelihoods**

This wasn’t a statistical model but rather a strategic probability estimate based on 5 weighted factors:

**1. Historical Precedent (30%)**

* No hyperscaler or government has ever given 100% of a 5GW AI deployment to one vendor.
* Datavolt gave SMCI a $20B deal, but likely part of a larger multi-phase build — suggesting up to 25% is plausible.

**2. Industry Norm for Diversification (25%)**

* Large clients (e.g. AWS, G42, Meta) **split procurement across 2–4 OEMs** for risk mitigation, price leverage, and geopolitical hedging.
* Most national-scale AI campuses split rack-scale work among **Dell, Lenovo, HPE, SMCI, Nvidia integrators**, etc.

**3. SMCI Production Capacity (20%)**

* SMCI can output \~5,000 racks/month total, **2,000+ liquid cooled**.
* To hit 50–100% coverage of a 5GW facility, they’d need to commit 6–12 months of global capacity, which limits probability unless it's multi-year.

**4. Geopolitical Alignment (15%)**

* SMCI already has deep regional partnerships (Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi), so 10–25% is well within reach.
* But **50–100%** would likely require **exclusive national alignment**, which is rare unless the vendor is sovereign or majority-owned.

**5. First-Mover Advantage &amp; Time-to-Deploy (10%)**

* SMCI’s lead time (3–4 weeks vs. 8–12 weeks) is a massive advantage.
* For urgency-sensitive contracts, this could **justify awarding 25% or more** — but not 100%, barring a disruption in Dell/HPE supply.

I think its also important to add, two job listenings have been posted for positions in Abu Dhabi:

All in all, SMCI could stand to make a assload of money from a G42 UAE deal.

TL:DR: SMCI provides the fastest Time-to-Deployment of any of its competitors with its liquid-cooled DCBBS solution and this could help increase margins overtime and make it a more attractive buy to larger customers ready to deploy immediately. Capturing even 5% of the G42 UAE deal could result in a share price of $180+ a share. SMCI is already hiring for positions in Abu Dhabi.

52,DELL,What a UAE Deal Might Mean For SMCI,"This has been a pretty eventful week for SMCI and the AI sector as a whole. the acquisition of a [$20 billion deal](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/saudis-datavolt-signs-20bn-deal-with-supermicro/) with DataVolt in Saudi Arabia and a 39% jump in share price off the strength of the news and overall AI sentiment improving is enough to make any degen hard as solid veiny diamonds. One thing this week that has especially caught my eye is UAE's plan to construct a [5GW AI Campus](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2025/05/uae-and-us-presidents-attend-unveiling-phase-1-new-5gw-ai-campus-abu), with the help of G42, that will house 5GW worth of data center racks and span **10 square miles**.

To put this into perspective, thats:

* 50k 100kW full-scale liquid-cooled racks
* 3.2 **million** Nvidia Blackwell (B100) chips
* More power than NYC and San Francisco **combined**
* Equivalent to powering **3-4 million** homes or running **50 million** gaming PCs at full power 24/7

As you can see, this is an insanely ambitious feat the UAE is trying to achieve. Nonetheless, I couldn't help but ask myself, of the roughly 50k racks the UAE plans to procure, how many of those racks will be SMCI? Furthermore, whatever amount of racks SMCI does provide, how much money does SMCI stand to make from the project? Most importantly, What does that mean for the share price?

First, we need to understand what DCBBS is, and how it actually benefits customers with large scale projects like the UAE AI Campus.

DCBBS stands for **Direct Connect Backplane Building Block Solutions**, and it’s SMCI's proprietary system architecture for building **full AI racks,** not just individual servers. This means when a customer selects which AI rack configuration they want, when it arrives at their door, it comes in a form [like this](https://trendspider.com/blog/dell-and-super-micro-power-musks-ai-ambitions/). In other words, customers are getting Kitchen-Aid refrigerators sent to their fucking door that contain 30-90 Nvidia Blackwell chips and liquid cooling systems within them. No more receiving your SMCI rack order in individual server pieces that you have to assemble on your own. This greatly increases the speed in which these new data centers can go live. In most cases, these racks can be installed and plugged in in **under a day.**

Additionally, this also helps to increase their margins over time.

Traditionally, SMCI sold servers as modular building blocks. things like:

* 1U and 2U server chassis
* Motherboards
* Power supplies
* GPU trays

Customers (like system integrators, VARs, or hyperscalers) would assemble these into racks themselves. That’s low-margin business, because you’re selling parts, not solutions. the DCBBS racks contain:

* CPU &amp; GPU servers (e.g., Nvidia Blackwell, AMD EPYC, Intel Gaudi)
* Total liquid cooling (cold plates, manifolds, chillers, etc.)
* Network switches
* Rack management software
* Power distribution units (PDUs)

Why does this new model increase margins? Because it is a shift SMCI is making, from selling modular pieces that must be assembled, to selling complete solutions that are pre-assembled and ready for use upon arrival. This gives SMCI increased pricing power and in turn, increased margins. Below is a comparison table to illustrate the logic:

|Old Model (Per Server)|Rack-Scale Model (Per Rack)|
|:-|:-|
|Sell parts separately|Sell the full system integration|
|$5K–$15K ASP/server|$250K–$2M ASP per rack|
|6–10% gross margin|**15–25%+ gross margin**|
|Low-value add|**Turnkey AI solution** = premium pricing|

Now lets go more in depth:

**1. Higher Average Selling Price (ASP) per Unit**

* Traditional air-cooled servers sell for **$10K–$50K** each.
* Liquid-cooled **DCBBS racks** (often 64–96 GPUs) sell for **$2–5 million per rack**.
* Even if gross margins stay in the 8–10% range, **gross profit per rack is 40×–80× higher** than per-server sales.

Higher ASP = greater dollar-margin per unit sold, allowing SMCI to increase overall margins even with a similar percentage.

**2. Bundled Value = Control Over Margin Levers**

With DCBBS, SMCI is not just selling a server, it’s delivering:

* 8–12 liquid-cooled GPU servers
* 2000+ liquid-cooled racks a month
* Integrated CDUs (coolant distribution units)
* Power delivery + networking
* Cabling, plumbing, and chassis integration
* Software/BIOS optimization

All of these are designed, manufactured, and **assembled in-house**, which means:

1. Vertical integration reduces dependency on low-margin commodity components
2. Custom bundles let SMCI charge more for value-added services
3. Standardization improves yield, reduces warranty risk, and shortens labor cycles

**3. Faster Time-to-Deployment = Premium Pricing Power**

SMCI can ship **fully integrated, plug-and-play racks in 3–4 weeks**, while others take 8–12 weeks+ with multiple vendors.

For hyperscalers and AI startups racing to bring GPU clusters online, this **speed translates into willingness to pay more**, or at least not negotiate down.

For example: A customer buying a $2.5M rack from SMCI may avoid:

* Extra $500k/month in AI cloud rental costs
* 3–4 month delay in deploying AI training models
* Facility delays in retrofitting for traditional HVAC-based servers

Below is a table below comparing liquid-cooled racks Time-to-Deployment between SMCI and its competitors:

|**Vendor**|**Liquid-Cooled Rack Output (Est.)**|**Time to Deployment**|**Notes**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**SMCI**|**\~2,000+ racks/month**|**3–4 weeks** (from factory)|DCBBS fully integrated, scalable, Blackwell-ready|
|**Dell**|*Unknown (not disclosed)*|\~6–10 weeks (unverified)|IR7000 liquid-cooled racks for hyperscalers, but no output figures released|
|**HPE**|*Limited modular deployments*|\~8–12 weeks (pods)|Offers liquid-cooled AI systems (e.g. Cray EX, Apollo), but mostly for supercomputing clients|
|**Lenovo**|*Unknown*|6+ weeks (via FIS programs)|Neptune liquid cooling, but most integration is not turnkey at SMCI pace|

This “time-value” premium enhances margin per contract.

**4. Liquid Cooling = Lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for Clients**

Clients benefit from:

* 30–50%+ reduction in power usage (no fans/blowers at server level)
* Higher rack density → fewer racks → less real estate
* Reduced HVAC burden → capex + opex savings

Because DCBBS racks are pre-validated and ready for 80–100+ kW loads, customers can safely go denser per rack — which:

* Makes SMCI’s per-rack offering more economically valuable
* Lets them preserve pricing vs. air-cooled OEMs like Lenovo, HPE, or Dell, who may cut prices to remain competitive

Higher value-to-customer means more pricing power = higher gross margin

**5. Operational Efficiency at Scale**

SMCI is building out:

* A 3 million square foot manufacturing campus in Silicon Valley and Malaysia
* A supply chain optimized for GPU pre-allocation, liquid cooling parts, and just-in-time rack assembly

This allows SMCI to:

* Mass produce racks with minimal retooling
* Reduce per-rack cost at high volume
* Use contract-based repeat orders (like the DataVolt $20B deal) to plan capacity

Economies of scale + predictable assembly processes = declining cost/unit → rising margin

Below is a comparison table illustrating the margin impact:

|**Advantage**|**Margin Impact**|
|:-|:-|
|High ASP per rack|Higher gross profit in dollar terms|
|Bundled hardware/services|Increases perceived value + vertical profit|
|Speed to deploy (3-4 weeks)|Pricing premium vs. slower OEMs|
|Energy/cooling savings for customer|Improves TCO → preserves SMCI pricing power|
|Factory integration at scale|Lowers per-rack cost with volume|

So far, we've learned how DCBBS can substantially decrease build times for customers and how it could potentially increase margins for SMCI.

Now to the fun part: The UAE Deal

After doing some ape fisted carpet eating math, I estimate that the total cost of the 5GW AI Campus would be about $125 billion (assuming **each rack** draws about 100kW and sells for $2.5 million). Based on these numbers, I had ChatGPT build a table with a break down of what SMCI would get based on various percentages of the project they would be responsible for and superimposed a likelihood of occurrence formula in there:

|Coverage %|Likelihood of Occurrence|Racks Provided|G42 Total Payment to SMCI|Estimated Gross Profit (USD) 9.7%|Estimated EBITDA (USD)|Estimated EPS|Implied Share Price (@20x PE)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|

As you can see, even with a conservative PE of 20x and 9.7% margins, if SMCI gets even 2-5% of the project, thats an EPS of $3.75-9.37 and a share price of $75-187 a share.

* To hit 50–100% coverage of a 5GW facility, they’d need to commit 6–12 months of global capacity, which limits probability unless it's multi-year.

**4. Geopolitical Alignment (15%)**

* SMCI already has deep regional partnerships (Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi), so 10–25% is well within reach.
* But **50–100%** would likely require **exclusive national alignment**, which is rare unless the vendor is sovereign or majority-owned.

**5. First-Mover Advantage &amp; Time-to-Deploy (10%)**

* SMCI’s lead time (3–4 weeks vs. 8–12 weeks) is a massive advantage.
* For urgency-sensitive contracts, this could **justify awarding 25% or more** — but not 100%, barring a disruption in Dell/HPE supply.

I think its also important to add, two job listenings have been posted for positions in Abu Dhabi:

All in all, SMCI could stand to make a assload of money from a G42 UAE deal.

TL:DR: SMCI provides the fastest Time-to-Deployment of any of its competitors with its liquid-cooled DCBBS solution and this could help increase margins overtime and make it a more attractive buy to larger customers ready to deploy immediately. Capturing even 5% of the G42 UAE deal could result in a share price of $180+ a share. SMCI is already hiring for positions in Abu Dhabi.

54,DELL,US Economy Contracts for First Time Since 2022 on Imports Surge,"&gt;The US economy contracted at the start of the year for the first time since 2022 on a monumental pre-tariffs import surge and softer consumer spending, a first snapshot of the ripple effects from President Donald Trump’s trade policy.

&gt;Inflation-adjusted gross domestic product decreased an annualized 0.3% in the first quarter, well below average growth of about 3% in the prior two years, according to the government’s initial estimate published Wednesday. Net exports subtracted nearly 5 percentage points from GDP, the most on record, the Bureau of Economic Analysis report showed.

&gt;Consumer spending — which accounts for two-thirds of GDP — advanced at a 1.8% pace, the weakest since mid-2023. Business outlays for equipment, the lone bright spot in the report, increased an annualized 22.5%.

|Indicator|Actual|Estimate|
|:-|:-|:-|
|GDP|\-0.3%|\-0.2%|
|Personal consumption|\+1.8%|\+1.2%|
|PCE price index, excl. food, energy|\+3.5%|\+3.1%|

&gt;The GDP data highlight the scramble by companies to secure merchandise ahead of expansive tariffs. Looking ahead, many economists anticipate the higher duties will cause a supply shock, challenging businesses and leading to a pullback in demand as higher prices push cash-strapped Americans closer to the brink.

&gt;Forecasters currently see nearly even odds of the US falling into a recession in the next year. Consumers are also growing increasingly anxious that tariffs will take a toll on the labor market and drive up the cost of living.

&gt;The latest GDP figures showed imports surged an annualized about 41% — the biggest advance in nearly five years. Because these goods and services aren’t produced in the US, they are subtracted from GDP. Economists see the sharp widening of the trade deficit reversing in the second quarter.

&gt;Typically, imported merchandise moves into warehouses or directly to storefronts. However, the report showed business inventories contributed 2.25 percentage points to GDP during the quarter, the most since the end of 2021. The recent flood imports may instead show up in higher inventories in coming months and, along with a narrowing trade gap, provide a lift to second-quarter GDP.

&gt;Because swings in trade and inventories can sometimes distort overall GDP, economists prefer looking at final sales to private domestic purchasers for a better snapshot of demand. This measure increased at a 3% pace in the first quarter after rising an annualized 2.9% at the end of 2024.

&gt;Growth in consumer spending was driven by services and nondurable goods.

**My take:** As is commonly said, we haven't even begun to feel the effects of Trump's trade policy yet- shortages of products haven't begun hitting American consumers, but we're going to start feeling the effects this summer. We're likely in for a painful day in the markets today.

I'm mainly interested in consumer discretionary companies to day trade (SBUX mainly) and also watching tech names like SMCI (earnings), NVDA/DELL/AMD (off of the new Deepseek news).

18,DELL,LyondellBasell $LYB Stock Discussion,"This is NOT financial advice.  I could be incorrect on anything written below.

**Overview and Operation:**

LyondellBasell Industries N.V.  (Lion-dell-buh-sell) $LYB

LYB makes chemicals internationally, sold to businesses who use them make a variety of products.  These chemicals are commodities where global market sets price, and demand is subject to economic cycles. The CEO describes the current period as biggest cyclical downturn in his career.

For operation in the Americas, access to cheaper feedstock combined with vertical integration bolsters margins relative to other chemical producers in the market in the following way:

Step 1: LYB takes cheap US shale gas and uses it to make propylene and ethylene in their cracker plants.

Step 2: Uses this propylene and ethylene as inputs to make multiple chemicals it sells to other businesses:

1. Polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) plastics - ""O&amp;P Americas segment""
2. Basket of interrelated chemicals e.g. propylene oxide, etc. - ""I&amp;D segment"" (which also has international operations)
3. Licenses some of its specialized processes in making these chemicals to other businesses- ""Technology segment""

**Q1 2025 Segment EBITDA**

O&amp;P Americas: 251M

I&amp;D: 211M (excluding items)

Technology: 52M

Advanced Polymer Systems: 46M

O&amp;P Europe/Asia/International: 17M

**2024 Performance:**

40.3B revenue

net income 1.36B

cash on hand 3.388B

total assets 35.7B, liabilities 23.272B; total shareholder equity therefore 12.474B

increased dividend by 7% in 2024, 14 years of dividend growth

management committed to 70% of FCF returned to shareholders longterm

**What I'm thinking:**

Industry is in cyclical downtown, combined with recent tariff-related economic uncertainty, has suppressed share price.  However, it was noted in Q1 call that tariffs affect 10% of their business, and they expect cyclicality to eventually recover.  Meanwhile management is being disciplined with cash.  At current stock price of $59.66 one is getting a 8.95% dividend, while LYB stock historically has traded around $85-$100 levels.  Perhaps one could buy low and be generously paid to wait for share price recovery.  What are your thoughts on this company?",8,13,1745625462.0,2025-04-25T23:57:42+00:00,t3_1k7zm07,wallstreetbets

55,DELL,"Trump &amp; Lutnick’s Semiconductor Tariff Chaos: A Bull Trap, Insider Trading, and Market Manipulation Exposed","Alright, Reddit, buckle up because we’re diving into the absolute rollercoaster that is Trump’s tariff policy on semiconductors, spearheaded by his Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. This is a wild ride of mixed signals, market swings, and what smells like blatant manipulation to make billionaires richer while the rest of us get played. If you’re in the markets or just curious about how the sausage gets made in DC, you need to read this. Monday’s announcement is going to be a doozy, and I’m calling it now: we’re staring down a potential disaster for the semiconductor industry, a textbook bull trap, and some seriously shady insider trading vibes.

Let’s start with the Friday bombshell. On April 11, 2025, the **Trump administration** dropped a *memo* that had Wall Street doing cartwheels: semiconductors, smartphones, laptops, and a bunch of other electronics were exempted from the massive “reciprocal” tariffs Trump slapped on China (we’re talking 125% levies—insane). The U.S. Customs and Border Protection bulletin listed **20 product categories, including memory chips, disc drives, and flat panel displays, all getting a free pass.** Tech stocks like Apple, Dell, and NVIDIA went nuts. The S&amp;P 500 was already down 10% since Trump took office, so this felt like a lifeline. Futures soared, X was buzzing with “bull market confirmed” takes, and everyone thought we were headed for a recovery rally. I mean, who wouldn’t be bullish? It looked like Trump was giving Big Tech a massive break.

But then, Sunday morning hits, and **Howard Lutnick** goes on ABC’s This Week and basically says, **“Psych!”** He clarified that those exemptions? Yeah, they’re *temporary.* Semiconductors and electronics are still getting hit with **“sector-specific”** tariffs in **“a month or two,”** tied to national security under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act. These aren’t negotiable, unlike the reciprocal tariffs. Lutnick’s exact words: “These are things that are national security, that we need to be made in America.” Suddenly, the whole narrative flips. The Friday exemption wasn’t a win—it was a head fake. And now, Monday’s announcement is looming, where Trump’s expected to double down on these semiconductor tariffs, potentially spelling chaos for the industry.

Let’s talk about why this is a big deal for semiconductors. The global chip supply chain is insanely complex. Most semiconductors are designed in the U.S., fabricated in Taiwan (TSMC, anyone?), and assembled or finished in places like China. If Trump slaps tariffs on chips coming from China—or worse, starts a national security probe that messes with the whole supply chain—prices are going to spike. Companies like NVIDIA, AMD, and Qualcomm are going to take a hit, not to mention downstream players like Apple, who assemble iPhones in China. Lutnick’s pushing this “re-shore to America” narrative, but building chip fabs in the U.S. takes years and billions of dollars. TSMC’s Arizona plant isn’t even fully online yet! In the meantime, costs go up, supply chains choke, and consumers get stuck with pricier gadgets—or straight-up shortages.

Now, let’s get to the bull trap. Friday’s exemption announcement was like **catnip for traders.** Everyone piled into tech stocks, thinking the tariff threat was gone. But Lutnick’s Sunday comments yanked the rug out. Posts on X were already screaming about it: “Yesterday’s exemptions weren’t surrender—they were a setup,” one user said. Another called it a “headline-driven market” where the administration is “steering price action.” If Monday’s announcement confirms heavy tariffs, those bullish bets from Friday are going to get crushed. We could see a brutal sell-off in semiconductor stocks, dragging the Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 down with it. The market’s already been a mess—wildest swings since COVID, down 10% since January 20. This could be the trap that catches all the dip-buyers off guard.

And here’s where it gets really ugly: the insider trading and market manipulation angle. Let’s rewind to April 9, when Trump posted on Truth Social, **“THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!! DJT,”** just hours before he announced a 90-day tariff pause for most countries (except China). The S&amp;P 500 surged 9%, Nasdaq jumped 12.2%, and Trump Media’s stock shot up 22%. Coincidence? Democrats like Adam Schiff and Maxine Waters aren’t buying it. They’re calling for SEC investigations, saying Trump’s post reeks of insider trading. Schiff’s letter to the White House asked who knew about the tariff pause beforehand and whether anyone traded on it. When Trump was asked when he decided on the pause, he was cagey: “Over the last few days… probably came together early this morning.” Yeah, right.

Fast forward to this weekend’s semiconductor flip-flop, and it’s déjà vu. Friday’s exemption pumps the market, Lutnick’s Sunday reversal sets up a crash, and Monday’s announcement could be the knockout punch. The timing is too convenient. Billionaires like Bill Ackman, who’s been cozy with Trump but criticized tariffs, are probably sitting pretty, knowing the playbook. Meanwhile, retail traders who went all-in on Friday are about to get smoked. It’s not just Trump’s Truth Social posts—Lutnick’s been all over TV, hyping tariffs one day, backtracking the next. The mixed signals aren’t just chaotic; they’re starting to look deliberate. As one X post put it, “The biggest rally of the year would come on the day Lutnick gets fired.” That’s the vibe right now.

Why does this matter? Because semiconductors are the backbone of everything. Your phone, your car, your fridge—they all need chips. If Trump and Lutnick tank the industry with tariffs, it’s not just stock prices that suffer. Inflation’s already a worry (economists have been screaming about tariffs spiking prices), and chip shortages could make 2021’s supply chain mess look like a picnic. Plus, China’s not sitting still—they hiked their own tariffs to 125% on Friday and are “evaluating” Trump’s exemptions. This could spiral into a full-blown trade war, and guess who pays the price? Not the billionaires with their offshore accounts—us.

So, what’s the play here? Brace yourself. Monday’s announcement could confirm tariffs that gut semiconductor stocks and ripple through tech. If you’re holding NVIDIA or TSMC, maybe hedge with some puts. Cash is king if the market tanks. And keep an eye on X and Truth Social—Trump’s posts are basically market signals now, legal or not. The bigger picture? This administration’s tariff policy is a clown show, and Lutnick’s either in over his head or part of the game. Either way, the semiconductor world’s about to get rocked, and not in a good way.What do you all think? Are we headed for a crash? Is this insider trading staring us in the face?

Drop your takes below—I’m all ears.

**TL;DR:** Trump’s Friday exemption for semiconductors was a head fake that pumped the market. Lutnick’s Sunday reversal sets up a brutal Monday announcement that could crush the chip industry. This smells like a bull trap, with insider trading and market manipulation letting Trump’s billionaire buddies cash in while retail gets screwed. Semiconductors are about to take a beating—watch out.

19,DELL,Why are SMCI and DELL always chosen together for AI infrastructure? What’s the deal?,"I’ve been digging into the recent AI data center plays, and something keeps bugging me.

Elon’s xAI reportedly picked both $SMCI and $DELL for its AI infrastructure. Now we’re hearing Apple is doing the same this year.

So here’s my question:
Why are they always bundling SMCI and DELL together?
If SMCI is the market leader in liquid cooling and has the bleeding-edge tech for AI servers, why not just go all-in on them?

Is this a case of:
	•	Dell having better enterprise logistics or support?
	•	Some kind of scale balancing? (SMCI = high-performance racks, Dell = standardization?)
	•	Risk mitigation by not going full SMCI?
	•	Or is there something SMCI doesn’t do well that Dell covers?

Just feels weird that the “AI Arms Race” giants are choosing both like it’s a power combo.
Any insights? Anyone with industry knowledge want to weigh in?

SMCI was the biggest one (took a toll on my emotional health for many months) bought at $620 pre split and was lucky enough to average down and break even @ $35.

the only stock that made me money was AMZN i sold @ 235 which i had bought for 164 last August.

  
However, i made the biggest investing mistake of my life putting my life savings into NVDA @ 124$ a share (i took huge risk because i came from nothing and i wanted to become someone, thinking this stock was actually good).



i am selling my NVDA stock (which wiped 6 months of my gains) and making the decision thats good for my mental and financial health.

21,DELL,Dell Gives Strong Profit Outlook With AI Server Backlog Climbing,"&gt; Dell Technologies Inc. gave a full-year profit outlook that topped estimates and said it had booked large deals for AI servers.

&gt; Earnings, excluding some items, will be about $9.30 a share on sales of $101 billion to $105 billion in the fiscal year ending in January 2026, the Texas-based company said Thursday in a statement. Analysts, on average, projected profit of $9.24 a share on revenue of $103 billion.

&gt; The need for computing to run AI tools has led to a boom for makers of high-powered servers like Dell, Super Micro Computer Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. Dell’s backlog for AI servers jumped to $9 billion after the end of the fourth quarter after deals with Elon Musk’s xAI and other customers, Chief Operating Officer Jeff Clarke said in the statement.

&gt; For the full year, Dell expects $15 billion in revenue from AI servers. That’s roughly a 50% jump over the $9.8 billion of AI servers it shipped in the fiscal year that ended in January 2025.",44,22,1740692768.0,2025-02-27T21:46:08+00:00,t3_1izrf65,wallstreetbets
57,DELL,SMCI should have a stellar few days.,"SMCI, one of several AI stocks I invested in and recommended in early 2023, saw over tenfold gains before crashing due to overly optimistic projections and accounting concerns, leading to delayed SEC filings and the resignation of its auditors.

Now, SMCI faces a crucial deadline—it must submit its overdue 10-K and 10-Q filings by Feb 25 to avoid potential delisting. If they file on time, the stock will surge significantly, but short sellers are pushing a bearish narrative, betting on a missed deadline and Nasdaq removal. 

However, a lack of insider selling and institutional shorting suggests confidence in an on-time filing, making the current price potentially undervalued. If you already have a brokerage account and risk capital, SMCI may present a speculative opportunity ahead of the filing. That said, this can be seen as a high-risk, short-term bet, not a typical long-term investment. However, longer-term, SMCI remains a strong AI player, uniquely positioned to benefit from demand for custom-built AI servers, especially for Nvidia’s chips, while competitors like Dell and Lenovo lag behind. 



High Confidence for a Timely 10-K...

🚀 SMCI 10-K FILING: LESS THAN 24 HOURS TO GO 🚀

The probability of an on-time 10-K filing (Feb 25, 2025) is estimated at over 90% based on available data.


---

🔹 NO NOTICE OF LATE FILING

SMCI has historically provided 1-3 days’ notice when they were unable to file on time.

No notice has been given yet about a delay for the Feb 25, 2025, deadline, strongly suggesting they are on track.

📌 Key Insight: If SMCI were going to miss tomorrow’s deadline, we likely would have already heard by now.

🟢 BOTTOM LINE: No delay notice = strong confidence in an on-time filing.


---

🔹 KEY REASONS FOR CONFIDENCE

✅ INSTITUTIONAL CONFIDENCE

Large investors reviewed SMCI’s financials for the recent $700M convertible note offering.

Institutions require transparency before committing capital, indicating the 10-K is largely complete.


✅ NO MAJOR ACCOUNTING ISSUES

The latest 8-K filing flagged no major financial discrepancies, reducing concerns about serious accounting restatements.


✅ HISTORICAL PRECEDENT

Most companies in similar situations file on time to maintain credibility with investors and regulators.


✅ MORGAN STANLEY’S STRUCTURED INVESTMENT

Morgan Stanley issued market-linked securities (MLS) tied to SMCI’s stock, meaning institutional capital is betting on its future performance.

These securities offer contingent coupon payments of 31.25% annually, reinforcing that major financial institutions see upside potential in SMCI.



---

🔹 IMPACT OF THE MORGAN STANLEY STRUCTURED INVESTMENT

📌 What does this mean for SMCI investors?

Reinforces institutional confidence in SMCI.

Could influence price action, especially if short sellers try to manipulate volatility.

Signals that major financial players see an opportunity in SMCI despite recent concerns.



---

🔹 WHAT TO EXPECT TOMORROW

⏳ TIMING:

The 10-K will likely be filed after-hours, around 4:30–5:00 PM EST.


📉 PRICE ACTION:

If the stock dips intraday, it may be due to weak hands selling in fear.

Once the filing is confirmed, upside potential is high.

Morgan Stanley’s structured investment may exacerbate volatility as institutions hedge their positions, amplifying swings both up and down.


📈 LONG-TERM OUTLOOK:

SMCI remains fundamentally strong.

Once the uncertainty of the delayed 10-K is removed, the stock has room to climb significantly.



---

🔹 MINOR RISKS TO CONSIDER

⚠️ REGULATORY SCRUTINY

The SEC &amp; DOJ investigations (linked to Hindenburg allegations) exist.

However, no fraud or major restatements have been indicated.


⚠️ MARKET VOLATILITY

Stock price fluctuations may continue, but they do not affect the likelihood of the filing itself.



---

🔹 FINAL THOUGHT

We are very close to the finish line.

If SMCI delivers on time, expect:
✅ Relief buying
✅ Short covering
✅ Strong momentum

If the stock drops further before the filing, it may present a buying opportunity for those with conviction.

Stay focused—tomorrow could be a major turning point. 🚀

5,DELL,Buying calls post-earnings overreaction,"Hello,

I am fairly new with options trading, but I have quite some experience with regular stocks. I believe I have developed a decent strategy with which I have had some success, but I'd like some feedback on it regardless.

Usually, my strategy is to watch for heavy market overreactions to certain earnings, check for an IV below 40%, and buy calls 30-45 DTE out. And uh... that's it.

I've made around $5000 from it already, primarily from UBER, LYFT, DELL, etc etc.

While it is occasionally difficult to understand whether something is an ""overreaction"" and whether a rebound is priced into the calls themselves, usually it is still decently predictable and can be understood with some research - i.e. a company misses on immediate EPS and quarterly revenue, but has solid outlook and good revenue forecasts for the future.

Obviously this strategy is intentionally simplistic and quite easy to follow, but I'd like to hear other peoples' thoughts on this.

Thank you so much.",24,7,1740396446.0,2025-02-24T11:27:26+00:00,t3_1iwzw4v,options

58,DELL,Nvidia Suppliers Send Mixed Signals for Delays on GB200 Systems – What It Means for NVDA Stock,"Recently Analyst Beth Kindig, a bullish analyst, put out an interesting newsletter that was surprisingly bearish on Nvidia due to their supplier commentary. Earnings on Wednesday should be very interesting. Here’s a consolidated copy

Super Micro Lowers FY25 Revenue Guide, Pushes Back 30% Liquid Cooling Target


Super Micro recently reported preliminary fiscal Q2 results, in which it cut its fiscal 2025 revenue guide while hinting that Blackwell GPUs could take longer to ramp in the first part of the calendar year.

At Computex in June 2024, CEO Charles Liang stated that he “expects 15 percent of racks [SMCI] sells this year to use DLC, and 30 percent to employ it [in 2025].” In August 2024,  Liang slightly changed his tune, noting that they now expect “25% to 30% of the new global datacenter deployments to use DLC solutions in the next 12 months.”

I remember this comment well, as it was part of the evidence used to debunk the August rumors considering SMCI had moved up their timeline for DLC delivery (from end of year 2025 to mid-year 2025).

Two weeks ago in the February 2025 report, this timeline was shifted back with Liang stating that Super Micro now believes that “DLC or overall liquid cooling market share will grow all the way to 30% or even more in the next 12 months” -- it’s not a dramatic shift in tone but rather pushes the 30% target back from mid-year 2025 noted in August, to beyond the original year-end timeline --- to now technically being early 2026.

The August earnings call also housed one critical piece of information regarding Blackwell and Super Micro’s 2025 revenue. Wells Fargo’s Aaron Rakers questioned management about Blackwell and guidance for December 2024 and onwards. Liang explained that for the December quarter, Blackwell “will be very small. Engineering sample small volume. So the real volume, I believe, had to be March quarter next year. And that's why we foresee only $26 billion to $30 billion.”

But now, SMCI implied they are not able to ship Blackwell in the March quarter:

Super Micro has walked back the revenue guide that hinged on Blackwell’s NVL systems shipping in volume in the March quarter. Management was also quite clear that the new product was facing a delay as they await more GPU supply.

Vertiv Signals Softer Q1


Vertiv is a provider of thermal and power management solutions and is a leader in direct liquid cooling. The company stated they benefited from a “particularly strong” Q4, with revenue rising nearly 26% YoY as they overdelivered by nearly $200 million as customers wanted products as soon as possible.

Vertiv’s strength in Q4 may be tied to key partner Dell, as its AI server backlog in fiscal Q3 (October quarter) rose more than 18% QoQ to $4.5 billion after being flat QoQ in Q2, and its AI pipeline rising more than 50% QoQ. Analysts placed Dell’s AI server pipeline at $16 to $17 billion, up from $11 to $13 billion previously, a rather large jump for one quarter. However, Dell noted that one factor for its softer Q4 and fiscal year guide was the “unpredictability of the AI shipments” as there are “some more timing differences than what we were anticipating when we gave the guide the last quarter.”

For Q1, Vertiv guided a deceleration to 19% YoY growth, with FY25 revenue growth guided at 16%. Management defended this deceleration into Q1 by saying: “Now of course, Q4 was particularly strong. So we should not look at Q1 as a quarter-to-quarter, really look at the first quarter sales as the acceleration that has taken place. With a 19% organic growth in the first quarter, I feel very, very good about what that tells us about our overall trajectory” and also that it is “higher than what we actually saw in 2024.”

Liquid cooling capacity is not a constraint for Vertiv, as they had said last summer that they were “on track to finish in 2024 with a 45x capacity increase compared to baseline at the end of 2023.”

I agree with the analyst sentiment (and weak price action) following the report that the commentary doesn’t check out exactly. management is contradicting itself by guiding for organic growth of 19% at the midpoint for Q1 but 16% growth for the fiscal year (i.e., slower growth later in the year) while stating shipments will increase QoQ.

Additionally, the QoQ/YoY has to be looked at which is lower than what typical seasonality would account for, as our numbers indicate Vertiv was down (12.1%) due to seasonal sequential growth from Q4-Q1. This year, Vertiv is down (16.9%) from Q4-Q1.

My conclusion (still to be confirmed) is that Vertiv may see a weak Q2 before there is an acceleration into the back half.


Networking Companies Shift Tone on Timing for GB200s


PCIe 6.0 supplier:

PCIe 6.0 is a networking standard expected to initially ship with Nvidia’s Blackwell. A key supplier stated to expect this in the second half of the year, as these products “are driving higher dollar content opportunities [...] on a full rack and full accelerator basis and we expect volume deployments to begin in the second half of this year.”

Revealed at GTC in March of 2024, PCIe 6.0 was initially expected to launch with the GB200s. The following quote from this supplier also hints that merchant GPUs (Nvidia) will not be driving H1 – which would be odd if Blackwell was shipping. “Now, if you look into 2025, we see both contributing growth. The first half of the year will be more predominantly the internal AI accelerator programs. But if you get into the back half of the year, the transition on the merchant GPUs will also be very strong for us. This is where you'll see the custom rack configurations start to deploy and that’s where we see a big dollar increase in our contemporary GPU with [our product] starting to ramp.”

PMIC Suppliers:

PMICs (power management integrated circuits) are a critical part of the picture for Blackwell, given that these components were linked to Blackwell’s rumored power management issues. Major PMIC suppliers were unable to confirm volume shipments in the first quarter in recent earnings calls.

One PMIC supplier that we covered on our Advanced site on Feb 5th, is stating that “We know that we're not the only one players going after this, so the share is still to be determined. The final design, everything is still to be finalized as well, too. So we're working closely with the customer. Again, at this point, we can say that we're targeting for a mid-year launch.”

This company is either discussing Blackwell Ultra with the B300s, or they are implying GB200s are delayed.

The competing PMIC supplier stated: “Just to add a little bit of color to how we see the year rolling out, we believe that we will be off to a slower start in the first half of the year. But as the year develops, the customer base is expected to broaden as hyperscalers launch their new products. We have multiple product ramps with both existing customers as well as with these new hyperscalers.”

The takeaway is that neither PMIC supplier can confirm they are shipping in volume in Q1 or Q2, yet meanwhile, both are saying they are still part of the supply chain.

Semtech Suddenly Pulls Guidance on Active Copper Cabling (ACCs)


Perhaps the most drastic commentary to come out of the last few weeks was when a key supplier pulled its Q1 guidance intra-quarter.

Semtech filed an 8-K stating that “net sales from its CopperEdge products used in active copper cables are expected to be lower than the Company’s previously disclosed floor case estimate of $50 million due to rack architecture changes, with no expected ramp-up over the course of fiscal year 2026.”

ACC content had been estimated to be substantially higher with 36x2 configurations – it had been rumored back in October 2024 that Nvidia was halting development of one of the NVL72 configurations, the NVL36x2, which linked two 36 GPU racks together in a side-by-side system. Semtech pulling guidance strengthens this view.

The shift in architecture to discontinue the 36x2 configuration was said to possibly “disrupt the supply chain for assembly and cooling solutions,” by removing dual-rack configurations and focusing solely on single-rack NVL72 and NVL36 configurations. DLC suppliers have been pushing back Blackwell’s ramp later in the year, suggesting that the market may have faced some impacts from this rumored design change late last year.

While shifting architectures is not a big deal in the medium-term (as stated above, NVL72 single rack configurations are expected to see a higher mix); it’s the suddenness that Semtech pulled it’s guidance that is cause for concern as the company had reaffirmed its optimistic revenue floor guidance  based on two factors – the timing of Blackwell’s launch and changes in rack design. This suggests both factors may be in play, as a late-stage design change was expected to have downstream impacts on timing for DLC ramping.

Conclusion:
Given market jitters around DeepSeek, which turned out to be a non-issue, something more material related to the GB200s, such as growth slowing below expectations at the start of the new fiscal year, could send the stock below $100 -- which we would see as a buying opportunity.

There is a scenario where Nvidia’s stock marches higher – perhaps based on the remaining strength from Hopper and the B200s, B200 HGX systems and B200As packaged with CoWoS-S and having a lower thermal design power (TDP). Or perhaps the string of suppliers discussed here are simply stating the GB200s are not ramping in volume in Q1 but will in Q2.",129,52,1740329696.0,2025-02-23T16:54:56+00:00,t3_1iweku5,stocks

23,DELL,Grok 3: Super Micro Computer (SMCI) Stock Price Outlook: Post-10-K Recovery Analysis,"Let’s analyze Super Micro Computer (SMCI) stock’s potential price trajectory based on its current financial situation, recent guidance, and future expectations, assuming the company files its delayed 10-K by February 25, 2025, resolves its accounting issues, and regains investor trust. The stock is currently around $48 (as of February 17, 2025), down from a pre-split peak of $120 ($1,200 pre-split) when revenue expectations were $15 billion for fiscal 2024. The plunge was driven by Hindenburg Research’s short report, EY’s resignation, and delays in audited financials. With the latest data and CEO Charles Liang’s $40 billion revenue projection for fiscal 2026, I’ll estimate stock prices under conservative, balanced, and optimistic scenarios at key dates: post-10-K (March 2025), end of fiscal 2025 (June 2025), and end of fiscal 2026 (June 2026).

**Current Financial Situation (Latest Available Data)**

SMCI hasn’t filed its fiscal 2024 10-K or fiscal 2025 Q1/Q2 10-Qs, but preliminary results and guidance provide a snapshot:

* Fiscal 2024 (ended June 30, 2024):
   * Revenue: $14.94 billion (reported in preliminary Q4 results, up 110% from $7.12 billion in fiscal 2023).
   * Net Income: \~$1.2 billion (extrapolated from prior quarters and Q4’s $402 million, though unaudited).
   * Gross Margin: 11.2% in Q4 (down from 17% in Q4 2023 due to supply chain costs and AI hardware scaling).
   * Shares Outstanding: \~586 million post-split (adjusted from \~58.6 million pre-split after the 10:1 split on January 27, 2025).
   * EPS (adjusted): $20.46 pre-split ($2.05 post-split) based on analyst consensus for fiscal 2024.
* Fiscal 2025 Q1 (ended September 30, 2024):
   * Preliminary Revenue: $5.9–$6 billion (up 181% YoY from $2.12 billion).
   * Preliminary Gross Margin: 13.3%.
   * Adjusted EPS: $0.75–$0.76 (post-split), exceeding prior guidance of $0.67–$0.83.
* Fiscal 2025 Q2 (ended December 31, 2024):
   * Preliminary Revenue: $5.6–$5.7 billion (up 54% YoY from $3.66 billion).
   * Adjusted EPS: $0.58–$0.60 (post-split), slightly below consensus of $0.61.
   * Guidance lowered from earlier $6–$7 billion due to supply constraints, but still reflects robust AI demand.
* Fiscal 2025 Guidance (full year):
   * Revenue: $23.5–$25 billion (down from $26–$30 billion, aligning with Wall Street’s $24.5 billion estimate).
   * EPS: Analyst consensus \~$2.17 (post-split), up 8% from $2.01 in fiscal 2024.
* Debt: $1.725 billion in 0% convertible notes due 2029, plus a new $700 million 2.25% convertible notes due 2028 (closing \~February 20, 2025). Debt-to-equity ratio is \~0.40, manageable given growth.
* Market Cap: At $48/share, \~$28 billion (586 million shares × $48).

**Future Expectations and Key Drivers**

* Fiscal 2026 Revenue Guidance: CEO Charles Liang projects “at least $40 billion” in fiscal 2026 (ending June 30, 2026), calling it “conservative.” Analysts previously estimated $29.18 billion, so this optimism hinges on:
   * AI Demand: SMCI’s leadership in AI servers, especially with NVIDIA’s Blackwell GPUs and direct-liquid cooling (DLC) tech, drives growth. Partnerships with NVIDIA, xAI (building the 100,000+ GPU Colossus supercomputer), and Fujitsu bolster this.
   * Capacity Expansion: New facilities in Malaysia and Taiwan, plus U.S. production, aim to meet demand.
   * Market Trends: Gartner predicts data center spending will rise 15.5% to $367 billion in 2025, favoring SMCI’s AI hardware niche.
* EPS Growth: Analysts project $2.38 for fiscal 2026 (up 9.7% from $2.17), but Liang’s $40 billion hint suggests potential for $3–$4/share if margins improve (currently squeezed at 13–15% vs. historical 17–18%).
* Risks Resolved: Filing the 10-K by February 25 avoids delisting, quells DOJ/SEC probe fears, and rebuilds trust post-Hindenburg and EY fallout. The Special Committee’s “no fraud” finding helps.

**Valuation Methodology**

SMCI traded at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of \~8 when it hit $120 post-split ($1,200 pre-split) with $15 billion revenue expected—a premium reflecting AI hype. Today, with $14.94 billion in fiscal 2024 revenue and a $28 billion market cap, P/S is \~1.9, well below the tech sector average of 7. I’ll use P/S multiples (conservative: 2, balanced: 4, optimistic: 6) based on revenue projections, cross-checked with P/E (20–30 range) against EPS estimates.

**Price Estimates**

1. March 2025 (Post-10-K Filing, Assuming Filed by February 25):
   * Revenue: Trailing 12 months \~$17 billion (Q3/Q4 2024 + Q1/Q2 2025).
   * EPS: \~$0.60 (Q2 prelim).
   * Conservative: P/S 2 × $17B = $34B market cap → $58/share. (Relief rally, tempered by past issues.)
   * Balanced: P/S 4 × $17B = $68B → $116/share. (Trust regained, AI growth priced in.)
   * Optimistic: P/S 6 × $17B = $102B → $174/share. (Short squeeze + keynote hype.)
2. June 2025 (End of Fiscal 2025):
   * Revenue: $24.5B (midpoint of $23.5–$25B guidance).
   * EPS: $2.17 (analyst consensus).
   * Conservative: P/S 2 × $24.5B = $49B → $84/share. (Steady growth, muted enthusiasm.)
   * Balanced: P/S 4 × $24.5B = $98B → $167/share. (Strong AI traction, P/E \~25 × $2.17 ≈ $54, but P/S drives higher.)
   * Optimistic: P/S 6 × $24.5B = $147B → $251/share. (Peak AI optimism, P/E 30 × $2.17 ≈ $65, P/S dominates.)
3. June 2026 (End of Fiscal 2026):
   * Revenue: $40B (CEO’s “conservative” guidance; optimistic case $45B).
   * EPS: $3.50 (assuming 8.75% net margin on $40B, 586M shares), vs. analyst $2.38.
   * Conservative: P/S 2 × $40B = $80B → $136/share. (Growth priced in cautiously, P/E 20 × $3.50 ≈ $70.)
   * Balanced: P/S 4 × $40B = $160B → $273/share. (P/E 25 × $3.50 ≈ $88, P/S reflects AI leadership.)
   * Optimistic: P/S 6 × $45B = $270B → $461/share. (P/E 30 × $4 ≈ $120, P/S assumes max growth + premium.)

**Prediction and Rationale**

* March 2025: $116 (balanced) seems likely if the 10-K lands cleanly. The recent climb from $40s to $48 reflects anticipation, and a successful filing could double the stock from today’s $48 as shorts cover and confidence returns. $174 (optimistic) is possible with a blowout keynote on February 20.
* June 2025: $167 (balanced) fits if SMCI delivers on $24.5 billion and margins stabilize. $251 (optimistic) requires flawless execution and NVIDIA-driven hype.
* June 2026: $273 (balanced) aligns with $40 billion revenue and a P/S of 4—reasonable given SMCI’s 70% growth in 2025 and 63% projected for 2026. $461 (optimistic) assumes $45 billion and a return to peak AI valuations (P/S 6), rivaling its $70 billion market cap at $120 last year.

**Why These Levels?**

SMCI’s plunge from $120 to $48 reflects a crisis of trust, not fundamentals—revenue doubled since then. At $40 billion in 2026, it’s 2.7× last year’s $15 billion when it hit $120, suggesting $273–$461 is plausible if sentiment rebounds. Partnerships (NVIDIA, xAI), DLC innovation, and $700 million in fresh capital bolster the case. Risks—margin pressure, competition from Dell/HP, or lingering legal overhang—cap the conservative case.",49,23,1739900841.0,2025-02-18T17:47:21+00:00,t3_1isinov,wallstreetbets

59,DELL,Dell shares pop on report of $5 billion deal for AI servers for Elon Musk’s xAI,"[https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/14/dell-shares-pop-on-report-of-5-billion-deal-for-ai-servers-for-elon-musks-xai.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/14/dell-shares-pop-on-report-of-5-billion-deal-for-ai-servers-for-elon-musks-xai.html)

Dell shares jumped to a session high on Friday following a report saying Elon Musk’s startup xAI was getting ready to agree to buy $5 billion in artificial intelligence servers from the hardware maker.

The equipment containing Nvidia’s GB200 graphics processing units would be delivered this year, according to Bloomberg, which cited unnamed sources.

Many data center gear manufacturers have been seeing growth from selling boxes for training and running AI models. Dell said in November that it had $3.6 billion in quarterly AI server order demand. Dell’s total revenue for the quarter ended Nov. 1 totaled $24.37 billion, up 10% year over year.

In December xAI announced a $6 billion funding round. CNBC reported that the Musk startup was raising the money to purchase GPUs. The Grok assistant from xAI is available for people to use on the Musk-owned social network X.

Last summer Musk said Nvidia, X and xAI had contributed to the getting a data center filled with GPUs online in Memphis, Tennessee.",160,26,1739558192.0,2025-02-14T18:36:32+00:00,t3_1iphi3r,stocks
1,DELL,ACHR is a $4.4B market cap company that doesn't sell anything.... Yet,"I want to share a new stock I have recently become obsessed with and that is Archer Aviation. They are creating eVTOL air taxi's for commercial and defense projects. The official drop of their flagship Midnight is as early as Q4'25.

**For my TL/DR folks:** ACHR go BRRR

So what makes this company so special? Why is the market cap \~$4B considering it's P/E ratio is -7.02 and why is the company spending hundreds of millions of dollars a year, while generating $0 in revenue? The short answer is they are building really cool shit, have $6B+ in pre-orders and were just given $301.75M by BlackRock to expand its defense market. Giving the company a liquidity of \~$1B to spend.

Archer is creating piloted air taxis that will work similar jobs as helicopters, the kicker is these planes are electric so they don't make a bunch of noise, and you don't need to maintain a traditional combustion engine which cuts down on maintenance costs. The goal is to have them autonomous in the future, and their whole website is filled with the eco-friendly terminology that a lot of people will get off to. Not sure how eco-friendly deleting terrorist with a silent helicopter is, but who cares. What I care about is: do they have great leadership, a great product, and is the stock under valued.

Lets take a deeper look at **Archers leadership:**

CEO - Adam Goldstein  
CTO - Tom Muniz  
CFO - Mark Mesler  
CE - Dr. Geoff Bower  
CPPO - Tosha Perkins  
GC - Eric Lentell

There is nothing really notable about this crowd of people, they either worked for niche companies, sold their companies for $100M, or worked at big accounting firms that no one gives a shit about. I initially saw this and didn't care about this company myself. However I am a huge fan of Anduril and I was curious how Archer is getting partnerships with leading defense contractors, airlines, automotive companies, etc.

The news wasn't adding up to the experience of the leadership team, so I did more digging and low and behold I stumbled across **their Board of Directors:**

**Deborah Diaz** \- Former CIO and Deputy CIO of NASA, helped stand up the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and formerly was on the board for a few small companies like: Dell Technologies and Forcepoint.

**Fred Diaz** \- Former CEO of Mitsubishi Americas, General Manager Mitsubishi in Japan, VP &amp; GM Nissan, with additional roles at Fiat-Chrysler, Ram Truck Brand, Chrysler Mexico, and so on.

**Oscar Munoz** \- Former CEO of United Airlines, with executive leadership at Continental Airlines, Pepsi Co, Coca Cola, AT&amp;T, and Univision Communications.

**Barbara Pilarski** \- Current Global Head for Stellantis N. V. (Fiat &amp; Chrysler)

**Maria Pinelli and Michael Spellacy** \- Both CPA Wizards working across the America's and worked for large accounting firms like EY, Accenture, etc.

So I see this shit, and it all starts to make sense, you have an executive leadership team that fully understand financing &amp; engineering, backed by a board that understand everything about manufacturing, government process, airline industry, and everything in between.

Now I am thinking this company is too good to be true, what else could they possibly be up to, well the answer is they brought in 12 military consultants, 10 of which are former 2-4 star generals and the other 2 were contracting experts with one specializing in Special Operations Command (SOCOM). These consultants will be driving the discussion on how best to create air taxis for military applications. The partnership with Anduril shines here, because Anduril is the current golden child of government contracting and if they ever went public I would leverage every penny I have on them. A quick google search will show you all the contracts they are winning.

So does it make sense to enter into this stock knowing there is immense risk that this could be a colossal failure. Well I do believe that city congestion is starting to become a big concern, and trains and cars do slow down the process. Does it make sense to use a eVTOL for this type of travel? In my opinion yes, it's a theoretically better helicopter that is quieter and that's a great use case for intra-city travel. Not to mention it's military use cases are limitless for special operations.

Analysts are viewing this company as a strong buy with an average price target of $11.25. GAAP operating expenses for Q4 2024 will range between $120 million and $140 million, with non-GAAP operating expenses aligning with the guidance range of $95 million to $110 million. Total assets according to their quarterly report is $651.5M with $183.8M in total liabilities. Based on the free cash they have now, they have about 2-3 years of runway (thanks for the correction u/[Valuable-Ingenuity99](https://www.reddit.com/user/Valuable-Ingenuity99/)) if they maintain the same spending habits before they implode and I write the losses off in my taxes.

Their **Q4'24 financial results call is scheduled for Feb 27, 2025** and I have purchased **1,600 shares at a fill price of $9.40**. Due to the nature of the company, use cases for both commercial and military applications, the board leading them, and the partnerships/companies they have secured. I believe that this is a company that can realistically pop off, if the Q4'25 launch is a hit. I have an additional $12k that I will be averaging down with, but this is a stock that I feel confidently has the ability to get into the $15+ range, post launch (assuming it's a success).

**Insider Trading Habits:**

Stellantis owns \~59,734,962 shares of ACHR, and has been buying loads of shares since March of 2024. Tom Muniz, Michael Spellacy, both sold around 550k shares near Christmas 2024, with one transaction on 1/7/25. This doesn't alarm me since they are still sitting on over 1m shares each still, and they were likely just buying Christmas presents or selling to pay off their taxes. Brett Adcock isn't listed anywhere on the website, but has Founder as his status for Archer on LinkedIn, looks like hes a degenerate gambler since he has 9 options sales executed within June and July of 2023 alone (one of us). Hes coping by making AI robots in Palo Alto now (golf clap).

For all the reasons outlined in this post I believe this is a moderate to high risk play that can yield some disgustingly high returns should the company perform the way they intend to. This is not a short term play, I intend to hold this for a while. I personally like the stock, and if you feel the same I hope you do your own research before making a conclusion.

But who knows, maybe I'm just regarded.",89,63,1739484042.0,2025-02-13T22:00:42+00:00,t3_1iouthx,investing
25,DELL,Great Time to Scoop up Some AMD!,"I believe the market is overreacting to AMD Q4 earnings, representing a great time to add some shares. Let's get into it.

**Q4 Highlights -**

* Revenue of $7,658 billion, 24% increase YoY.
* Gross Profit of $3,882, 33% increase YoY.
* Increased Gross Margin of 51%.
* Operating Income of $871 million, 155% increase YoY.
* Data Center segment revenue of $3.9 billion, 69% increase YoY.

**Full Year Financial Highlights 2024 -**

* Revenue of $25,785 billion, 14% increase.
* Gross Profit of $12,725 billion, 22% increase.
* Net Income of $1,641, 92% increase.
* Data Center revenue of $12,6 billion, 94% increase.
* Client segment revenue of $7.1 billion, 52% increase.

**My Thoughts &amp; Interpretation of Q4 -** Looking at these numbers, they all seem pretty great. AMD posted a record year in just about every category. They continue to secure deals like the ones made with IBM in November, and with Dell in January. They also continue to innovate with new product releases in order to stay competitive. Investors simply got spooked because of the revenue miss for data centers and lower than expected GPU sales. Is this enough cause for concern? I think not. I find it ridiculous that they experienced 69% growth YoY for Q4 data center revenue, and still got wrecked after earnings, with a 94% increase in the segment for the entire year! The way I see it, they are demonstrating their ability to capture market share. Not to mention they posted record revenue in the client segment. They gave strong guidance, expecting revenue for Q1 2025 of $7.1 billion, which would be 30% YoY growth. This is all bullish to me.

**Key Financial Metrics -** Gross profit as a percentage of sales has been trending upwards for years, now sitting at 53%. This signifies good management and increasing operational efficiency. They have a very low FWD PEG of .57 and FWD P/B ratio of 3.14 representing undervaluation. 

**Average 5-Year Growth Rates -** Revenue Growth = 33.91%. Net Income = 36.92%. EBITDA Growth = 65.27%. FCF Per Share = 68.86%. Working Capital = 44.21%.

**Conclusion -** I think this is a great company that is simply unloved by the market currently. They have done nothing but demonstrate their ability to innovate and compete over the years. This is a trend that I do not see slowing down. The most recent dip presents a great buy opportunity as the price will correct eventually. **At a price per share of $111, I think AMD trades at a bargain considering future growth and the overall potential of the company. $200+ is on the horizon.** \*Que Advanced Money Destroyer jokes\*

61,DELL,"Nvidia sheds almost $600 billion in market cap, biggest one-day loss in U.S. history","Nvidia lost close to $600 billion in market cap on Monday, the biggest drop for any company on a single day in U.S. history.

The chipmaker’s stock price plummeted 17% to close at $118.58. It was Nvidia’s worst day on the market since March 16, 2020, which was early in the Covid pandemic. After surpassing Apple last week to become the most valuable publicly traded company, Nvidia’s drop on Monday led a 3.1% slide in the tech-heavy Nasdaq.

The selloff was sparked by concerns that Chinese artificial intelligence lab DeepSeek is presenting increased competition in the global AI battle. Late last month, DeepSeek unveiled a free, open-source large language model that it says took only two months and less than $6 million to build, using reduced-capability chips from Nvidia, called H800s. 

Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) dominate the market for AI data center chips in the U.S., with tech giants like Alphabet, Meta, and Amazon spending billions of dollars on the processors to train and run their AI models. Analysts at Cantor wrote in a report on Monday that the release of DeepSeek’s latest technology has caused “great angst as to the impact for compute demand, and therefore, fears of peak spending on GPUs.”

The analysts, who recommend buying Nvidia shares, said they “think this view is farthest from the truth,” and that advancements in AI will most likely lead to “the AI industry wanting more compute, not less.”

But after Nvidia’s huge run-up — the stock soared 239% in 2023 and 171% last year — the market is on edge about any possible pullback in spending. Broadcom, the other big U.S. chipmaker to see giant valuation gains from AI, fell 17% on Monday, pulling its market cap down by $200 billion.

Data center companies reliant on Nvidia’s GPUs for their hardware sales saw big selloffs as well. Dell, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Super Micro Computer dropped at least 5.8%. Oracle, a part of President Donald Trump’s latest AI initiative, fell 14%.

For Nvidia, the loss was more than double the $279 billion drop the company saw in September, which was the biggest one-day market value loss in history at the time, unseating Meta’s $232 billion loss in 2022. Before that, the steepest drop was $182 billion by Apple in 2020.

Nvidia’s decline is more than double the market cap of Coca-Cola and Chevron and exceeds the market value of both Oracle and Netflix.

CEO Jensen Huang’s net worth also took a massive hit, declining roughly $21 billion, according to Forbes’ real-time billionaires list. The move demoted Huang to 17th on the richest-person list.

The sudden excitement around DeepSeek over the weekend pushed its app past OpenAI’s ChatGPT as the most-downloaded free app in the U.S. on Apple’s App Store. The model’s development comes despite a slew of recent curbs on U.S. chip exports to China.

Venture capitalist David Sacks, who was tapped by Trump to be the White House’s AI and crypto czar, wrote on X that DeepSeek’s model “shows that the AI race will be very competitive” and that Trump was right to rescind President Joe Biden’s executive order last week on AI safety.

“I’m confident in the U.S. but we can’t be complacent,” Sacks wrote.

Nvidia is now the third most-valuable public company, behind Apple and Microsoft.

SMCI has a darkside but they're also successful and crafty. How long does this run last?  I think NVDA ultimately dumps them, maybe not suddenly, as they need to protect themselves, but there are better options. This stock ran up was incredible last year, almost too much, that was the first red flag in my opinion.

I opened up a position in DELL .

My investment strategies are 95% long term, mostly stocks and ETF's i.e., VGT, FTHI, IWF, IYF, &amp; JEPI . FTHI and JEPI both pay decent monthly dividends.  I mostly invest in tech stocks as I work in tech.  CRWD, AMD, AMZN, PANW and I really like the SMR for powering the hyperscale data centers.",0,33,1736195853.0,2025-01-06T20:37:33+00:00,t3_1hv95ma,wallstreetbets
63,DELL,2025 - The year of data center $pending,"In a surprise move M$FT pulled back the curtain and revealed the $pending budget.

$80B dollar$.

This is just on data centers.

Who are the biggest beneficiaries?

My top 10 favorites that will benefit once MSFT opens the faucet and sends out the orders for equipment.

1. NVDA- No explanation needed.
2. SMCI- (My personal Fav) A close NVDA partner and survivor of a Hindenburg short attack. Earnings growth is just unprecedented. Hope they covered their short.                                                                                       -https://www.supermicro.com/en/solutions/data-management
3. TSM
4. AMD - NVDA's cousin
5. MSFT - Microsoft investing in itself
6. VRT-Data center infrastructure
7. AVGO
8. ORCL
9. Dell
10. OKLO-for power

14,DELL,Rate my portfolio - turnover advice,"I'd appreciate a feedback on my current portfolio. Here are the positions with the % size.

AAPL 2.3%
QQQ 11.4%
DELL 2.8%
IONQ 56.9%
IWQU (iShares World Maxi Quality factor sector neutral) 4.6%
LVMH 3.6%
NVDA 5.7%
SMH 2.1%
CASH 4.1%
Saving deposit (tracking 1Y TBill) 5.9%

All of this are at decent gains, except for DELL which is currently at a -27% loss and I am planning to cut it entirely. IONQ obviously has achieved an extreme gain and I am aware of the concentration risk. I have a price in mind at which I will trim some profit, but I am comfortable with the risk of seeing my portfolio volatility spiking up just because of that position.

In addition to the above holdings and outside of my trading account, I have another 10% in my banking account and I am saving for a mortgage deposit over the next year. Pension contribution is sorted out and my income and earning potential are decent enough to afford the investment risk of my portfolio. 

QQQ and IWQU are the two long term holdings that I am building; I plan to increase these two over time with further contributions and gains from other positions.

CASH is there for buying opportunities if the market dips at any point.

SAVING DEPOSIT might be invested or transferred to my bank account for the mortgage deposit.

I'd like to have your opinion for what I am planning to do with my holdings. I am thinking of the following alternatives:

- sell DELL and LVMH and invest everything in QQQ and IWQU with a 70/30 split
- sell DELL, keep some in CASH, invest the rest in other high risks names that I have been following. 

The reason of these two alternatives is that I prefer not to touch IONQ because it has the potential to generate a life changing wealth, but if I lose it all I am okay with it, and as such I'd rather raise cash from a low growth holding (DELL) and from LVMH that might still grow but I am okay with the profit that I made so far.

I am looking at the evolution of the Semiconductors, hence why I am not touching SMH. I think that the sector has more room to run in 2025, but it will be the next one to liquidate and move to my two long term holdings.

Thanks!

P.S. let's take it for granted that I am an Internet person and by definition I am a liar and none of the above is true when it comes to gains etc.",3,6,1734430101.0,2024-12-17T10:08:21+00:00,t3_1hg7jft,investing

10,DELL,Learned options and made about $15k doing a couple trades every work alongside my FT job this year,"I've been involved in the stock market since 2017 starting off by doing stock trades without any fundamental or technical analysis which didn't take long to realize it's not an efficient way to make money.

I then opted to be a passive trader by buying into ETFs and just letting them grow over time which worked out great however I've always heard about options and it was very intimidating at first but late last year I decided to pick up a book that teaches options trading for beginners and particularly focus on covered calls. Things started to make a little more sense and I began selling/writing covered calls on existing positions I had which you'll see in the beginning months. Then shortly after that I began learning about other strategies and liked the idea of selling short puts or cash secured puts to generate residual income. As you'll see this was when I went from generating a couple hundred dollars a month to $2-3k/month.

The style of trading I enjoy is basically being a seller rather a buyer since I've read most option contracts expire worthless so I try to sell contracts for credit and the cash reserved for those contracts I leave in a money market account which generated 5% earlier this year and went down to 4.2% in the last 2-3 months once the fed cut the rates. It's not life changing amount of money but it's definitely enough to where I can see the potential in being able to double next year.

My filter criteria for looking at contracts to sell are the following:

Delta: 0.2-0.4  
IV: &lt;= 60%  
Options volume: &gt;= 500  
DTE: &lt;=60 days

The reason I'm posting this is to let others who are new to options that it's a journey not a sprint and to be patient. The other reason is to share my learning with others and see if you have advice, pointers, learning resources. I am looking to continue growing and learning about options so I'd like for others to share useful resources if they have something to share. Thank you!

11,DELL,Final Stock Option Plays Dec-Jan 2024/25,"So, with all the chatter about the upcoming tariffs under Donald J. Trump and China’s export ban on rare earth metals like gallium and germanium, I’ve decided to play the downside on some stocks. I made a post last week I think and now I have narrowed it down to just puts. Feel free to chime in.

# 1. Micron Technology (MU)

* **Why:** They’re neck-deep in semiconductors, which need rare materials like germanium and gallium—both of which China is restricting. Tariffs and supply chain disruptions will hit them hard. Plus, geopolitics isn’t doing them any favors.
* **Recovery Timeline:** 12–24 months for supply chains to diversify, so they’re stuck for a while.
* **Play:** Long put, slightly OTM.
* **Expiration:** 12–18 months to catch the peak of the pain from shortages and tariffs.

# 2. Dell Technologies (DELL)

* **Why:** Tariffs + restricted materials = higher costs and squeezed margins. Their reliance on Asian manufacturing and inability to adjust quickly makes them a sitting duck.
* **Recovery Timeline:** 18–36 months to realign supply chains and figure things out.
* **Play:** Long put, ITM for a faster hit.
* **Expiration:** 6–12 months since the short-term damage from supply chain issues should surface soon.

# 3. Jabil Inc. (JBL)

* **Why:** Electronics manufacturing giant = huge reliance on rare materials. Rising input costs and delayed supply chains are going to crush profitability.
* **Recovery Timeline:** 24–36 months to adapt their supply chain and stabilize.
* **Play:** Long put, OTM. This one’s more speculative, but I’m expecting extended pain.
* **Expiration:** 12–24 months for the long-term fallout to play out.

# 4. Visteon Corporation (VC)

* **Why:** Auto electronics supplier that’s caught in the semiconductor storm. Supply chain delays and material costs are going to hurt, plus the auto sector takes forever to recover.
* **Recovery Timeline:** 18–30 months because the auto cycle is slow as hell.
* **Play:** Long put, ITM for quicker downside action.
* **Expiration:** 12 months—short-term hits from semiconductor shortages are likely.

# 5. NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)

* **Why:** GPUs rely on the very materials China’s restricting. Add tariffs and supply chain headaches, and you’ve got some serious downside risk. High valuation means any bad news could cause big drops.
* **Recovery Timeline:** 12–18 months, thanks to their dominance in GPUs and AI, but near-term volatility is the goal here.
* **Play:** Long put, OTM for speculative gains on short-term instability.
* **Expiration:** 12–18 months to ride the volatility before they bounce back.

That’s the plan, folks. Tariffs and rare earth export bans are gonna wreak havoc on these stocks for the foreseeable future. Hoping to cash in before they figure out how to recover. Thoughts? Criticism? Tell me I’m wrong! 🔥",1,3,1733875699.0,2024-12-11T00:08:19+00:00,t3_1hbgej5,options

DD Part 1 --&gt;[ here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h7s0om/rbrk_rubrik/).

**What is Rubrik ?** 

* Rubrik is a backup &amp; recovery provider that sits on top of a company’s cloud infrastructure.

**What is an example of Backup &amp; Recovery I can maybe understand?** 

* You drop your phone under a tire because you were to busy while parking, leading to a smashing of both it and the SIM card. The only fix is you buy a new phone, login with your iCloud email, and everything is restored from the cloud.
* Rubrik does the above and sells at-cost servers from partners like Dell, HPE, SMCI, etc. They protect data in places like AWS , Azure, and GCP.
* People pay whatever when they have no phone or car. Same here.

**Why am I following up?**

13,DELL,So Far My Top Picks for the Incoming Tariffs &amp; Rare Earth Export Ban,"With the upcoming **tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China** and **China's export ban on rare earth metals**, I’ve put together some stocks options till now and the start of January.  This isn't set in stone and kind of a rough outline till next week. Let me know your guys thoughts on this.

# Put Options : Companies with Thin Margins and High Exposure to Tariffs and Chines Export Ban

# 1. American Axle &amp; Manufacturing (AXL)

* Relies heavily on Mexican manufacturing for cost-effective production.
* Uses Chinese rare earth metals for driveline systems.
* Thin profit margins make it vulnerable to rising costs.

# 2. Visteon Corporation (VC)

* Specializes in vehicle electronics, relying on Chinese semiconductors.
* Depends on Mexican facilities for manufacturing.
* Highly exposed to supply chain disruptions from tariffs and material bans.

# 3. Jabil Inc. (JBL)

* Operates as a contract manufacturer for electronics, with extensive operations in China and Mexico.
* Sensitive to rising material costs and tariffs on components.
* Margins are at risk due to higher input costs and competitive pressures.

# 4. Dell Technologies (DELL)

* Relies on Chinese manufacturing for laptops and other components.
* Uses assembly plants in Mexico, exposing it to multiple tariffs.
* Thin margins in consumer electronics make it susceptible to profitability pressures.

# 5. Micron Technology (MU)

* Heavily dependent on gallium and germanium, which are restricted by China’s export ban.
* Operates in a cyclical industry that is highly sensitive to input cost increases.
* Risks include margin compression and supply chain disruptions.

# 6. Caterpillar (CAT)

* Relies on steel and aluminum imports from Canada and Mexico.
* Uses advanced materials sourced from China.
* Tariffs and material shortages could inflate costs and slow infrastructure demand.

# 7. Walmart (WMT)

* Operates on razor-thin profit margins (\~2-3%).
* Imports a significant portion of goods from China, Mexico, and Canada.
* Rising costs could impact pricing strategy, profits, and consumer demand.

# Call Options : U.S. Companies That Could Benefit

# 1. MP Materials (MP)

* Produces domestic rare earth materials like gallium and germanium.
* China’s export ban increases demand for U.S.-sourced rare earths.
* Positioned as a key supplier in industries like EVs, defense, and tech.

# 2. Albemarle Corporation (ALB)

* A leading U.S. producer of lithium and advanced materials for EVs and renewable energy.
* Benefits from reduced competition due to tariff-related supply chain shifts.
* Positioned to meet rising demand as the U.S. boosts domestic sourcing.

# 3. Li-Cycle Holdings (LICY)

* Specializes in recycling rare earth materials and lithium batteries.
* As material shortages intensify, companies will increasingly turn to recycling solutions.
* Positioned as a sustainable alternative to supply chain disruptions.

What do you guys think of these picks? I tried going for company's affected by all 3 Tariffs i.e. Mexico, Canada, and China and as well as the export ban and with thin profit margins.",6,3,1733474042.0,2024-12-06T08:34:02+00:00,t3_1h7wx0h,options

**DD Research**

**What is Rubrik ?** 

* Rubrik is a backup &amp; recovery provider that sits on top of a company’s cloud infrastructure.

**What is an example of Backup &amp; Recovery I can maybe understand?** 

* You drop your phone under a tire because you were to busy while parking, leading to a smashing of both it and the SIM card. The only fix is you buy a new phone, login with your iCloud email, and everything is restored from the cloud.
* Rubrik does the above and sells at-cost servers from partners like Dell, HPE, SMCI, etc. They protect data in places like AWS , Azure, and GCP.
* People pay whatever when they have no phone or car. Same here.

**How are you qualified?** 

* I worked at a research company for five years partnering with SaaS vendors $5M-$250M, for two of those years I CAN NEITHER CONFIRM NOR DENY they may have been a client.
* I transitioned to Software Engineering three years ago from Tech Sales. I have tracked them and understand both the sales pitch and technology pitch. 
* I saw them masterfully navigate researchers, which they still do, and become the golden child. Billions of dollars get validated by researchers.... it's importants.
   * [(Updated) They Poached the Magic in 2018](https://www.theregister.com/2018/05/01/rubrik_gartner_hires/). One is doable but not three of them it delayed the research paper a year that doesn’t happen unless a research analyst dies.
   * [(Updated) Because of 2018 poaching the late Fall report never got published (major delay), The 2019 Report Was Fought Back By Rubrik for Flawed Data](https://www.crn.com/news/storage/rubrik-ceo-gartner-data-center-magic-quadrant-seriously-flawed) . I've never seen a CEO do this without blowback Bipul again with a killer move.
   * TL:DR; They were making moves YEARS ago. See article excerpt below.

[This is pretty rare, vendors complain but not publishing a document read by 4k+ CIO controlling the flow of billions of dollars in a sector. It's just insane. There's a lot of big names backing them. ](https://preview.redd.it/x3hcumds365e1.png?width=1152&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f1e26b7a5f66134efaf4447b77fa18f020f0837)

**Who’s in the market? Competitors?** 

https://preview.redd.it/qq3hhafdg55e1.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20d4d8a57db7467d15ffd2abaa24459d6ac8d60c

* Their only publicly traded competitor is Commvault which is around $170 and dropping.
* Veeam and Cohesity are private firms with very different architectures, support qualities, and applications. Rubrik is the only one fully doing what it does. They are considered the “Lexus”

**How are they different?** 

* Rubrik views backup and recovery very differently from legacy vendors. They built their architecture based on expecting to get hacked (Backup &amp; Recovery) vs. trying to prevent a hack (Incident Response). It's never been done ""their way"" before.
* Rubrik creates an air gapped layer on top of databases that - even if a hacker gets in they’re quarantined and the user can restore the system cutting them off. Thus less downtime, less support costs, payroll, legal fees, etc.
* They are very partner friendly with Mandiant, Crowdstrike, and Zscaler at least in the cutthroat cyber industry. 
* Rubrik’s leadership , in particular the CEO Bipul Sinha, are not run of the mill. Bipul is personally a very kind, measured, and calculated leader, I’ve met him before. He’s a lovely man but a killer. He’s an engineer with a sales streak like Elon. Bipul has Nutanix and Bromium under his belt. Google Him. He essentially came out of retirement for this company from a cushy ass VC job. 
* They know how to pitch investors, analysts, sales people, clients, basically everyone. They’re as buttoned up as you get and they come to impress. They earned their street cred 100%. 
* They have consistently ranked as #1 according to Gartner in the Magic Quadrant. Beating out companies with very, very large balance sheets that don't have the balls to IPO in 2024.

**Why the sudden pop? (Things I thought were important)** 

* Analysts needed another leap to profitability  due to the only available historicals  being from the April 2024 IPO and September Q2 earnings. This gave them pause on profitability as Rubrik as high operating margin.
* They raised 2025 Guidance. Indicated profitability by end of next year on this Q3 Earnings.
* Things I Heard on their Q3 Earnings today:
   * They mentioned a Fortune 50 Healthcare company selecting them in a competitive win. UnitedHealthcare was hacked in February and had offline billing systems for like 20 days. I’m thinking they signed UNH, that’s a big cookie boys. It’s super fucking hard to rip and replace a legacy vendor. 
   * They passed $1B in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR). This is a big metric. I heard both the Goldman Sachs and Barclays analysts say “Congrats” they seemed to be teeing up easier questions.   
* [Everyone and their mother in Cybersecurity has heard of Rubrik. They got the same award as Google, Facebook, and others a month ago for Entrepreneurship](https://www.rubrik.com/company/newsroom/press-releases/24/rubrik-named-the-2024-entrepreneurial-company-of-the-year-by-the-harvard-business-school-hbs-association-of-northern-california)

**Why did the stock not move from April to September 2024? (Timeline Below...)**

* **April 24th 2024 IPO Financials**
   *  Rubrik reveals a very high operating margin due to sales and marketing investments aka ripping out Zscaler’s sales team doing the “Salesforce” push. Blitzkreg the market. 
   * I believe they started  planning ripping Zscaler in October 2023 , it takes time to ramp up. They probably got all big sales hires in by March with a six month ramp up take lands sales quotes around September when the stock crept up(
   * [Sniping Zscaler Executives and Top Earners in October 2023. They had to give a fuck ton of stock to pry these boys away. ](https://channeleye.co.uk/rubrik-hires-another-zscaler/)
   * [EDIT: (Updated with New Video) This lead to analyst skepticism about pricing controls. ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzEhqtSrVUE) 
* **Septemeber 9th 2024 Q2 Earnings Financials** 
   * Earnings were month after the late July 2024 Crowdstrike hack, I do not think Rubrik was able to accelerate deal velocity to report ARR high enough to relieve market analysts and critics of the operating margin. They were asked about “deal velocity” by analysts today and it seems like the markets are pleased. 
   * [Bloomberg video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGvI0QbzzkY) from post-earnings is killer and a good recap of market sentiment.
   * [Rubrik Search Trends Peaked In April Coinciding With the Major UNH Hack; however, they droped off after the huge spike.](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;q=rubrik&amp;hl=en)
      * I think analysts expected a quicker deal cycle around the UNH hack, 4 months/120 days is a very fast enterprise sales cycle. Most large sales deals can take 6-12 months if not longer.
* **October 2024:** 
   * I believe deal velocity picked up from the UNH hack and even with low search results, the three week hack fallout was enough to start sales cycles. Then from the Crowdstrike fallout, even as a partner, highlighted the need to immediately solve it as publicly traded companies were literally offline, no one working.
   * Remember 60-120 days is a very fast sales cycle on any software sale. I think this is where we started heating up here as this is three months out from the hack.  
   * Today on earnings analysts seemed eager to ask about profitability as the CFO and CEO were comfortable to voice the 2026 is the year. Look there's alot of tech companies with -40 EPS floating around. It's not 2013-2018 you can't float on negative earnings and millions of users. &lt;--- the market is speaking, you have to make money as a tech company.
* **November 2024:** 
   * Rising cybersecurity risk from election, TikTok hack, etc. Fidelity even paused my money for four weeks in a CMA because they had security issues with fraud. 
   * Stock was ticking up.
* **December 4th, 2024  (Yesterday):**
   * Veeam $2B announcement mentioned earlier.
   * Volume doubles to nearly 2M. It was 700k in July 2024. It's 4M Today. Nuts.

**Where will it go?**

* It seem comparable to Zscaler and Commvault in valuation. I'm long on it and believe it'll push past $100 by July 2025.",128,99,1733455631.0,2024-12-06T03:27:11+00:00,t3_1h7s0om,wallstreetbets

If this leads to a bear market, would a total US stock index fund be a bad place to be.  Wouldn't a utility or consumer products index fund be a safer bet?

The company seems solid, especially with its strength in enterprise solutions and cloud infrastructure, even though consumer PC sales have been an ongoing problem.

They also stand to benefit from SMCI’s issues and Nvidia’s Blackwell GPUs pushing demand for their infrastructure.

15,DELL,Rolling forever....,"Looking for advice.  I have had several covered calls just get blown through with the recent bull market.  Usually I sell weekly CCs and I have been in what I am calling a death roll.  I have been rolling up and out as much as possible to try and keep up with the surges but now for many of these I am 6+ months out, still not even close to being at the money and the extrinsic value for many are so low because they are so deep in the money I have to go really far out in time to roll up in strike.

I have been burned in the past buying these back only to have the underlying stock crash back to earth.  My thought is just be patient, keep rolling out and up on any pull backs and be patient.

My income generation is way down because of this but I dont need to generate income and I can wait for these calls however long it takes to win. So deathroll for however long it takes?

39,DELL,Some thought from first year stock investment,"This month marks roughly the first year of my serious financial investment. The returning is satisfying.

I’d like to share some thought.

**My label**

1.Long-term investing on the product of market

[2.You](http://2.You) an Never Make Money Beyond Your Cognitive Abilities

**Important material I’ve read**

1.Youtube: How The Economic Machine Works by Ray Dalio

2.The Little Book of Common Sense Investing

3.Psycology of money

**Thought**

Part of my money is on sp500 related. Besides this, I still did some stock picking, which is I really want to share.

1.Nvdia:Never sold out, keep buying

Three reasons: 

a.I deeply believe productivity gain is the most powerful drive for economy growth(read it from How The Economic Machine Works by Ray Dalio). 

b.GenAI dramatically improves productivity.

c.Nvidia is the cornerstone of the GenAI

2.PAN:Hold 

I bought some last Dec. In March, the CEO announced the strategy change of the company, the stock dropped by 30%。This does not affect me at all since I am in this industry and their strategy is not bad.

Now the price came back even higher.

3.Tesla: Bought below 200 and then sold out after “We robot” event. I was disappointed on the bland event

We all know what is going on now. LOL

4.Crowdstrike:

Sold out after outage.

**I really don’t understand it.. How come the stock price of company with this huge mistake still came back. The customers still believe in the reliability of the company product? or other competitors are so behind?**

This black swan event can dramatically affect my cognization.

5.Palantir

Seriously considered and decided not buy. Now it is 6x.

6.Micron, Dell, qualcomm

Mediumlconsidered and decided not buying it.

Since I watch news everyday, I noticed some good quarterly report and  stock gain. so want to jump in.

I don’t feel strong confidence, the drive is from its recent performance and their AI-related product, but I still feel doubt of them and don’t have strong internal acknowledge of the products.

===

This year really get me deeper understanding of my own mindset and the market

Big lessons:

When you don’t have rational confidence of a company, you are much emotionally affected by single event and the market. 

Business acumen: should’ve seriously considered Tesla before election. 

Biggest Mistake:

I still got tricked into making more transaction due to make more money mindset.",0,10,1731997145.0,2024-11-19T06:19:05+00:00,t3_1guqtl3,wallstreetbets
67,DELL,Super Micro hires new auditor to maintain Nasdaq listing; shares pop 23%,"Embattled server maker Super Micro Computer said on Monday that it’s hired BDO as its new auditor and submitted a plan to Nasdaq detailing its efforts to regain compliance with the exchange. The shares jumped 23% in extended trading.

“This is an important next step to bring our financial statements current, an effort we are pursuing with both diligence and urgency,” Super Micro CEO Charles Liang said in a statement.

Super Micro is late in filing its 2024 year-end report with the SEC, and said earlier this month that it was looking for a new accountant after its previous auditor, Ernst &amp; Young, stepped down in October. Ernst &amp; Young was new to the job, having just replaced Deloitte &amp; Touche as Super Micro’s accounting firm in March 2023.

Super Micro said it told Nasdaq that it believes it will be able to file its annual report for the year ended June 30, and quarterly report for the period ended Sept. 30. The company said it will remain listed on the Nasdaq pending the exchange’s “review of the compliance plan.”

Shares of Super Micro soared more than twentyfold over a two year period from early 2022 until their peak in March of this year. But the stock has been hammered on troubling news about its compliance with Nasdaq. Once valued at about $70 billion, the company’s market cap was at $12.6 billion at the close on Monday, following a 16% rally during regular trading.

Super Micro has been one of the primary beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence boom, due to its relationship with Nvidia. Sales last fiscal year more than doubled to $15 billion.

On Monday, Super Micro announced that it was selling products featuring Nvidia’s next-generation AI chip called Blackwell. The company competes with vendors like Dell and Hewlett Packard Enterprise in packaging up Nvidia AI chips for other companies to access.

Super Micro was added to the S&amp;P 500 in March, reflecting its rapidly growing business and then-soaring stock price. Less than two weeks after the index changes were announced, Super Micro reached its closing high of $118.81.

The troubles began within months. In August, Super Micro said it wouldn’t file its annual report with the SEC on time. Noted short seller Hindenburg Research then disclosed a short position in the company, and said in a report that it identified “fresh evidence of accounting manipulation.” The Wall Street Journal later reported that the Department of Justice was at the early stages of a probe into the company.

The month after announcing its report delay, Super Micro said it had received a notification from the Nasdaq, indicating that the delay in the filing of its annual report meant the company wasn’t in compliance with the exchange’s listing rules. Super Micro said the Nasdaq’s rules allowed the company 60 days to file its report or submit a plan to regain compliance. Based on that timeframe, the deadline was Monday.

30,DELL,Which high growth stock went higher than previous day high?,"These are high quality growth stocks that's trading higher than 13 weeks ago and higher than 52 weeks ago and have growth rate greater than 10% AND these had higher close today than previous trading day. It shows strong momentum to the upside but still we have to do our due diligence before opening new positions. My indicators on chart are as follows: Green cloud is 200 sma, Brown cloud is 50ema and the other two moving averages I have are 9/21 ema. If the price is above all the moving averages, that shows strong momentum to the up. On the bottom I have EPS (Earnings Per Share) and GPE - Price/Earnings to Growth which is also called PEG ratio. A lower PEG ratio indicates the stock is *undervalued.* An undervalued stock with high EPS ratio is good for long term hold.

18,DELL,3 years of running the wheel ,"I’m into my 3rd year of wheeling and have been outperforming the market around 3x consistently. I generally aim for 3-5% a month although have been more successful in certain months, particularly after market pullbacks. 

Account:

I’ve built my account from 150k to 1.1m over this time period, adding around 300k in deposits after shifting stock grants from my employer into my wheeling account. 

Positions:

For 2024 I’ve primarily focused on $DELL, $RDDT, and $TQQQ. I haven’t been in on Reddit since the recent gains, most of my transactions were for contracts when it was in the $50-$70 range because I believed the market cap didn’t properly reflect its potential given its place in our culture and media. I was never assigned shares during this period. 

For $TQQQ I try to be very careful when opening new positions and wait for market pullbacks before selling puts. I’ve sold puts on this ticker for the entire time period and have never been assigned. I have rolled many times and used the opportunity to buy down my strike price without a loss in premium. 

I was assigned 20 contracts of $DELL earlier in the year at $130 and the stock saw a good bit of pullback. I used this as an opportunity to sell puts for much lower strikes, like $110 and $115 to lower my cost basis, while selling calls at $125 for lower premium. Overall, this was my most uncomfortable position as my account was around 25% in $DELL. My shares were called away last Friday at a $130 call and I’ve exited the position entirely. My assignment to call assignment lasted 102 days and resulted in a return of 51k at 18.85% return on my initial put assignment.

Current:

I’m currently almost entirely in cash. I have a $115 $DELL expiring on Friday for 30 contracts. 

Future:

I’m at a bit of a loss of how to proceed. I don’t see anything that I feel is a good value currently and I prefer to wait for more certainty post election. I’m looking at $TQQQ at $65 for puts but I’m concerned about momentum of the market and want to see what happens next week. I liked Chipotle after they lost their CEO and tanked a bit but that has settled for me based on current price trends. Currently I don’t have any intuition for where I’m going to go next and that’s okay. I prefer to read various news sources for a couple hours every day, have a solid understanding of what is happening in the world, and trusting my intuition from that point. There is no clear formula to me, other than read and be as informed and dispassionate as possible. My main point here is don’t make a move unless you see a clear thesis and place to capture value. 

Final Thoughts:

I love this strategy and have learned a lot over the years. The main thing, which is mentioned in every guide (and ignored by every wheel trader initially) is only sell puts on stocks you want to own. When I started I blew away 90% (30k) of my Roth IRA riding Peloton all the way because I sold puts at the peak on a stock I didn’t really believe in. Ultimately this experience was probably worth it, I needed to take a hit to learn what I was doing. 

Another thing I’d like to mention is to not underestimate the potential value (and risk) in leveraged market indexes like $TQQQ. It’s a great way to profit greatly off the swings. If I look at my monthly performance I have several months of 20% returns and the reason was that I sold $TQQQ puts after a large pullback occurring in a solid market without any obvious concerns about the stability of the overall economy. Granted if China invades Taiwan randomly this is all blown up. If you are okay with the risk of catastrophic events, these funds are really fun to watch because they heighten the sentiments of the market and make them easier to perceive. As I mentioned, I have never been assigned on this ticker and I’ve made around 400k selling puts on it over the past 3 years. 

Lastly, make sure you are using a broker where your collateral is being held in a money market account. This is probably overlooked by a fair amount of people. If I sell puts that require collateral, on Fidelity that money is currently earning 4.31% return in the money market. The wheel is often referred to as the triple income strategy, but the higher interest rates right now make this the quadruple income strategy. 

Anyways thanks for reading, best. ",630,108,1731835403.0,2024-11-17T09:23:23+00:00,t3_1gt9wqr,thetagang

From what I’ve been seeing, their main competitor has been losing customers to them, which seems like a good sign for their future growth. Overall, the fundamentals seem solid, and the company appears to be on the right track.

69,DELL,Cisco reports fourth straight quarter of declining revenue,"Cisco reported a fourth straight quarter of declining revenue even as results topped analysts’ estimates. The stock slipped about 1% in extended trading.

Here’s how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus:

* **Earnings per share:** 91 cents adjusted vs. 87 cents expected
* **Revenue:** $13.84 billion vs. $13.77 billion expected

Cisco’s revenue dropped 6% in the quarter ended Oct. 26, from $14.7 billion a year earlier, according to a statement. Net income fell to $2.71 billion, or 68 cents per share, from $3.64 billion, or 89 cents per share, in the same quarter a year ago.

Networking revenue plunged 23% to $6.75 billion, slightly below the $6.8 billion consensus of analysts surveyed by StreetAccount.

Security revenue doubled to $2.02 billion, topping the StreetAccount consensus of $1.93 billion. Cisco’s revenue from collaboration was $1.09 billion, a bit below the $1.04 billion consensus estimate.

Chuck Robbins, Cisco’s CEO, said on a Wednesday conference call that orders from large-scale clients for artificial intelligence infrastructure exceeded $300 million in the quarter. Server makers such as Dell and HPE have also focused on sales of hardware that can help clients implement generative AI.

“We have earned more design wins and remain confident that we will exceed our target of $1 billion of AI orders this fiscal year from web-scale customers,” Robbins said.

U.S. government agencies have delayed deals with Cisco, rather than scrapping them altogether, Robbins said.

During the quarter, Cisco acquired security startups DeepFactor and Robust Intelligence.

Cisco lifted its full-year guidance to $3.60 to $3.66 in adjusted earnings per share on $55.3 billion to $56.3 billion in revenue, up from a prior forecast of $3.52 to $3.58 in EPS and $55 billion to $56.2 billion in revenue. Guidance would indicate projected revenue growth of 3.3% at the middle of the range.

Analysts expected adjusted earnings for the year of $3.58 per share on $55.89 billion in revenue.

As of Wednesday’s close, Cisco’s stock was up 17% year to date, while the S&amp;P 500 index, is up around 26% over that stretch.

70,DELL,Supermicro - hold or sell - my strategy,"Disclosure of related position: I bought Supermicro for my growth and momentum trading strategy back in January 2022 for $43.20 (split aligned $4.32) and then doubled down the 6th of September 2022 for $64.22 (split aligned $6.422). Then I partially sold 15th May 2023 at 137.19 (split aligned 13.719), 10th of January 2024 at  $355 (split aligned $35.5) and 12th of September 2024 at $442.13 (split aligned $44.231).

I took out already much more than I did put in, but still own a large position of SMCI. Now I'm in the process of changing the rule for a complete selling in my strategy. As you can see in my disclosure I left a lot of money on the table which already made me change the way I take partial gains.

But let's speak about Supermicro here. What happened:

Hindenburg took a short position and published a report about bookkeeping fraud at Supermicro. Then the auditor, Ernst &amp; Young, resigned. The company is now behind on the mandatory reports to the SEC two quarters. This weekend is the deadline for a de-listing on the NASDAQ. The stock tanked 82% from the high. According to the actual published numbers (which may be corrected) the stock is now almost as cheap as when I bought it first, even if the value more than quadrupled still after the loss of 82%.

Now, Hindenburg at first only cited ex employees as source. But the resignation of Ernst &amp; Young as auditor was probably an ace in Hindenburgs sleeve. I personally know Ernst &amp; Young, they are not exactly my favorites. Since they published the report there was a mass of bad news published, the exact same analysts that hived Supermicro to the SP500 more or less exactly at the high say now it is junk after that loss.

I was thinking about Apple. In the time it would have been most profitable to buy everybody shouted sell. The stock lost more than once 80% of its market value.

Supermicro owns a lot of very unique patents. Their liquid cooled systems take less time to build and are more modular than any of the other competitors systems, Dell being its main competitor. Even if they reported some orders too early as sale they sell a lot lot more than a few years ago thanks to AI. And they will probably sell a lot more.

I think it is very possible that we cannot trade Supermicro on the Nasdaq next week. An that means it will fall out of the SP500 and the NASDAQ 100, putting a lot of sell pressure on the ETF that mirror those indices. Or, Supermicro presents a new auditor and a plan to deliver the reports to the SEC by this weekend.

It is probably a binary bet that will be resolved soon. In my opinion the upside (probability to win multiplied with amount to win) is much higher than the downside (probability to lose multiplied with amount to lose). And even if it is delisted, it is far away from being worthless. Probably it will be a target for Dell.

Here a [chart of Apple](https://www.tradingview.com/x/SDXjHW8c/) when it made most sense to hold them and when they lost a lot.",39,88,1731495213.0,2024-11-13T10:53:33+00:00,t3_1gqa9ht,stocks
40,DELL,My views on why NVDA beats earnings and flies to higher supports. Likley past 200. ,"For the PE bitchers and moaners, I leave you this:

AMD Trailing Twelve Month ACTUAL PE is: 126  

NVDA Trailing Twelve Month ACTUAL PE is: 69 


Chanos bitched and moaned all the way to the broke house where he had to close shop. Tesla preaching and evangelizing the PE did him an apostate. He's done. TESLA CRUSHED HIM. Tesla easily slid into it's PE and Chanos is no more. Same thing happened with the bitchers and moaners with Amazon, Google, etc. When a company is a quality company and especially part of the SP500, where every iteration of that index HAS TO PURCHASE this stock, you ride well, and the company easily slides well into it's PE very well and snuggly like. 

Just like Zuckerberg sucker punched Open AI LLM's by making it's LLM open source and scorching the Earth, So goes NVDA: Open sourcing their DATA CENTER TECH, ( a little secret, its not just about the GPU, it's the entire package, it's not just about BLACKWELL GPU. But Rack/ Data Center Tech Design and Architecture, there will BE ZERO INCENTIVE FOR CUSTOMERS TO GO TO COMPETITORS WHEN RACK ARCHITECTURE THAT FITS BLACKWELL GPU's with ZERO ISSUE, IS COMPLETELY OUT IN THE OPEN: READ SUMMARY( this is why AMD and INTEL are having such a hard time competing and frankly anybody else, unless you're DELL and WORKING with Jensen... But Dell doesn't make chips, so their good bros and compliment each other very well in many ways, STILL NVDA HAS IT'S OWN DATA CENTER RACK TECHNOLOGY THAT IS NOT DELL'S AND IT IS NOW OPEN SOURCE- FROM COOLING TO ETHERNET AND SCALING DATA TECHNOLOGY... GIVING THEM A MASSIVE ADVANTAGE.. vs those that want to take away their Data Center Service / Business :

This OCP summit with this open sourcing debut specifically for Blackwell tech was as of last month, Oct 17th.

( Jensen is busy busy busy )  
""At this year’s OCP Global Summit, NVIDIA will be sharing key portions of the NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 system’s electro-mechanical design with the OCP community — including the rack architecture, compute and switch tray mechanicals, liquid-cooling and thermal environment specifications, and NVIDIA NVLink™ cable cartridge volumetrics—to support higher compute density and networking bandwidth.""

Crazy AI nuclear growth, is not what the market is expecting.

They think Amazon will overtake a 30 year CUDA industry software environment the entire world/industry has created THEIR ENTIRE INFRASTRUCTURE, BOTH SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE AROUND). Go look up CUDA. It's older than many traders here. There is no world, or dimension, in the slightest, where a newcomer, or an online retailer, will wrap up 30yrs in a qtr or two. Or three, or four... NVDA continues to climb on growth, steady healthy growth, not insane nuclear growth. THAT WILL PROPEL THIS STOCK HIGHER. It has no where else to go. Ive's and Wedbush, are ENTIRELY correct.

With ALL of 2025 being an advertisement year before the debut. Will we have actual testers with heavy hitter results as soon as first qtr of 2025? Will Jensen decide to release BEFORE Sept 2025?..

 I think all of 2025 NVDA CPU will be marketed to Kingdom come and anticipation brought to the brim, and that will be felt emotionally and in the actual stock price for this freak of nature NVDA CPU chip. Another knock out sucker punch to AMD and INTC QCOM and others. Moving into their end user market as well now. ; ) Recap: For regular end user like you and me CPU: Latest we'll have it physically in our laps in a laptop or on our desktop Sept of 2025. Meaning all of 2025 will be marketed to kingdom come before it's release in Sept 2025. And the full level CPU release by March 2026. So... yeah... AMD and INTEL have a lot to worry about. And as far as I know, Biden or Trump won't block sales of regular computer pc windows chips to China or anywhere else for that matter. :)

Imagine being the king of accelerated compute and now you have a cpu + gpu combo ARM chip that runs silent like Apple M chips and sips low power like such, but games and does AI and any heavy compute intense task very wicked like, very retail level computer chip level like that is specifically from the box ready to work with cuda and marry with existing nvidia gpu's at the hyperscaler level to even more efficiently run AI intense software and on prem (on the laptop or pc itself without cloud compute help, like QCOM snapdragon Elite PC boasts it can do(but sucks, incompatible with lots of software and games, not so with nvda). People will hunt down a windows PC that has both* NVDA* gpu AND CPU* chips. Here is the link for more info=

""Not just that, but NVIDIA is also cooking up its new GeForce RTX 50 series ""Blackwell"" desktop graphics cards, and its new GeForce RTX 50 Laptop series ""Blackwell"" mobile GPUs, which will end up being featured inside of these new AI PCs with an NVIDIA + MediaTek CPU based on the Arm architecture.""

""NVIDIA has also previously said that RTX is the ""Premium"" AI PC platform, and that CPUs and SoCs launching with new NPUs (Neural Processing Units for AI workloads) are for ""Basic"" AI PCs. The company is right, as a decent discrete GeForce RTX GPU can blow away any NPU inside of any CPU now, and for years to come.""

""The new silicon will support advanced technologies, and will be mass-produced on TSMC's new 3nm process node, and will compete against Apple's new M4 chip, and Qualcomm's Snapdragon X processors.""

""NVIDIA is aiming for high-end segment with its first consumer CPU, expected in 2025
NVIDIA and MediaTek's upcoming AI PC processor is expected to enter the high-end market in September 2025, with a wider release 'expected in March 2026'.""

""However, you'd think it would lean heavily on Nvidia's graphics technology. Ultimately, you'd expect it to offer the best graphics performance on the market."" DAMN STRAIGHT. 

""The implication** with this new PC chip for 2025 is that it may well (It WILL, no 'may' it will) debut a new* in-house CPU core design from Nvidia. It would certainly be far more interesting if it did. (it will)That would also enable Nvidia to offer something much more performant than Arm's own CPU core designs.""
aaand = 

""And make no mistake, the Arm instruction set allows for some very high performance CPU cores these days. By some measures, Apple's latest CPU cores in the M4 have 60% better IPC (or performance per clock cycle) than anything Intel or AMD currently offer.""

And these cpu chips to come out officially in September 2025, but anouncement dates and getting market ready will start first half of 2025, likely this ER starts talking about it or beginning of next year... Commercial anouncement will be THE FIRST HALF OF 2025 or first qtr of 2025 yr proper... but you never know, Jensen might pull an early bird push this into the EARLY first half of 2025... Very likely Jensen talks about these babies in this coming CC next Friday?, we'll see. But it's happening either way. And market will value and trade NVDA accordingly. Millions of PC's with NVDA CPU's, as far as I can remember Biden cant block normal PC chips for normal computers to China or anywhere else for that matter.

**Ticker:** $IONQ  
**Industry:** Computer Hardware  
**Current Price:** $16.35

A month ago, I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1g3rx6h/ionq_will_experience_a_massive_rally_and_has/) about IonQ, and since then, the stock has rallied from $10 to $16. Today, the company is holding its earnings call after hours, and I expect a positive reaction in the stock price, followed by consolidation before a potential higher move later this year. Coined as the Nickelback of DD, I made a few nickels on this trade.

I won’t dive into the tech behind quantum or why it’s game-changing, but from an investment perspective, the time to position is now (though ideally, it was 6 months ago). I believe FOMO is about to kick in.

All the technical slides and key info are publicly available on IonQ’s investor website, PowerPoints, corporate presentations, and interviews with management over the years.

# Sources I recommend:

* Shawn Kwon: A Korean YouTuber who traveled to the States to [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YldqcQ35NlQ) IonQ’s management. He recently posted an insightful [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OezQl80rloU) with them.
* Peter Chapman: IonQ’s CEO has had some interviews that are really hyping me up. In a [recent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSVRPDrI8aI) one, he discusses how quantum is gaining commercial traction, especially due to having the right product at the right time, solving AI's growing energy needs.
* Forbes Interview on Quantum AI: Forbes recently [covered](https://www.forbes.com/sites/torconstantino/2024/10/02/is-quantum-computing-an-unlikely-answer-to-ais-looming-energy-crisis/) the role of quantum AI in addressing AI's energy demands, with IonQ revealing that they're launching a quantum-AI chip prototype in the coming months aimed at reducing power consumption.
* IonQ's Technical Roadmap: IonQ is ahead by 1 year on its ambitious [roadmap](https://ionq.com/resources/ionq-technology-and-performance-updates-milestones-commercial-advantage?utm_source=x&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=Q2-2024-webinar&amp;utm_content=webinar&amp;utm_term=45474) and consistently overdelivers, which gives me even more confidence in their future progress.

# Revenue Growth and Business Progress

After all, this is what we’re all here for. IonQ has consistently grown its revenue quarter over quarter. I heard Chapman mention that Q3 and Q4 are expected to be their strongest quarters, so I’m expecting a double beat today as well.

https://preview.redd.it/5wcagdfyxazd1.png?width=1979&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb8b94b8151b001a4926163c7c79e7b1d6f5ea55

This is their roadmap based on the qubits they plan to achieve. They’ve mentioned that they expect to gain a commercial advantage starting in 2026, but after today, good results could lead to forward pricing.

Qubits, like bits in classical computers, determine the computational power of quantum computers. In quantum computing, qubits scale exponentially in potential, as each additional qubit doubles the system's computational capacity. This is because a quantum system with multiple qubits can represent a superposition of all possible combinations of the qubit states, making quantum systems exponentially more powerful with each added qubit.

Bottom line: For a more powerful system, revenue is expected to scale exponentially as well, unlocking more applications that were previously unattainable.

https://preview.redd.it/blkjixeayazd1.png?width=1440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1fcc97293e73bded17a2447ba82232142133eca0

Just two days ago, their latest [system](https://status.ionq.co/), **Forte**, became accessible on their cloud. This will likely drive more revenue, as anyone can now test their systems through IonQ’s cloud or other major cloud providers.

https://preview.redd.it/jrla5dymzazd1.png?width=916&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d75c3e90390ded079954b4eb76be0ba50484289

With hyperscalers now planning to literally build nuclear reactors to power their data centers, I believe this is the perfect moment to introduce a new kind of computing product to the market. All made in the USA.

# Business Applications

I’ve heard a lot of people say that applications are at least 10 years away, and value creation will take 10-15 years. But I disagree with that perspective.

This is their landing page on quantum [applications](https://ionq.com/applications-services), and it looks solid. They’re focusing on areas that Nvidia is also targeting right now: digital twins, hybrid computing, and machine learning. Many of their staff come from top companies like Nvidia, Amazon, and Dell.

https://preview.redd.it/asslamcuuazd1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a18728c7dbfa500838c003f7e6fe1ec449d02abe

Recently, they’ve posted some interesting job openings: one for **Quantum AI** and the other for **Quantum Applications Chemistry**, both for scientist positions.

https://preview.redd.it/plbtkkamtazd1.png?width=917&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78a67ea32c71e9e122de2f29c3ad126ccba93f78

https://preview.redd.it/syiuz5ertazd1.png?width=901&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b26d7531a88554803c333a0f28f51fcfca52cf1

It seems like they’re ready to develop apps for customers right away. As mentioned in the previous post, **today** they will showcase their first application, presumably focused on the healthcare industry. Personally, I think it will be related to pharma, especially since they’ve partnered with Quantum Basel in Switzerland to provide quantum access to nearby organizations.

The good thing is that after today, investors will immediately know whether this showcased app is something of value or not. We’ll find out if it’s commercially viable and applicable to the industry or just a prototype far from commercialization. Either way, it's better to clarify this quickly.

# Options Chain

I’m sharing this to highlight that institutions are taking an interest, not to promote options gambling. In recent months, IonQ’s chain has shifted from being sh\*tty to balanced. This is the chain for the 2026 LEAPS. The OTM $35 strikes have attracted significant attention over the past few weeks, going from no open interest to 3k contracts for a $3B company since late summer.

https://preview.redd.it/ln9ryu8duazd1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0da88dfcb6c3b7d26615e06abf5dc9d97c59973

# Institutional and Government Interest

In a recent interview on [CNBC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78JiA4ealks), Amy Raslin discussed why her fund went long on IonQ. This decision came after the stock rallied from $10 to $14 just a week ago.

Additionally, Congressman Glenn Ivey [spoke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E27cYheKQHE) with Bloomberg and Peter Chapman about the growing support for IonQ.

# Competitors

For those saying that Dell or Microsoft are leading the way in quantum hardware, they don’t know what they’re talking about.

IonQ has the highest gate fidelity and error correction in the industry, along with the largest contracts from government institutions like ARLIS. The White House has even highlighted IonQ’s efforts to scale up their manufacturing facility in Bothell as part of their ""[Investing in America](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Washington-IIA-State-Fact-Sheet.pdf)"" agenda.

# Bear Thesis

The bear thesis, largely pushed by day traders these days, focuses on technical analysis charts and claims that IonQ is overbought. A few years ago, Scorpion Capital published a short report, which was promptly [responded](https://ionq.com/posts/may-12-2022-ionq-founders-respond) to by the founders. Since then, no large short positions have emerged with a solid thesis against IonQ. It's a bet against the technology and IonQ's ability to commercialize it.

Bears often argue that IonQ is expensive based on valuation metrics and negative EPS. This argument makes no sense since they’re just starting out and went public before generating revenue.

But this is exactly the moment to make a decision in my opinion: do you believe IonQ will continue to execute its roadmap? If so, do you enter now, before the revenue starts to come in and the price catches up to projections, or do you wait until the stock is trading at higher multiples but miss the current $16 entry point?

I think that a lot of the bearish articles are laughable, especially when they keep repeating that quantum is ""10 years away."" Beyond timing and valuation, no other real bear arguments seem to make it into the debate.

# Founders

I’ve seen some people argue that the founders leaving IonQ to continue their research signals that the ship is sinking and is an obvious short sell. However, the reality is that the founders didn't leave because the company is failing; they transitioned to focus on their academic work after 20 years of research. The company is now in the hands of a commercial and specialized quantum team focused on scaling up the commercialization efforts.

It all started 20 years ago in a lab in Maryland, when an investor approached the founders after reading their paper in a journal. That investor proposed creating a company based on their groundbreaking technology, and here we are today.

# Conclusion

That said, the run on the stock is far from over. It will last for years, with investors cashing out at various price levels along the way. I have no idea what will be said during earnings or what we can expect from the application that is to be showcased, but I’m eagerly waiting to find out.",67,63,1730910245.0,2024-11-06T16:24:05+00:00,t3_1gl2dp1,wallstreetbets
71,DELL,Super Micro Computer- SMCI $26 - Avoid Till We Get Restated Financials,"**I think Super Micro Computer, (SMCI) should be avoided for the following reasons:**

**Restatements could alter the financials significantly:** The odds are high that the company will end up restating past financials. The Auditor’s resignation, its CEO’s pay package, and its past settlement with the SEC in 2018 all suggest that SMCI will have to restate its financial statements.

**No 10K:** SMCI has delayed its annual 10-K filing and without an audited 10K, we have precious little faith in the numbers. 

**SMCI has priors:** This was not their first time. In 2018, the company settled charges with the [SEC for improper accounting](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2020-190). As stated in the article from the SEC website….

&gt;

**Tainted:** To me the alleged malfeasance creates significant doubts for investors that will not go away for a while, and it's very likely that Wall Street will not touch it, fearing liability for not doing enough due diligence. Also, I can’t imagine SMCI getting a decent multiple in the future for the same reasons until faith is restored in management and its books.

**Possible Loan Default:**  There is a significant risk of Super Micro defaulting on the company's Term Loan Agreement with Bank of America. 

**Compensation tied to aggressive revenue targets**: The CEO’s unusual compensation package, with virtually no base salary and bonuses tied to very aggressive revenue and share price targets, is a dangerous and potentially abusive practice.

**Possible delisting from the Nasdaq, and getting thrown out of the S&amp;P 500**: The chances of both are high as a new auditor needs to be found, and a substantial amount of restatement work needs to be done.

**A great business:** Sure, SMCI has a great server liquid cooling business, which has tremendous potential and demand for server racks for AI GPUs, right now and for the foreseeable future. However, as we saw Nvidia has already started shifting this business.

**Ignore the low valuation:** I’m going to ignore the current low valuation of 8x earnings and 0.5x sales, which are much lower than competitors such as Dell (DELL) and Oracle (ORCL), simply because I have no idea what the restated financials will look like, and the valuation could be a lot different

The only way I would invest is the possibility of a merger/acquisition/White Knight, that will keep the stock afloat. The CEO owns close to 10% of the company so I doubt if he would let this go without a fight.

The other problem I foresee is the difficulty of getting good and timely information. For the most part, we rely on analysts who expect a proper set of books. Instead of focusing on the fundamentals, we’ll be spending far too much time, and worse without success trying to figure out what is genuine or not, It would make better sense to invest in other GPU/semiconductor businesses.

TL;DR: We're entering an unprecedented technological acceleration where AI capabilities are advancing exponentially. Companies see this, and will spend whatever it takes to build AGI. This creates a generational investment opportunity, particularly in two key areas: foundation model companies and datacenter infrastructure plays. I'm deploying \~$100K with this thesis. I'd love your thoughts on this, and am looking to incorporate feedback.

**The Thesis:**

We are witnessing the early stages of perhaps the most significant technological revolution in human history. The evidence suggests we're approaching an inflection point in artificial intelligence that will reshape the entire economy. Here's why this matters for investors:

**Key Technical Developments:**

* Transformer architecture has fundamentally solved previous algorithmic and data constraints
* Larger models consistently demonstrate superior capabilities
* Critical breakthrough in reasoning capabilities (building on techniques from game theory/poker)
* Major capability jumps expected with upcoming models (GPT-5, Gemini-2)

Business Implications:

1. The Prize: Human intelligence and agency have historically been the greatest constraints on economic growth. AGI would effectively remove these constraints.
2. Follow the Money:
   * Current AI capex spending at big tech companies is &gt;$150B annually
   * For comparison: The tech bubble peak saw $250B/year in broadband infrastructure in today’s dollars
   * Unlike the tech bubble, today's AI investments are being made by cash-rich tech giants with fortress balance sheets
   * Training next-gen models will require hundreds of billions in compute investment
3. The Economics Are Compelling:
   * Leading tech companies each generate $100B+ in annual revenue
   * They can invest off their balance sheet with extremely low cost of debt
   * Early evidence shows strong ROI on AI investments (e.g., Microsoft/OpenAI revenue growth)

  
**Investment Strategy:** I'm deploying $100K across foundation model companies and datacenter infrastructure, with a small allocation to energy. Here's the detailed breakdown:

[Overall Portfolio](https://preview.redd.it/9atytvnu6lxd1.png?width=1900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9da96520090f2e014f5f1bd82af30eb67c1a8fca)

* Foundation Model Companies (50%): Based on comprehensive benchmarking data from [LiveBench.ai](http://LiveBench.ai), weighted by demonstrated capabilities across reasoning, coding, mathematics, data analysis, language, and instruction following:

   1. Google (Gemini-1.5-Pro): 11.77% 
   2. Microsoft (OpenAI Partnership): 10.66% 
   3. Amazon/Google (Anthropic Investment): 9.79%
   4. Meta (LLaMA): 9.49% 
   5. Tesla (xAI): 8.30% 
* Datacenter Infrastructure (42%): Weighted according to typical datacenter capital expenditure breakdown:

   1. Servers/Compute: 31.47% Primary exposure through NVDA
   2. Networking: 4.53% Split across CSCO, ANET, JNPR
   3. Construction &amp; Components: 5.99% Including:
      * XLI ETF: Exposure to industrials that will be involved in building these datacenters
* Energy Infrastructure (7.33%):
   1. XLU ETF: Exposure to utilities that will power this buildout
   2. This is based off datacenter variable (energy + colo) costs being approx 15% of the monthly cost of the datacenter, with the remaining being the capital costs of standing up the datacenter.

  


 **An interesting catalyst for why I think now is the time to buy into this:**

There's going to be some foundation models that will be released over the next few months that will reconfirm the returns to scale for these models. [\[1\]](https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/24/24278999/openai-plans-orion-ai-model-release-december)[\[2\] ](https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/25/24279600/google-next-gemini-ai-model-openai-december) The truly exciting thing is that these models will be able to take actions to do tasks on your computer. The main issue in the current iteration of models is that they are not reliably able to do long running goal oriented tasks, but the release of o1 changed my perspective on this problem. That model has been trained to go through chain-of-thought steps to get to the right answer, and its data will be used to train larger models on the entire reasoning sequence. This unlocks a whole bunch of learnable training data. Things are going to get even more exciting.   
I've been working on language models since GPT-1/BERT/etc, and the main thing is that every time a model comes out, we're all surprised at how much better it gets. I've learned to not be as skeptical of the returns to scale, and I'm finally putting (more) of my money where my mouth is. ",33,18,1730161157.0,2024-10-29T00:19:17+00:00,t3_1gehmif,wallstreetbets

44,DELL,Is Dell Heading for a Collapse? Michael Dell’s Billion-Dollar Cash-Out While the Company Crumbles,"Hey WallStreetBets, 

Longtime lurker and APE here, and as an **AMC long-time stockholder;** I’m clearly in it for the long run and have a knack for investing in companies whose **stock falls quickly and stays down**. So, naturally, as an investor in Dell, I am bracing myself. I want to raise some red flags about Dell that are starting to feel like much bigger issues than just bad customer service. My experience with Dell has been a nightmare, and after looking into the massive uptick in consumer complaints, it seems like things are spiraling. This could have serious implications for the stock, so here’s the breakdown:

# The Personal Nightmare

I’ve been dealing with Dell’s customer service, and they’ve completely dropped the ball. They’ve failed at basic things like:

* **Repairing hardware** that’s still under warranty.
* Violating Dell's TOS and sending boxes with **incorrect shipping labels**, causing delays and confusion.
* **Losing track of hardware** when it’s sent back for repairs.
* Failing to provide clear instructions or **basic customer support**.

And I’m not alone. There’s been a huge rise in **consumer complaints** across **review sites** and **government agencies**. This isn’t just an isolated incident—it’s a trend, and it’s pointing to much deeper problems at Dell.

# Dell's Business Is Collapsing from Within

The issues go beyond customer service failures and speak to **fundamental problems** with Dell's strategy and leadership:

* **Michael Dell’s $1.24 billion stock sell-off**: He’s cashing out, possibly leaving other shareholders holding the bag while the company can’t manage even the basics.
* **Losing Top Talent to Forced RTO**: Dell’s **Return to Office (RTO) policies** are causing massive internal problems. They’re losing top talent who don’t want to go back to the office, leading to **brain drain** and weakening their innovation and management teams.
* **Layoffs**: On top of RTO, they’ve had **waves of layoffs**, which further destabilizes the company. With fewer people to handle critical operations, quality is falling off a cliff.
* **Pivoting to AI That Doesn’t Work**: Dell is trying to pivot to **AI solutions**, but it’s clear that their AI systems are **not functioning** as intended. Instead of helping, they’re replacing human workers with tech that **can’t deliver**, causing even more service issues.

# Why This Is a Warning Sign for Investors

Let’s break it down:

* **Customer service failures** are a huge problem for any tech company, but for Dell, whose core business relies on repeat enterprise customers and warranty renewals, these failures are fatal.
* Michael Dell cashing out his **$1.24 billion** could be a sign he’s bailing while he still can, leaving shareholders stuck with a company that **can’t handle the basics**—and that’s a huge red flag.
* **Top talent leaving** due to RTO mandates means Dell’s internal innovation and management are suffering. Losing your best people in a tech company is a death sentence.
* **Layoffs** and pivoting to **dysfunctional AI** solutions are compounding the problem. Dell’s core business is eroding while they chase tech that isn’t delivering results.
* If Dell can’t manage simple **customer complaints**, track their own products, or provide reliable **repair services**, how long before that trickles up to bigger issues like product rollouts, innovation, or handling enterprise clients?
* **Increased government complaints** are another canary in the coal mine. More people are reporting issues to **consumer protection agencies**, and that’s not going to sit well with regulators or institutional investors who are paying attention.

# Is Dell’s House of Cards About to Collapse?

Michael Dell seems to be **gutting the company**. They’re not meeting basic expectations for repairs or customer service. If Dell can’t handle the fundamentals, what does that mean for their **long-term viability**?

* With **Michael Dell’s massive stock cash-out**, it looks like he’s cashing in before the ship sinks, leaving other shareholders with the fallout.
* **Top talent is leaving**, they’re pushing **ineffective AI**, and the company's infrastructure is cracking. Dell’s entire business model feels like a **house of cards**, and it’s wobbling.
* This could mean serious problems for **shareholders** in the near future. If Dell’s reputation tanks, their **stock price** could take a nosedive, especially if larger institutional investors start pulling out after these growing complaints.

# Investor Relations Response Pending

I’ve already reached out to **Dell’s Investor Relations** to raise my concerns as a shareholder, but I’m still **waiting on a response**. If they don’t address these serious issues, it could be a huge red flag for anyone holding Dell stock. Right now, it feels like Michael Dell is cashing in while leaving the rest of the shareholders with a company that can’t even manage basic customer service and repairs.

# What Should I Do as a Shareholder?

As a current shareholder, I’m wondering what steps I should take. Should I be preparing to get out, or is this just a rough patch that Dell might recover from? If any of you have experience with similar situations or thoughts on the direction of Dell, I’d really appreciate your insight.

# What Does This Mean for Investors?

Is this a **long-term play** to short Dell as the cracks start to show? Or is Dell about to hit a wall because they can’t manage the very basics of their business? Either way, it’s looking like Michael Dell is **cashing out** while the rest of us are left holding the bag.

Curious to hear your thoughts, WSB—are we looking at a **serious decline** for Dell, or is this a temporary blip? What’s your take on **Michael Dell’s billion-dollar cash-out**, **RTO fallout**, and **AI pivot failures**?",0,45,1729009679.0,2024-10-15T16:27:59+00:00,t3_1g4btxw,wallstreetbets

4,DELL,(9/17) - Tuesday's Pre-Market News &amp; Stock Movers,"#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to the new trading day and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Tuesday, September the 17th, 2024-

# [Stock futures rise as Wall Street awaits retail sales data, Fed policy meeting: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/16/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures rose Tuesday as Wall Street readied for key retail sales data and the start of the Federal Reserve’s September policy meeting.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the S&amp;P 500 added 0.4%, while Nasdaq-100 futures gained 0.6%. Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 131 points, or 0.3%.
*****
&gt; Microsoft rose 2% after the tech giant hiked its quarterly dividend by 10.7% to 83 cents per share. The company also approved a $60 billion buyback program.
*****
&gt; Intel shares popped about 7% in premarket trading after the company said it plans to make its foundry business a subsidiary. The Biden administration also awarded the company up to $3 billion in funding through the Chips Act.
*****
&gt; Investors on Tuesday will parse retail sales data for August for one final glimpse into the health of the U.S. consumer ahead of the Fed rate decision. Economists polled by Dow Jones are bracing for a 0.2% decline. Excluding autos, they see a 0.2% gain. The results could affect the rate cut outcome.
*****
&gt; Wall Street is on standby for the Fed’s long-anticipated rate cut, a move that could help boost earnings growth for companies following a backdrop of steep borrowing costs and high inflation. The Fed first embarked on its aggressive hiking campaign in March 2022.
*****
&gt; While Wall Street expects a cut Wednesday, the market is divided on the size of the potential reduction. Traders are currently pricing in a 67% chance that the central bank eases rates by 50 basis points, according to CME Group’s Fed Watch tool. That’s up from a roughly 47% chance Friday.
*****
&gt; “Market expectations are split between a 25 basis point and a 50 basis point rate cut, as the decision is complicated by conflicting signals of solid economic activity but a weakening labor market,” said Principal Asset Management’s Seema Shah. “Rarely have market expectations been so torn, so close to a [Federal Open Market Committee] meeting.”
*****
&gt; While a 50 basis point cut isn’t out of the question, the chief global strategist thinks that the Fed should take a more cautious approach to cutting and ease rates by 25 basis points. She is forecasting additional 25 basis point cuts in November and December.
*****
&gt; Wall Street is coming off a mixed trading session. The 30-stock Dow rose more than 228 points, or 0.55%, to close at a record high, while the S&amp;P 500 added 0.13%. The Nasdaq Composite lost 0.52% as Apple and prominent chip stocks declined.

46,DELL,🚀 Unleash the Power of AI with Core Scientific (CORZ) – The Next Big Thing! 🚀,"🚀🚀🚀  🚀🚀🚀

Listen up, apes! 🦍 It’s time to talk about Core Scientific (CORZ). This stock is about to go to the moon, and here’s why you should be loading up your bags:

**Crypto Mining Powerhouse**: Core Scientific is one of the largest blockchain infrastructure and hosting providers in North America. With Bitcoin and other cryptos on the rise, CORZ is perfectly positioned to capitalize. More mining = more $$$.

**AI and Data Centers**: Core Scientific is not just about crypto anymore. They’ve shifted to AI data centers, targeting a $30 billion valuation. They’re providing high-performance computing (HPC) services and have contracts to deliver massive infrastructure for AI operations. This diversification is a game-changer. Plus, they’ve inked a $3.5 billion deal with CoreWeave to provide 500MW of hosting capacity for AI operations. This partnership is a massive boost, positioning CORZ as a leader in AI infrastructure.

**Traditional Data Centers vs. Bitcoin Miners**: Traditional data centers typically trade at multiples of 10-15x EBITDA, while Bitcoin miners often trade at lower multiples, around 5-8x EBITDA. However, with the shift towards AI and HPC, CORZ is poised to command higher multiples similar to traditional data centers. This transition could significantly re-rate the stock, making it an even more attractive investment.

**Strong Financials**: The company has been showing solid revenue growth and improving margins. They’re not just surviving; they’re thriving. This is a company that’s built to last.

**Market Sentiment**: The sentiment around CORZ is heating up. More chatter, more interest, more FOMO. Don’t be the one left holding the bag when this rocket takes off.

**Insider Buying**: When the big dogs are buying, you know something’s up. Insiders have loaded up on $1.90M worth of CORZ stock. They know the company’s potential and are putting their money where their mouth is.

**Technical Analysis**: The charts are looking bullish. CORZ has broken through key resistance levels and is showing strong upward momentum. The moving averages are aligning for a golden cross, signaling a potential long-term uptrend.

**Political Landscape**: Regardless of the candidate, the political landscape is very focused on AI and AI infrastructure. This bipartisan support ensures continued investment and growth in the sector, further solidifying CORZ’s position as a leader in AI infrastructure.

**Upcoming Catalysts**: Keep an eye out for upcoming earnings reports and potential new partnerships. Any positive news could send this stock soaring even higher.

**Bullish CEO Statement**: As Adam Sullivan, CEO of Core Scientific, stated, “Our new contracts with CoreWeave position us to transform our hosting business and our earnings power by capturing exciting growth opportunities in AI compute, one of today’s most dynamic technology segments, while also maintaining our strong bitcoin mining franchise”.

**Bullish Quote from Michael Dell**: Michael Dell, CEO of Dell Technologies, emphasized the transformative potential of AI, stating, “AI is the rocket fuel for the next era of innovation. The infrastructure we build today will be the foundation for the breakthroughs of tomorrow”.

**Bullish Quote from Jensen Huang**: As Jensen Huang, CEO of NVIDIA, said, “AI is the most powerful technology force of our time.”",5,12,1726230803.0,2024-09-13T12:33:23+00:00,t3_1fftl99,wallstreetbets

17,DELL,ATM Calendar + Call &amp; Put - W Shape Structure Earning's Winner?,"Quick recap ran a ""reverse double diagonal"", which is actually called a diagonal iron condor apparently. It's an iron condor opened on the day of earning's when IV is disproportionately high, because the dates are staggered with the long legs a month out, becomes a *diagonal iron condor*, aka diagonal spread because it's playing difference in price *and time* now, still an Iron Condor structure.

Someone commented creating W shaped structure, if understood the comment correctly, it can be an ATM calendar/diagonal, mixed with call and put with a month+ till expiration to dodge some of the IV crush it looks like this:

&amp;#x200B;

[W Structure](https://preview.redd.it/mbqxc9ngo4md1.png?width=327&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6dd5e2b11600bc1a9c5c1344f9e2f6f8c0d52bd4)

If the price trades flat, the ATM calendar profits substantially covering the loss from IV crush on call/put, if the price runs the call or put can capture substantial gains. With month till expiration, IV crush will affect the short leg selling the week of earning's drastically but affect the long legs much less. The disproportionate IV skew is how make profit here.

&amp;#x200B;

[ATM Calendar + Call &amp; Put](https://preview.redd.it/1qhxak2xo4md1.png?width=300&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47d27db72b65c25d0903fb24af8740d5976bcbd9)

This is interesting because there's certain companies which are too volatile to comfortably play diagonal iron condor. Mag 7, other big behemoth companies have 5-10% suggested implied moves on earning's, diagonal iron condor shouldn't get blown out. However, volatile tickers with 15%+ earning's suggested implied move, this approach can capture potential big move without getting blown out to IV crush.

**CONCLUSION:** The enemy and ally is IV crush so It's best to look at the volume of the short leg, ideally selling on the day of earning's when IV is highest, *ensuring the long legs a month out do not have much IV expansion*. For Dell, my short legs had 145% IV when sold, the long legs had 61% IV. However, if long legs had 90%+ IV it would be much harder to profit. Idk what this strat is called it just seems like a safe approach to earning's for certain companies. I really like this idea along with diagonal iron condor which worked amazing on Dell, have much testing to begin.",12,11,1725166816.0,2024-09-01T05:00:16+00:00,t3_1f66mz1,options
18,DELL,Dell Reverse Double Diagonal Actually Worked!,"So this is something new, said I was done playing earning's and earning's really do suck, but was doing good with double calendars and had built upon the idea which has today unexpectedly fruited the best results I've ever seen from an earning's play.

1. It's a reverse double diagonal opened on the day of earning's
2. Captures high IV premium, pays less for long legs.
3. Literally both sides profited even though price action moved against one side. I've never seen this happen before, *both sides profitable even though price action worked against one side*.

I may have found my earning's strategy literally the day after being in the valley of despair. It's necessary for the company to report Thursday after-hours for this to work best, so Friday expiration and IV crush can take out the short legs as much as possible. This is how I set it up.

* I sold the $116 (8/30), purchased the $119 call (10/4), this creates a potential backspread loss of $300, but I receive more premium from short legs and pay less for long legs being further OTM. Repeated this process for $101/$104. So short legs were placed 5% out from the current price.
* To avoid getting ran through set another set at $120/$123 and $100/$97. So these short legs were placed 10% out from the current price, or what was the suggested Dell implied move.

In the morning immediately went to close, three of the plays were nicely in profit, the $100/$97 was the only one which presented just an 8% loss. If held until 1pm the positions would've been substantially more profitable as short legs finished decaying premium.

**CONCLUSION**: I cannot believe I played through IV crush and had price action move against the downside positions, yet the $101/$104 was still in-profit! The way this is opened as a backspread to receive more premium, covering half the implied move (5%) and the actual implied move (10%), with long legs having a month of time it somehow avoided most the IV crush, and actually profited from the IV crush! This did not work with NVDA or CRWD because price traded flat, but more-so my strikes were placed at 16% or way too far out! Should've done 5%/10% and both would've been profitable too!

49,DELL,SMCI - this is far from over,"SMCI has some nice niche products, but SMCI’s margins are tiny because they offer nothing proprietary.  
I have a feeling that they were on a roll, but the management couldn't quite keep up with success and the stock went up too high in valuation believing the company internally could keep up with the pressure.

For a company which has no moat, has shrinking margins and is again encompassed in accounting problems, I don't see an upside. I can understand that mistakes happen, but this is becoming a pattern recidivist behavior, and in my book, the trust is seriously shaken, if not lost.

I can understand skepticism around Hindenburg report, but withholding the release of annual report (10-K) is a big no no. Some jumped to SMCI's defense that they did so because of Hindenburg report to make double-checks, but why would you need to double-check a report which was previously audited by independent party (EY) and is supposed to be ready for submitting weeks ahead of deadline?  
For those that aren't aware, 10-K is a kind of report that contains comprehensive overview of company's financial performance over the past fiscal year, but also includes audited financial statements, unlike quarter reports which are less detailed and are unaudited ([link to 10-Q](https://app.quotemedia.com/data/downloadFiling?webmasterId=90423&amp;ref=318292688&amp;type=HTML&amp;symbol=SMCI&amp;cdn=f006c6d17a8677ce2f9e8b184a14bbb0&amp;companyName=Super+Micro+Computer+Inc.&amp;formType=10-Q&amp;formDescription=General+form+for+quarterly+reports+under+Section+13+or+15%28d%29&amp;dateFiled=2024-05-06)). 10-K also includes discussion and analysis (MD&amp;A), risk factors, organizational structure, executive compensation, subsidiaries, and more.

Moreover, there are reports that buyers (such as CoreWeave, Tesla, Amazon AWS, Digital Ocean, to name a few) are switching to competition (which has higher margins), and from being the top customer, to having Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang publicly endorsing their competiton ([“Nobody is better at building end-to-end systems of very large scale for the enterprise than Dell.”](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dell-escapes-nvidia-shadow-own-133820520.html)),one has to ask - what is really going on?

I believe that, at least partially, the reason lies in that (to quote [mod from SCMI subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/SMCI_Stock/comments/1emlh0s/comment/lklblb9/?context=3)) *SMCI was very cheap in 2022 and 2023 when the circumstances were different. Nobody knew about their success back then, which allowed them to avoid competition and actually increase sales and margins.*  
*Now is a different story: they are at diseconomies of scale and diluting shareholders to finance their operations. I wouldn’t be surprised to see SMCI drop to the 300s or lower and never recover because they are just a commodity company now.*  
Dell, HPE and Lenovo aren't resting and have joined the server building market in the meantime.

Institutions which haven't closed their positions already will have a hard time explaining why they kept their position when this stocks sinks even more.

Even insiders believe in everything so much, that the insider net stock purchases in last 12 months amount to 0. One would think that they would grab stocks with hands over fist with this ""great discount"", but I guess they don't want more shares.

Buybacks? With increased CAPEX and lower margins, the need for money for R&amp;D, and with history of dilutions, I'd be more concerned of further dilutions.

To top it all of, in all these commotions, some of you might have missed a little interesting detail. On August 15, 2024 SMCI added Susie Giordano to it's board of directors. ([Link](https://ir.supermicro.com/governance/board-of-directors/person-details/default.aspx?ItemId=ce4d4770-623d-4e66-a6c9-2679d0c68221))  
Her background is law, and *Ms. Giordano has over 25 years of experience advising executive management and board directors on a wide range of topics, including strategy,* ***litigation, compliance, regulatory matters, corporate governance***, ESG, executive compensation, ***financial reporting, crisis management***\*, cybersecurity, human capital management, ***investor relations***, M&amp;A, ***securities, shareholder engagement, and treasury matters***.  
To me, this is very peculiar timing. She gets appointed to board of directors just mere (12) days before Hindenburg reveals their report and before we find out about 10-K delay, indicating that there could be undisclosed problems and SMCI management is/was aware of it. Where there's smoke, there's fire.

With all that said, I am very bearish on this stock and will be buying long puts.

TL;DR: SMCI is a total dumpster fire - no moat, shrinking margins, losing big clients, and can't even get their 10-K out. Insiders aren't touching the stock, and now they're bringing in a lawyer - betting on this sinking ship with puts all day!",38,33,1725030021.0,2024-08-30T15:00:21+00:00,t3_1f4xep2,wallstreetbets

73,DELL,"Dell beats estimates as server sales soar 80%, riding AI wave ","Dell reported quarterly results on Thursday that beat Wall Street expectations, powered by an 80% increase in server sales. The stock rose more than 5% in extended trading.

Here’s how the company did for the fiscal second quarter vs. LSEG consensus estimates:

Revenue: $25.06 billion vs. $24.53 billion expected

EPS: $1.89 adjusted, vs. $1.71 expected

Net income climbed 85% to $841 million, or $1.17 per share, from $455 million, or 63 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Revenue increased about 9% from $22.93 billion a year ago.

Dell typically provides investors with a forecast on its analyst call. Earlier this year, the company told investors to expect revenue between $93.5 billion and $97.5 billion for the full year, up from $88.4 billion in the prior year.

Dell has emerged as a top vendor for servers that can handle artificial intelligence workloads, especially those based around Nvidia chips, as demand skyrockets from cloud providers. Earlier this year, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang called out Dell founder Michael Dell as the person to contact to place orders for systems that include the company’s new chips.

Dell shares are up 48% so far this year, but have slumped 34% since the company’s last report.

AI sales are in the company’s Infrastructure Solutions Group, which makes servers and systems for data centers. It’s the company’s fastest-growing unit. Overall ISG sales rose 38% to $11.65 billion, ahead of StreetAccount expectations of $10.44 billion.

The standout in Dell’s report was Servers and Networking revenue, which includes both AI-oriented servers based around GPUs from Nvidia and AMD, as well as more traditional servers for older applications. It’s part of ISG.

The unit reported $7.76 billion in sales, rising 80% on an annual basis, and beating StreetAccount expectations of $6.37 billion. Dell said $3.1 billion of that was AI server sales, up from $1.7 billion in the May quarter.

Dell operating chief Jeff Clarke attributed the increase in revenue to server demand that continues to rise, and said in a statement that there was an increasing “backlog” of $3.8 billion in AI server orders that haven’t been fulfilled yet. There’s also a multibillion-dollar “pipeline” of AI server deals from enterprises and cloud providers that haven’t been finalized.

However, Dell’s storage business, also part of ISG, fell 5% to $4 billion in sales.

Dell’s Client Solutions Group, which focuses on PCs and laptops, declined 4% on an annual basis to $12.41 billion in revenue. Consumer sales fell 22% to $1.86 billion, and the company’s enterprise PC business was flat at $10.55 billion in sales.

Dell said that it spent $1 billion in the quarter on share repurchases and dividends.

51,DELL,Reasons why SMCI is the Next NVIDIA,"
As you all know SMCI was once at 1200 six months ago, but because smart money in a bid to make profit sold their shares to retail traders all the way down to 400 …putting their profits in lame stocks that are yes outperforming the market …but those stocks aren’t SMCI.

Of course us retail traders on Reddit know more than these institutions. We also know it isn’t our fault we kept buying all the way down leaving many with a cost basis of $800. It’s their fault for wanting to put their money in better performing names.

Guess what though SMCI is the next Nvidia. They will regret the day they sold out of a company with profit margin pressures that loses customers to Dell and HPE. 

What makes SMCI the next NVDA…900 points. 

Yes SMCI may not have any propriety tech or moat, and yes they may not be the only server builder with liquid cooled servers, and yes they no longer get first dibs at NVDA GPU’s… but did those other companies stock go up 900 points in 3 months! The answer is NO…they did not. And that is why SMCI is the next NVDA. Sure it doesn’t innovate any IP and has a difficult time maintaining profit margins and keeping customers, but it did go up 900 points.

To hell with the smart money knowing more about fundamentals than the Reddit community. 

We know something they don’t and that is #900points3months",0,27,1724872605.0,2024-08-28T19:16:45+00:00,t3_1f3iq6u,wallstreetbets

...For the full fiscal year 2024, Super Micro (SMCI) raised its revenue guidance to $14.7B-$15.1B from a previous outlook of $14.3B-$14.7B...

I'm sure you could debate if they would claim that this is all AI server related. However, If they are inflating thier numbers by 50 to 75% that would be bad for the evaluation of the entire AI server market.  

Dell

Yes, I know there are other companies out there that make AI HW like Lenovo. I'm just saying that the sales that these trendy companies are receiving from AI HW specifically is about on par with what SMCI is claiming on thier reports related to AI.

53,DELL,S&amp;P 500 Additions Sept. 6 ,"The S&amp;P is rebalanced four times a year. Two weeks before the rebalancing, they announce which companies will be added and removed from the index. The next rebalancing occurs on Sept. 20, which means they will announce the additions and deletions to the index on Sept. 6 after the market close.

S&amp;P rebalancing is one of my favorite trades because it has asymmetric risk-reward. If the stock is added to the index, it usually goes up 5-10%. If it isn't added, it usually only goes down 1-3%. I've made a small fortune in the past with this technique by successfully predicting the additions of Palo Alto, Blackstone, and Crowdstrike.

The S&amp;P 500 selection committee does have some requirements for a stock to join the index. Generally speaking, the company needs to be profitable for four quarters and have a minimum market cap of 18 billion. The full list of requirements is here on pages 7-12 of the PDF file. [https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/methodologies/methodology-sp-us-indices.pdf](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/methodologies/methodology-sp-us-indices.pdf)

Here is list of potential candidates based on market cap: 

NOTE: Some of these are not profitable and therefore ineligible for S&amp;P500 inclusion. This is not a comprehensive list, there are dozens of potential companies. Do your own DD.  

Apollo Global

Palantir

Workday

Doordash

Ares

Datadog

Applovin

Snowflake (unlikely because of stock volatility)

Cheniere

Tradedesk

Square/Block

Dell (maybe a float issue? Otherwise, I am unsure why it hasn't been added yet)

Veeva

PINS

Vertiv

Hubpot

Carlisle

Cloudflare



Here are a list of companies that are ineligible companies to save you some time:

Roblox (negative EPS)

Atlassian (neg trailing EPS)

Coinbase (neg trailing EPS)

Arm (ADR)

CRH (Not eligible until next rebalancing)

My theory: The last few additions to the S&amp;P 500 have been a humiliation for S&amp;P. Crowdstrike had a massive outage and SMCI is being exposed as a fraud.

Top gainers:
DELL Calls when it was under $100 (+$167k)
NVDA Calls during recent dip (+$167k)
NKE Calls when it was under $75 (+$166k)
a space stock (bought around $5.50 sold at $7) (+$112k)

EXPE (bought in Feb expecting future olympics to boost it) (-$25k)
PANW calls when it first fell under $330 (Pelosi fomo) (-$15k)

Story:
In 2018/2019 I was inspired by a regard posting $500k account he made by trading CHGG.
Started Robinhood in 2019 with $70k (total life savings) and made it $40k by the end of year.
Funny story, I misunderstood that impeachment meant removal of president and yoloed into volatility etf and poof 50% loss.
Started SPY calls in 2020 and the account became $15k when COVID was first announced. Closed all positions. Withdrew whatever was left.
Started in 2021 fresh with $40k deposit, made it to $75k on TSLA calls. Then made the biggest bad decision in my entire life to yolo that into far OTM BB leaps expiring in 2022 and 2023. Poof all gone.



Did not trade in 2022 and early 2023.
Became interested because I saw regards posting gains mid 2023.
I had $50k in 401k with a previous employer. Rolled that over to an IRA and started trading.
Made it $180k by 2024 (only stocks)
Enabled options in 2024 and made to $1M

Good luck to you regards!

56,DELL,"The AI Bubble is over, and Nvidia are going to eat shit on earnings","## Why is AI a bubble?

Before any of this will make sense you have to understand that our current approach to AI does not work and never will. I'm not saying AI is impossible and that we'll never build it, but the GPT/ML approach was a known dead end for decades in academic research. We didn't need modern technology to figure that out, you can do it with a slide rule and many did. All we're seeing now is what came of a bunch of idiot VCs deciding to try anyway, some of it is genuinely impressive but for the $400 billion that's went into it it's still catastrophically disappointing.

The business case for AI is dead simple: ""Hey there Manager, hiring staff is an expensive pain in the ass right? What if we made a computer that did their job for a tiny fraction of the price and always said yes?"". Think about the mindset of the C-suite and upper management of any major company. They didn't work their way up, they don't have professional expertise in whatever it is their company actually does. They're the accountants and lawyers who say things like ""just make it work"" and ""do more with less"". AI as promised is their dream, they can fire all their staff and never have to think about physical reality again, they think they'll be able to tell GPT 7.0 ""just make it work"" and it'll be so gosh dang smart that it can.

It's neat that OpenAI and a few other companies have built vaguely serviceable chatbots, it's neat that Midjourney can spit out cool pictures, but it's embarrassingly short of what investors were promised. Ford's executive team doesn't want to replace 40% of it's level 1 customer support team with ChatGPT, it wants to be able to end a board meeting by saying ""FordGPT, please design and start manufacturing next year's F150 model, make sure it's available in the usual colours plus moss green"" and it'll _just do it_. They don't want a search assistant, they want J.A.R.V.I.S.

And GPT/ML can't do that, no matter how many GPUs you throw at it.

## Why now?

A ground rule for machine learning is ""exponential investment for linear gains"". That means exponential increases in training time, in compute, in training data, in storage, in power. Neither the world nor the economy is infinite and many of these are bumping into both of those.

* [They're running out of training data](https://apnews.com/article/ai-artificial-intelligence-training-data-running-out-9676145bac0d30ecce1513c20561b87d). Llama 3 and GPT 4o's input training data is a 2-digit percentage of ""all words ever written by humans"".
* [They're running out of power](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/03/07/ai-data-centers-power/).
* [They're running out of money](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/openai-training-and-inference-costs-could-reach-7bn-for-2024-ai-startup-set-to-lose-5bn-report/).
* ML-focused GPUs aren't seeing that much generation-to-generation improvement in terms of cost/power efficiency.

But most of all the investment levels are getting so high that even [major financial institutions](https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/goldman-sachs-exchanges/a-skeptical-look-at-ai-investment) are starting to feel uneasy. Remember they don't want a search assistant, they want Jarvis, and as we enter year 9 of ""the next version will finally be it, trust me bro"" with stagnating improvement and not a single financially viable product to show for it, they want to see more results before signing off on the next trillion dollars in capex.

## Why Nvidia?

Nvidia's importance within the AI ecosystem is grossly overstated. Their work on CUDA opening up GPUs for general-purpose computing tasks deserves a lot of credit for starting the broader machine learning gold rush, but that was a decade ago now. Today none of the software to train or run AI models is beholden to Nvidia's hardware. All of Microsoft's recent datacentre expansion has used [AMD Instinct cards, not Nvidia](https://www.amd.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-5-21-amd-instinct-mi300x-accelerators-power-microsoft-a.html). Microsoft are [already developing their own chips in-house](https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/ai/in-house-chips-silicon-to-service-to-meet-ai-demand/), as are [Meta](https://www.reuters.com/technology/meta-deploy-in-house-custom-chips-this-year-power-ai-drive-memo-2024-02-01/), and both [Google](https://cloud.google.com/tpu?hl=en) and [Amazon](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/trainium/) have had their own deployed for years. Nvidia is merely a chip _designer_, not a manufacturer. They can design and market all the chips they want but the sector has grown large enough that it's a no-brainer for the real tech giants to vertically integrate.

The expectation is Blackwell selling faster than they can manufacture them for the next 2 years, the way Hopper has for the previous 2 years. Even if Blackwell is as big of an improvement over Hopper as promised ([which it probably isn't](https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/graphics-cards/fresh-rumours-claim-nvidias-next-gen-blackwell-cards-wont-have-a-wider-memory-bus-or-more-vramapart-from-the-rtx-5090/)), and even if the delays aren't indicative of serious manufacturing problems with TSMC's 3nm process ([which it probably is](https://www.techpowerup.com/314452/samsung-and-tsmc-reportedly-struggling-with-3-nm-yields)), it's hard to see a winning formula.

Nvidia is a sound business long term, they've got a well-deserved dominant position in several markets, but their current valuation is based on future revenue estimates that not even the most bullish AI future could possibly deliver. With the confluence of so many factors, I think this is the quarter where the penny finally drops.

## Are we in for a broader tech crash?

Personally, I think not. The tech bubbles that most of you will be familiar with are the financial ones comprised of shitty unprofitable startups that IPO and inevitably explode some time later. AI is more of a _tech_ bubble where its just the new hot thing tech bros are obsessed with. Rather, it's 40% of the new product development budget at the blue-chip tech giants. It's a waste of money that will no doubt result in corrections at some point, but that money mostly came from the revenue of existing profitable products. It was wasted on some stupid bullshit before, and it'll be wasted on some new stupid bullshit after.

The real hit in the medium term will be to ""shovel sellers"". Nvidia, AMD, TSMC, Equinix, Dell, HP, Supermicro, etc. Any company for whom those capex numbers are a considerable source of revenue.

## tl;dr

ML/GPT-based AI is dumb, institutional investors have noticed, Nvidia's chips aren't special anymore, and tech giants are vertically integrating chip design anyway.",0,146,1724607819.0,2024-08-25T17:43:39+00:00,t3_1f125zr,wallstreetbets

57,DELL,Non-space and NVDA earnings for next week 8/26,"$DELL, $DG, $BBY

With the way retail and value retail has been going I have confidence in both $DG and $BBY 8/30c. $TJX, $PFGC, $TGT, $WMT, and $COST all printed this month. They seemed obvious but everything next week seems a lot more dubious. I am skeptical on $DELL due to their reliance on $INTC and was thinking of opening positions both ways on them. They seem undervalued currently but I'm not sure if recent news is priced in or not.

$CRM, $ADSK also release next week. I don't know a ton about these but they do seem marginally undervalued. 8/30c Contracts seem pricey but doable. For reference my background is in retail and logistics. 

Honorable mentions for next week but don't have 8/30 in their options chain are $VSCO, $BMO, $FIVE, $FLWS. I really like $FIVE but I'm not sure if they've had a busy enough year so far to open any 9/20 positions.

24,DELL,My ITM Covered Call Scanner - WIP,"Thanks to all the commenters so far who've helped point out the fairly obvious calculation errors I've been making in previously deleted posts where I was asking for feedback about my strategy and approach.

I do believe I have the values correct now though!

So the gist of it, is that, with a little more effort, you can get a higher ROR than a CSP by buying the shares outright, and then immediately selling an ITM call against those shares.

If the stock breaches your short call, you keep the shares and begin to incur losses if larger drawdowns occur. If the stock goes up, your shares are called away, and you keep the premium, ready to find another trade to enter.

From doing some quick math, an ITM CC usually nets you about 20% higher return on risk than a CSP. As someone who doesn't have access to portfolio margin on Robinhood, an ITM CC is also attractive to me since I can use margin to purchase the shares, this type of leverage isn't available when selling CSPs.

Here's the output after scanning all the tech stocks.

60,DELL,SMCI BAG HOLDERS ASSEMBLE,"ATTENTION SMCI PEEPS

We need to speak up and meet in person at the SMCI headquarters and have a talk with Charles. Basically he needs to fix this. The earnings call could have gone a lot better if he just fudged the numbers a little bit. Why did he have to be so literal and kill the vibe. 

Sometimes the truth is not the best course of action…sometimes a CEO needs to be creative and say the business isn’t f’d from competition by other companies. To hell with HPE and Dell. Outside of them offering more services like cloud backup and customer support, they can’t even hold a candle to SMCI which once traded at $1200 without any IP or moat whatsoever. 

Charles needs us and our opinions. Maybe if we explain to him nicely that the stock needs to be at 1200 so many of us can break even, he will understand our plight. 

My suggestion is that he puts out a video and retracts some of his previous statements about margin  pressure. Just say “oh I totally messed up these numbers. We actually are at 14% profit not 11%. Doug the assistant made a typo when handing me the GAAP numbers. Not to worry we laid him off. So that frees up another 80k for CAPEX from Doug’s salary.” Or something along those lines. Maybe he can get all his work buddies together as well and buy some company stock to boost it from the inside. 

Anyone have any other suggestions? 

Also, Iif anyone knows Nancy Pelosi or has a way to get a hold of her maybe we can explain our situation in hopes she buys some options or shares in SMCI. That will get it to 1200 in a weeks time. ",6,16,1723161653.0,2024-08-09T00:00:53+00:00,t3_1enldhz,wallstreetbets
76,DELL,DELL. Another INTC?,"DELL seems to have gotten some of the fiercest devaluation (except for INTC) the last month. Similar to Intel, they're now terminating tons of jobs to clean up their expenses and get leaner looking forward. 

Is this a genuine restructuring and pivot to their AI business or is this a panic measure similar to INTC because they're hemorrhaging funds and need to cut their losses somewhere? 

Where do you stand on DELL? They're getting bloodied right now, but overall they've been doing well and have grown significantly over the last year. Is it all AI hype? 

Personally I think DELL, like all major AI tech stocks will face this correction in the short term and grow significantly in value in the years to come as the AI race actually takes off and consumer AI products become more and more commonplace.

AI great! But it is still years away from the euphoria that’s expected.   

Bottom line - show excitement to come into the office or factory and make things happen.  

Heads are rolling, and the land slide is just beginning.  Expect a poor unemployment rate tomorrow.  Y’all be begging for a chance at Wendy’s.  
  
No soft landing!  A rocket that’ll crash a crater thru the planet Earth.  Tell me I’m wrong.  ",0,39,1723089127.0,2024-08-08T03:52:07+00:00,t3_1emw8ln,wallstreetbets
20,DELL,Sold Put On Dell Exercised,"I sold a put on Dell at 129 that was exercised last week. Since then, the stock has been a falling knife. I am a buy and hold investor, so I don’t mind holding it for a while until it rebounds, but it is a larger position than I would like in my portfolio. It is currently trading at 87.10. Long puts are expensive and there is little money in selling calls in the near term. Any recommendations on a strategy to hedge this over the next couple of months until things improve? It’s a drag on my portfolio. 

Thanks! ",0,10,1723067279.0,2024-08-07T21:47:59+00:00,t3_1emoewo,options
34,DELL,Help buying my first stock.,"
I have saved 4K this year and want to buy my first stocks. Now seems like a good time since the correction. A friend of mine that works in finance recommended Nvidia, Dell and TSM. I like the chip stocks and will definitely be buying Nvidia and Dell. Probably TSM as well.  However, I really want to buy Raytheon. With all the recent news it seems like a good idea to invest in the military stocks. Is Raytheon a good buy for long term growth? Or do people just own it for a high dividend? Could you see Raytheon growing more in the next 10 years than any of the Stocks I mentioned. 

PS: My next 1k will be going towards Amazon. ",29,58,1723046212.0,2024-08-07T15:56:52+00:00,t3_1emfibl,StockMarket
26,DELL,Dell and MU Stocks,"I have put credit spread on Dell at 110 and Micron at 95, both expiring on 23 Aug 24. 

With the market downturn on Monday and falling together with SMCI ... it is deep ITM

My plan is to wait close to expiration and roll if it is still ITM. 

May I ask what are your thoughts on these 2 stocks? They are not the best but they do benefit from AI infrastructures and servers expansion. ",6,14,1722987080.0,2024-08-06T23:31:20+00:00,t3_1elwp0x,thetagang

77,DELL,Microsoft shares drop as cloud miss overshadows better-than-expected revenue,"Microsoft shares fell 7% in extended trading on Tuesday after the software company reported disappointing cloud revenue, overshadowing stronger earnings and revenue than analysts had predicted.

Here’s how the company did, compared with the LSEG consensus:

Earnings per share: $2.95 vs. $2.93 expected

Revenue: $64.73 billion vs. $64.39 billion expected

Microsoft’s revenue increased 15% year over year in the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended on June 30, according to a statement. Net income, at $22.04 billion, was up from $20.08 billion, or $2.69 per share, in the year-ago quarter.

Revenue from Azure and other cloud services grew 29% during the quarter. Analysts polled by CNBC and StreetAccount had expected 31% growth. Microsoft doesn’t disclose revenue from the category in dollars. Last week Google parent Alphabet said revenue from its cloud business, encompassing Workspace productivity software and Google Cloud Platform infrastructure, went up by about 29%. 

During the fiscal fourth quarter, Microsoft started selling Surface PCs with AI features that can run certain models locally without the need for an internet connection. Dell, HP and other device makers also touted their own so-called Copilot+ PCs. CEO Satya Nadella said at a press briefing in May that “we’re bringing real joy and a sense of wonder back to creation on the PC.”

27,DELL,Rolling Puts after Earnings IV Crush (DELL),"I have wrote some DELL puts that expire on 8/30. Earnings is on 8/29. There are three likely outcomes between now and then: 1) stock rallies into earnings (technical analysis suggest a 9% rally over the next 20 days — that gets up to around 125ish prior to earnings), 2) range bound, or 3) weakens down toward the $106/108 support area.

I originally wrote weekly $137s and $134s. When the stock collapsed, I started rolling down and out for credit — small, but positive nonetheless. I can typically roll $1-2 down and out every week. I’m actually holding $127s and $131s now that expire in 8/30.

If options rapidly degrade rapidly after earning due to IV crush, what does that do to the ability to try to roll puts down and out? What is my best strategy knowing that I will likely need to roll down and out over the several months. I prefer to operate on the put side and not own the stock outright.

63,DELL,"SMCI: Attractive Valuation, Great Potential","**POST-EARNINGS UPDATE:**

SMCI just delivered very disappointing Q4 results as gross margin (11.2% v 15.5%) and EPS (6.25 v 8.1) fell short of the lower bound of their previous update. The problem with FCF has also become severe.

Although their revenue guidance is still optimistic, **I no longer buy their EPS prediction**. Therefore, I need to acknowledge that my prior understanding of this company is wrong.

**I now downgrade my rating of this stock, from overweight to underweight. The price target is adjusted from 1050 to 600.**

**The earnings, on the other side, confirm that NVDA has a very strong quarter.**

**Original Post:**

AI frenzy is unfinished, yet the broader market suffered from a significant retreat this week. The PHLX Semiconductor Index dipped 6.86% on Wednesday, the worst performance since the pandemic. NVDA barely holds the 118 level, while other stocks such as MU, QCOM, AMAT, LRCX, ASML, etc., have dipped below key price levels. They are seeking support on MA120 (or at an even lower price).

I am paying attention to **SMCI**, a stock that may be less focused these days. SMCI lost more than 12% this week and closed at a price below 800. However, this dip has offered unique opportunities, reducing its post-earning risks, and making the price very attractive. Here is my analysis.

0. My Position:

**18 SMCI 01/17/2025 1200 C, 6 bought this Wednesday and Thursday at an average price of 71.6. My average cost is now 110. Although I have suffered a loss of 35%, I am sure that this is just temporary.**

1. Valuation:

**SMCI is trading at a PE TTM of 44.63 and a 1-yr forward PE of 22.17**. This is a very attractive price given its growth this year and the year to come. As a comparison, DELL is trading at a 1-yr forward PE of 16.17, with its growth much slower than that of SMCI.

SMCI is offering the market its unique stack-scale liquid-cooling system that can customized. With the surging demand for liquid cooling for AI server applications (especially the application of the NVDA B series), I expect SMCI to expand its portion in the AI server market while maintaining its current gross margin. The fundamentals of the corp are solid and I see great visibility in its future performance.

2. Technical:

SMCI is trading at a support level of 760-805 which is ultrastrong, which marks the dividing line between the bullish and bearish momentum. We can see that this level has been tested multiple times in the past 2 months, while strong buying has supported the stock in this range. All MAs (up to MA120) have converged, indicating the bottom consolidation to come to an end.

Besides, **the current price is only 7% higher than the closing price of the previous earnings call, while its peers in the semiconductor industry have surged by more than 20% (e.g., 25% for NVDA).** This indicates that the market may have digested the possible scenario of the stock failing to deliver results that are good enough. This risk-off emotion will help relieve some post-earning risks.

3. The broader semiconductor industry:

ASML delivered very good Q2 results, with a &lt;2% miss on its revenue guidance for Q3. TSM just delivered a blockbusting earnings report that beat the top and bottom lines on both quarterly performance and guidance. This indicates that chipmakers such as NVDA are having a very good season with demands surging even more than before. **This indicates that SMCI is also having a very great season where I expect its revenue and EPS to beat its bar which has far exceeded the market consensus**.

4. Rating:

**I now initiate an 'Outperform' rating for SMCI. The 12-month price target is set to be 1050, which indicates a potential upside of about 35%.**

The expected forward valuation is about 30, somewhat larger than its peers simply because of its growth.",13,24,1721431931.0,2024-07-19T23:32:11+00:00,t3_1e7hquw,wallstreetbets

24,DELL,Need Advice on Deep In-The-Money Puts Expiring in 3 Days,"Hi r/options,

I could use some advice on my current situation. I sold 13 cash-covered $141 DELL puts for $3.70 each last week and they expire in 3 days. Unfortunately, the stock price has dropped to $131, making these puts deep in-the-money.

Here's some context:

- Premium Received: $4,810 (13 contracts * $3.70 * 100)

My Situation:

- No Additional Funds: I don't have extra funds to manage this position beyond the cash set aside for the assignment.

Options I'm Considering:

- Hold to Expiration:

Likely scenario is getting assigned, buying 1,300 shares at $141 each.
Effective purchase price after premium would be $137.30 per share.
Concern: Significant paper loss if the stock remains at $131.

- Rolling the Position:

Buy back the current puts and sell new ones with a later expiration.
Potential to collect additional premium and extend the time for stock recovery.
Concern: High cost to close current position and uncertainty of new premiums covering it.

- Accept Assignment and Sell Covered Calls:

If assigned, sell covered calls to generate additional income.
Potential to mitigate losses and benefit if the stock price recovers.
Concern: Stock might continue to decline, adding more risk.

Questions:

Should I hold to expiration and prepare for assignment?

Is rolling the position a viable strategy given the current deep in-the-money status?

What are the best practices for selling covered calls post-assignment in this situation?

Any advice or insights from those with more experience would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance!

18,DELL,My view on the language model value chain.,"Hi, I am a founder who is trying to build ""Google for Financial Research"" start out from equity research.

  
Today, I'd like to share my thoughts on how the past few years has been for AI, the current status, and finally the future. I do not know everything but wish to learn new things. So, I would love to get honest thoughts on my view --- and also my product if you're interested :)

  
### Value Chain



First, you can view the LM value chain similar to the computer value chain. 

- Foundation model providers like OpenAI and Anthropic are similar to semiconductor designers(fabless; e.g., Nvidia, Qualcomm). They design the models. Performance is everything.

- Cloud companies like Azure, AWS, and GCP are like semiconductor manufacturers(e.g., TSMC, Samsung Electronics). They provide training resources for actually making production-grade models. Cost and reliability is everything.

- Finally, newly born application companies or existing ones those who are harnessing this technology is like computer companies(e.g., Apple, Dell). They don't need to know what's under the hood, as it's abstracted. User experience is everything.

  
### Past

  
Yeah so, over the past few years. GPT. Boom! That's how it the world started to become interesting (and inflating). GPT-2 was sensational to tech guys. GPT-3 comes out, that becomes history. GPT-3.5? GPT-4. ... You get the point. 

  
OpenAI has been leading this industry ever since its emergence into the mass market. Although many competitors like Anthropic and Google has joined the league, and they also perform very well, it is OpenAI that is dominating its presence in the arena. I think Altman's plan is to make OpenAI's models to be the go-to-model for intelligent systems, and he is succeeding very well. Fyi, I am really not a big fan of Sam so don't judge me wrong.

  
### Present

  
Now, the present. As you all know, the only real winner in this market is right now Nvidia and PaaS companies. No doubt on this. All the companies building foundation models like GPT, Claude, or Mistral is falling apart. Either suffering from wrong operation(e.g., Stability) or poor financial health. The global surge of these new companies trying to construct a new tech infrastructure has only lead to those who provide 1) datasets, 2) GPU server instances, 3) actual GPUs, 4) and energy.

  
But in order for this waterfall to sustain, the foundation model providers need to actually generate profit to keep the cycle going. Unfortunately, infrastructures make money from people(or companies) trying to build applications. Well, applications ... Hmm ... As a founder who is actually building one, the truth is, the only two product that I've seen engineers applying to their systems is OpenAI's gpt-4o and Anthropic's Claude-3.5 Sonnet. Of course, there are open-source models that you can host by yourself, but that's just not essential for those who are trying to build AI applications. Even large software companies like Microsoft and Notion solely depend on gpt-4o.



So, the sad thing is that most of these FM providers will die either by financially perishing or getting acquired by larger infrastructures like AWS, Azure, and GCP.

  
### Future

I’m selling CC on it as I wait for it to come back and get called away. I’m considering selling my 100 shares and converting it to a Dell Leap with a break even at $155.  This frees up about $9k that I can go make other money with and I can still sell the same CC which theoretically return 3x based on capital invested.

25,DELL,Bullish On Dell In The Medium Term (8/2 Expiry Call Option Analysis),"*NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR*

DELL, TSM, and NVDA had a tumultuous week influenced by profit taking into OPEX resulting an interesting buy opportunity for DELL in the medium term. Dell specifically is what I was drawn to with the price approaching 200 MA. The 200 MA shows the bullish sentiment on Semiconductors and Dell carries well with NVDA at that these bullish stages. 

In general strike prices 140-160 Low Volume, Slightly Leaning Negative Delta Put Buying, High Open Interest. Seems to present a Bearish Consolidation bias. 


Plan:
Original position down on $4.50 premium currently valued at $3.50

Existing Position 7/26 @ $160 
.2843 Call Delta
104 Volume 
456 Open interest 

If negative price action occurs :
In general know that dates 6/24- 8/2 at 140 finds support on put buying sentiment slowing. Will Average down if the stock prices goes below the $141 level. Average down with 8/2 @ $150 Strike. From this position stop losses market sells are set to trigger at -10% of the premium price. 

If Consolidated Price action ensues
Open interest to Volume gaps needs to close to something closer to 1:1 to confirm bias to buy at $145 level. 

If positive price actions occurs sell the current option 1:2 or 1:3 Risk Reward. 

(Any references for how to guide risk reward ratios would be helpful. Typically setting RR intuitively based on the IV, news, and sentiment primarily gauging it from seeking alpha, yahoo finance, and Robinhood to speculate reversal or to confirm price action. 
Similarly at market close on the day long time frame I analyze the change in stock price and daily volume compared to the previous day’s close. And Volume and Open interest at different strikes. Increased option volume suggests more active trading reflecting bias towards confirmation of that days price action. Negative or neutral change to open interest implies fewer outstanding contracts that might not actively be participating in the price movement thought of as the market waiting for confirmation.

Dell Technologies and Super Micro Computer are key players in the development of xAI's supercomputer. Dell is responsible for assembling half of the server racks, while Super Micro, known for its liquid-cooling technology and strong ties with chip firms like Nvidia, will handle the other half. This collaboration was confirmed by Elon Musk on the social media platform X.

# Nvidia's Contribution

Nvidia is providing the advanced AI GPUs required for the project. The training of AI models like Grok requires tens of thousands of power-hungry chips. For instance, training the Grok 2 model took about 20,000 Nvidia H100 graphic processing units (GPUs), and future models will require even more. Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, emphasized the importance of this collaboration in expanding the reach of AI technology.

# The AI Factory

Dell CEO Michael Dell announced that the company is building an ""AI factory"" with Nvidia to power Grok. This AI factory will be a comprehensive infrastructure, including CPUs, GPUs, networking switches, software systems, and storage, all connected by miles of cables. The factory aims to make it easier for a broader range of customers to establish their own AI factories.

# Future Prospects

Elon Musk has ambitious plans for xAI. The supercomputer, termed the ""Gigafactory of Compute,"" is expected to be operational by fall 2025. This venture aims to enhance the capabilities of the Grok AI chatbot, making it a formidable competitor to existing AI models like OpenAI's ChatGPT. The project will utilize up to 100,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs, potentially making it one of the largest GPU clusters in existence.

# Conclusion

The collaboration between Dell, Super Micro, and Nvidia marks a significant milestone in the AI industry. By combining their expertise and resources, these companies are set to create a powerful supercomputer that will drive the next generation of AI technology. With the project expected to be completed by fall 2025, the future looks promising for xAI and its generative AI chatbot, Grok.

This is a long term play, and we don't know when (or if) this would happen, and that bodes well with the current entry point, as DELL was recently beaten down in earnings going from a peak of 180 to now a stable range of 130s and still have potential to grow.

71,DELL,What is stopping HPE from doubling/tripling in value this year,"Considering the main stuff holding their valuation back was they werent working with Nvidia as much as industry leaders like Dell, their actual order flow was spotty for servers and AI sales, and had iffy guidance. 

Now they already doubled Q1 profits and they haven’t even started reaping the benefits of their MSFT AI contracts or their US gov Cloud server sales. Plus working directly with Nvidia on most of their new stuff. I know anything can change daily but if the pipeline pans out why would their valuation remain 1/3 of the industry leaders if they are poised to join them on their level?

73,DELL,Can You Guess When I Started Trading Options?,"If you guessed that first peak, you are mistaken. That was a Reddit penny stock that unfortunately pumped and dumped. So after that, I had stumbled upon wallstreetbets and  learned about a more civilized form of investing called options. Things escalated quickly and before I knew it I found myself full ported into Nvidia 7dte right before GTC (March 18-24th). Somehow made it out alive and ahead going from 200k&gt;150k &gt;240k. After that, I pissed away ~40k on various options, and, naturally, decided to test my luck again and full ported on April 9th, expiring April 12th. This took me from 200k to 300k. Then, things took a turn. On April 19th, Nvidia tanked 10% due to smci decision to not release preliminary revenue (talk about abunch of bullshit). I initially told myself I should wait till end of day and then load up on calls right before close (this is my biggest regret). But I saw Nvidia had already dipped 5% that morning and I couldn’t resist and started buying calls around 25k. Every time it dipped I loaded another 25k bullet, but it just kept dipping and I kept firing. Until, finally, I was down to my last 25k bullet and bought right at close. That Friday, my account value at the end of the day fell to 97k (Ouch). Sold Monday and clawed myself back to 150k (this is what I started with when I first opened my account). Then 2 days later, I decided third times the charm, and full ported into Nvidia with 75k into 3dte and the other 75k into a Nvidia call expiring post earnings report. I sold the 3 dte for 110k and held onto the other option through earnings that was now valued at 230k. My account peaked at 383k. Inevitably, I pissed away ~50k (thanks Dell), but I now have the rest of my portfolio in Nvidia stock, like a boomer. Ending my account value around 331k today. I am done with options for the time being. I am going to buy a sauna (for the stress), some workout equipment, a mountain bike, maybe remodel my kitchen, and an espresso machine with my winnings.

78,DELL,HPE is still EXTREMELY overvalued! Avoid pt.2,"I flagged the original as a discussion cuz wanted to reply in comments... but since it was deleted here's some D

All analysts are basically in consensus on HPE's target price (which is 15% below the current price... most analysts are rather generous in the target price of companies). This is pricing in poor management and poor guidance as follows:

* earnings growth (3.4%/year) and revenue(5.6%/year) are forecasted to grow slower than the US market by a third! This indicates they haven't positioned themselves well for the AI wave and will most likely take a backseat to DELL and SMCI
* the company is horribly mismanaged with a future return on equity at 11.2%... I mean come on you're tech company that sells a box - the dream! - what are you doing with that equity? For comparison DELL is at over 100%, and SMCI is 36% - I bet you the corporate culture is toxic as hell - with directors and above just focused on making sure they look good at any cost
* it's a debt laden company with a net debt equity ratio of 46.2% and $22.6B in liabilities, which again points to horrible mismanagement probably to finance a bunch of office politik initiatives that didn't end up generating revenue, and it doesn't have sufficient assets ($20.2B) to cover their short term liabilities, they're probably praying for rate cuts, and since earnings reflect the past they're most likely to report a bunch of interest payments
* Finally Micheal Dell's salary is $3M... CEO of HP is $20M! and a VP just recently off loaded a bunch of shares ($1.2M)

So yes it's a storied company that tosses you a couple shekels in dividends, but I bet it's being mismanaged, and I doubt they capitalized on the free money during covid to do anything other than ratchet up the internal office politics and fund leadership pet projects while just giving the bare minimum amount of attention required to their cash cow ProLiant servers... which weren't even originally designed to support NVIDIA... they had to pivot over the last year to figure out how to incorporate them.",19,44,1717189423.0,2024-05-31T21:03:43+00:00,t3_1d565sm,wallstreetbets

82,DELL,Why dell stock is down after earnings report ,Dell earnings were surpassed analysts estimates and they did good but now I hope all of you know how earnings work they always look for future and the guidance for full year and next quarter weren’t looking so nice for Dell. Now it was not too much of bad guidance but with that being said the analysts now expect even lower earnings. Dell is a good company and I believe even if it fell down 18% I still think it will do good and come back up and regardless I would like to mentioned that never play with earnings like that because it’s like Russian roulette and you never know you might end up on which side anyway let’s see what’s markets brings Tommorow with the news of trump being found guilty. ,33,59,1717109100.0,2024-05-30T22:45:00+00:00,t3_1d4gkb8,stocks

* Diluted earnings per share of $1.32, up 67% year over year

Dell Technologies tumbled 13% in extended-hours trading even as the IT giant reported fiscal first-quarter results that were largely in-line with expectations.

For the period ending May 3, Dell earned an adjusted $1.27 per share on $22.24B in revenue.

Of the company's two units, Client Solutions Group generated $12B billion in revenue, flat year-over-year. Operating income for the unit was $732M. Dell's Infrastructure Solutions Group delivered $9.2B in revenue for the fourth quarter, up 22% year-over-year. Operating income was $736M.

A consensus of analysts expected the company to earn $1.29 per share on $21.65B in sales.

""We again demonstrated our ability to execute and deliver strong cash flow, with AI continuing to drive new growth,"" said Dell Chief Financial Officer Yvonne McGill in a statement.

87,DELL,My next play: Bullish on HPE earnings,"HPE is definitely the red headed step-child in the server market. However, at this point its valuation is becoming attractive.

My bullish case is:

1. They haven’t really participated in this AI rally yet like SMCI or DELL.
2. I think they finally are getting their shit together and actually bringing compelling (or at least viable) products to market. At least all of their marketing messaging seems to be all in on AI.
3. Shares and calls are cheap.
4. If Dell does well on earnings, I think HPE will also get a lift. You can play it more risky by getting in today, or safer by getting in after Dell ER.

So, I’m just hoping for the “me too” effect here next ER mostly.

Position: 200 $20c for 6/7 and 200 $20c for 9/20.

96,DELL,"$MDTKF (MediaTek): Collaborating with Nvidia for 3nm Arm ""AI"" Chip Supremacy","There have been rumors about MediaTek and Nvidia joining forces to develop a 3nm Arm “AI” PC chip based on Arm technology (Dan Nystedt on Twitter). 

MediaTek will likely provide the system-on-chip (combining all the components into one chip). It seems that their share on this will be significant and can be a seriously huge income for MediaTek. 

The interesting thing is.. Yesterday, Dell (one of the OEM’s) was literally teasing next to Jensen (ceo of Nvidia) that they are coming with an AI cpu next year.. (confirming the rumors essentially)

Fuck the AI snakeoil buzzwords, but essentially we know already that the arm architecture has proven superior in battery life and performance, as seen in the MacBook Pro M chips compared to older Intel models. Windows is being redesigned for ARM and this is a huge market in the following years. 

Leakers speculate at a reveal at Computex Taipei 2024 which starts the 4th of June, but Nvidia will already do a keynote the 2nd of June. 

Let’s talk numbers. MediaTek currently has a market cap of $59.55 billion and a P/E ratio of just 22.3. It’s cheapo compared to novideo, ayymd and incel. 

Price is up (although not as much as competitors) last 6 months but I think this is not fully priced in. 

Also, free AI hype bonus: Everyone is going to go crazy if the company manages to ride the AI wave, considering Nvidia's tendency to generate massive hype. 

**Beginning of june (2nd - 7th) is going to be wild. Keep an eye on this one.**",14,11,1716457633.0,2024-05-23T09:47:13+00:00,t3_1cyoyhv,wallstreetbets
97,DELL,Nvidia: Dell teams with Nvidia to offer new Blackwell GPUs in AI push,"Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) said on Monday it is working with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) to offer the semiconductor company's latest Blackwell GPUs in its servers amid the artificial intelligence boom.



Dell's new PowerEdge XE9680L server comes with direct liquid cooling and sports eight Nvidia Blackwell Tensor Core GPUs. GPUs are increasingly power data centers — in favor of the more traditional CPUs created by Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD) and others — as they are better capable of handling for AI workloads.



""Organizations are moving quickly to capture the AI opportunity, which is why our collaboration with NVIDIA is so important,"" Dell founder and Chief Executive Officer Michael Dell said in a statement. ""Our expansion of the Dell AI Factory with NVIDIA continues our joint mission – we're making it easy for organizations to implement AI so they can move boldly into this next technological revolution.""



""Generative AI requires a new type of computing infrastructure – an AI factory that produces intelligence,"" Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang added. ""Together, NVIDIA and Dell are providing the world's industries with a full-stack offering – including computing, networking and software – that drives the copilots, coding assistants, virtual customer service agents and industrial digital twins of the digital enterprise.""



Dell and Nvidia are also working on the Dell AI Factory in an effort to speed AI adoption and innovation, the two companies said in the statement.



Nvidia announced its new Blackwell line of GPUs in March, receiving much acclaim from Wall Street.



Separately on Monday, Dell announced that it would be working with Microsoft (MSFT) to offer new AI-powered PCs running on Qualcomm (QCOM) processors.",54,13,1716296263.0,2024-05-21T12:57:43+00:00,t3_1cx79nx,wallstreetbets
84,DELL,Microsoft announces new PCs with AI chips from Qualcomm ,"Microsoft is touting new computers with advanced chips designed to run artificial intelligence features of software for Windows, without quickly using up battery life.

The company on Monday announced Surface Laptop and a Surface Pro tablet with a Qualcomm chip that can run some AI tasks without an internet connection. Other computer makers like Lenovo, Dell, HP, Asus, Acer and Samsung are also launching AI-ready PCs powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus processors, which promise longer battery life and will run Microsoft’s Copilot AI chatbot.

The computers adhere to Microsoft’s new Copilot+ standard that feature a minimum amount of performance, storage and memory. Copilot+ PCs with AMD and Intel chips will follow, Microsoft said during a press keynote on its campus in Redmond, Washington. The PCs will be able to translate audio, recommend responses to incoming messages and suggest changes in the Settings app, and even talk with people about what’s on screen.

Copilot+ PCs will start at $999. Microsoft is accepting pre-orders as of Monday, and the devices will become available in June.

A Recall feature will be able to search through a log of previous actions on PCs. Recall relies on AI models that run directly on the device, so it can run offline, and an index of the data never goes to remote servers. AI models will be able to generate images based on written descriptions as well as drawings.

Microsoft is banking on Qualcomm’s energy-efficient Arm-based chips that can handle AI models to defend its Windows franchise. Apple has gained market share in PC shipments with MacBooks containing its Arm-based chips, having moved away from Intel, the top provider of computer processors.

Microsoft is expanding its effort to surround consumers and business users with ChatGPT-like capabilities. OpenAI, backed by Microsoft, released the ChatGPT chatbot in late 2022, and it quickly took off as a tool for quickly obtaining computer-generated poems, email drafts and summaries of historical events.

Other large technology companies, including Microsoft, soon started augmenting their products with generative AI. A Copilot chatbot drawing on ChatGPT’s underlying AI models came to the Bing search engine, along with the Windows 10 and 11 operating systems. Those with Office productivity software subscriptions could pay extra to have a Copilot refer to their documents for written responses.

The GPT-4 model inside ChatGPT has only done its necessary computing work in Microsoft’s Azure cloud. The new PCs can run some AI models locally without an internet connection. The launch comes nearly four months after Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told analysts on the company’s earnings call that “in 2024, AI will become a first-class part of every PC.”

Microsoft has had little success in getting people to adopt Arm-based Windows computers, which haven’t always performed as well as PCs running Intel or AMD chips. Certain applications have been incompatible.

Running generative AI locally means computers will need more power, and strong battery life becomes more critical. That might make Windows on Arm more compelling.

Analysts with Morgan Stanley expect Arm systems to be 14% of all Windows PC shipments in 2026, up from 0% in 2023, according to a note distributed to clients earlier this month.

85,DELL,Thoughts on NYSE: DELL,"No in depth analysis here, but I've been watching Dell for a few months now. They've had a few run ups and pull backs with another decent run yesterday after Morgan Stanley upgraded them to buy.

They've also beaten estimates the last few quarters and also recently increased their dividend.

Their margins aren't very big though and personal PC market has been less than stellar lately. On top of that they seem to run at a negative equity value with not the best cash flow.

The positive for them with room for growth seems to be the dedicated AI server market which is still only a small part of their revenue.

I finally pulled the trigger yesterday and bought in @145 a share. I'm already down some this morning, but that is usually my case. I'm hoping the bullish trend continues with the AI hype throughout the year and that we add at least another 15 to 20% before yead end.

86,DELL,Dell surges 9% on optimism it has secured big AI server orders ,"Dell shares rose more than 9% on Wednesday to an all-time high after Morgan Stanley raised its price target and predicted that the company would rake in sales from the insatiable demand for artificial intelligence servers.

Dell is seeing accelerating momentum, especially in winning business to build AI servers, unlocking a new bull case for the stock, Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring wrote in a note on Wednesday. He upgraded his price target on Dell from $128 per share to $152 a share and called it a top pick.

“All-in, we are hearing about more AI server momentum at Dell than at any other OEM,” Woodring wrote, saying that he expected about $10 billion of AI server revenue in the company’s fiscal 2025 — ending next February.

Wednesday’s move was the largest since March 1, when the stock surged after earnings showed that the computer manufacturer has benefited from the AI boom.

Dell shares are now up over 95% in 2024, trailing the 220% gain from rival AI servermaker Super Micro Computer but surpassing Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s 5% gains this year.

Most AI servers are built around Nvidia’s chips, which have become prized in the technology industry because they are used to deploy advanced AI models from companies like Google, OpenAI and Meta. Dell sells servers using the newest Nvidia AI chips, including its H100 GPU and the latest Blackwell-generation chips.

At Nvidia’s annual conference in March, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang appeared to send customers who want the latest AI chips to Dell for orders.

“You’re going to need an AI factory,” Huang said. “And nobody is better at building end-to-end systems of very large scale for the enterprise than Dell.”

“Michael [Dell] is here and he’s happy to take your order,” Huang continued.

“While the near-exponential ramp of Nvidia GPU shipments and AI servers builds make it difficult to pin down exact growth rates,” Woodring wrote, he has confidence in Dell’s business for various reasons. Among those reasons are the strengthening demand for AI servers and that he models Dell’s market share increasing.

He wrote that Dell may be able to upsell its customers and “attach” additional hardware, such as data storage.

Dell is expected to announce its April quarter earnings on May 30. Nvidia reports earnings for its quarter ending in April on May 22.

Dell’s other business, building PCs for consumers and businesses running Microsoft Windows, could get a boost next week when Microsoft reveals new capabilities at its conference, including long-awaited AI features that many analysts expect to drive demand for new PCs.

PC sales have slumped for two years in a post-pandemic hangover, as consumers and enterprises who bought new machines during 2020 and 2021 pushed back the timeline for their next upgrades.

But the PC industry is on course to grow again and is outperforming lowered expectations, Woodring wrote, which will benefit Dell.

“We remain bullish on the PC market recovery as we are not only hearing about upgrade/refresh demand in our recent CIO and VAR checks, but also seeing upward revisions to notebook ODM builds in recent months,” Woodring wrote.

27,DELL,IGDI will leverage Ginkgo's Adaptive Laboratory Evolution technology to improve its sourdough starter culture product," Il Granaio delle Idee (IGDI), an innovative international developer and provider of clean label baking ingredients, and Ginkgo Bioworks (NYSE: DNA), which is building the leading platform for cell programming and biosecurity, today announced a new collaboration. IGDI has identified a new sourdough bakery strain that can improve the flavor and aroma profile of baked goods via its starter culture product, Pater®. This collaboration will leverage Ginkgo's Adaptive Laboratory Evolution (ALE) technology to accelerate the growth rate of IGDI's selected strain.

Lactic acid bacteria helps give sourdough its distinctive taste. IGDI has used its proprietary technology to develop a product, Pater, that keeps lactic acid bacteria dispersed in flour, viable and stable over time. Pater is a shelf stable, dried baking mix that can be used to make sourdough en masse, enabling artisanal and industrial bakers to expand their potential offerings of sourdough-based products. Bakers can use Pater to enhance the flavor, fragrance, structure, and color of bread, improve digestibility, and extend bread freshness. Additionally, Pater can produce natural emulsifiers, and can thus lessen the reliance on chemical additives used widely in the baking industry.

IGDI would like to incorporate a new strain in Pater to further improve the flavor and aroma of baked goods. In order to grow this strain economically, IGDI will leverage Ginkgo's ALE technology as it seeks to evolve the strain towards a higher growth rate. Ginkgo uses ALE as a fast, powerful strain development tool that can adapt strains to industrially-relevant conditions without gene editing.

Federico Allamprese Manes Rossi, founder and CEO of Il Granaio delle Idee:
""Our collaboration with Ginkgo Bioworks represents a significant milestone in our entrepreneurial journey. We've watched Ginkgo excel in the food and nutrition space for years, and we couldn't be more excited to work with them. Ginkgo's impressive ALE technology shows promising potential to rapidly improve the growth rate of our strain, and distinguish Pater within the market. Together, we're enhancing product quality, empowering bakers with innovative solutions that elevate their craft, and preserving the expression of culture and identity in food.""

Simon Trancart, Head of ALE at Ginkgo Bioworks:
""This collaboration underscores Ginkgo's commitment to innovation within the food and nutrition industry. We're thrilled to support Il Granaio delle Idee's vision by leveraging our strain optimization tools and powerful ALE technology to elevate their sourdough product to advanced levels of quality and efficiency. We welcome opportunities like this to help customers improve their products with Ginkgo's diverse strain optimization capabilities.""

8,DELL,Dell’s stock is at a new high — and it has beaten Apple’s over a five-year span,"What’s old is new again, at least from Wall Street’s perspective.

Dell Technologies Inc. DELL, +8.56% was a hot company around the turn of the century, as it leapt ahead in the fast-moving race to sell personal computers. The company became the top-selling computer-systems provider globally in 2001.

The brand lost some of its cachet as the years went on, and as Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.48% began to see more traction in the personal-computer market. But Dell seems cool again in the artificial-intelligence era, and investors are taking notice.

The stock closed up 8.6% in Wednesday trading to hit $128.58. That marked a new all-time closing high for the shares, their first in about a month.

Read: Apple’s stock has faltered, but a Steve Jobs moment in AI may be on the horizon

Dell’s stock has enjoyed an explosive recent run, rising 67% so far in 2024 and advancing 214% over the past year. And its performance over a longer span as been notable as well, especially on a relative basis: Dell shares are up 309% over a five-year period, while Apple’s stock is ahead 245%.

Wall Street has a new appreciation for Dell thanks to the company’s position as a backbone of the AI revolution. The shares enjoyed their best day on record in early March, as the company showed rapid shipment growth for its AI-optimized servers. AI-hardware titan Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -0.55% even gave Dell a prominent shoutout at its recent GTC developer event.

“While the company has been through prior technology cycles (server virtualization, public cloud, mobile, etc.), one key difference for AI is that it appears to be incremental” to the total addressable market, Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani wrote in a mid-March note to clients. Earlier shifts in the tech landscape meant that newer technologies displaced legacy ones to an extent, he added.

38,DELL,Why only Super Micro Computer can benefit from AI trend that much while others not?,"Hi,

I'm really confused and can not understand what is the reason for success of Super Micro Computer Stock - MS5 the last two years. What is the fundament for that? People say: it can benefit from growing AI market and sell more AI servers. Well, but when I take a look at their servers, they are not special or not having some critical advantage over servers from HP, Dell, or Lenovo. They just buy or license HGX baseboard and buy SXM GPU modules from NVDIA and put them together which other server manufactures can do as well.

But for some reason only Super Micro Computer stock raises while other not. Do I miss something? Do they have competitive advantages over HP, DELL, Lenovo? Do they have more NVDIA GPU stock than others? Or was it just such undervalued before and now it comes to fair pricing?",27,25,1711369010.0,2024-03-25T12:16:50+00:00,t3_1bnc6pu,StockMarket

Does Dell ring a bell?

104,DELL,AI missing link,"Let’s discuss potential missing link for the AI boom before it spirals into oblivious amount of worldwide adoption and hopefully find a missing link before it kicks off big time because that’s direction where  technology is headed.

First of all we need to discuss what could AI potentially mean for our future and what implications it might have.

To my best of knowledge from reading various statements and articles, AI is going to take a big chunk of jobs across all of the sectors.

Logistics

Teslas Cybertruck will have an option of following one another and therefore you’ll have a fleet of trucks, commandeered by one driver who’s first in the convoy, cruising on a highway
Tesla is already mapping all the roads to perfection before the commercial usage of cybertrucks to it’s fullest.

Automation of factory jobs

There’s activist already actively protesting like we’re back in 1760 during the start of the industrial revolution.


Healthcare 

An AI doctor is currently learning about (Chatgpt-like software) that’s potentially going to make better judgments and diagnosis then the doctors themselves
We still might be a long way down the road from this one, but money is clearly being dumped into projects like these 

Education 

AI softwares will have an ability to recognize students learnings patterns and adapt the learning program to each student individually.
Results have been proven already at staggering 62% grade improvement. 
Not everyone learns the same and that’s the problem AI will fix

These are very few of many sectors in which AI will intertwine with our lives and it’s only the beginning. 

As with all booms in the tech, AI is the logical next step.

For AI to achieve massive adoption it needs computing power, advertisement and ___________?

To break them down

Computing power

If you haven’t heard about Nvidia, Dell, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing etc.  you must live under a rock
These companies have been under the spotlight for a while now and they’re making record deals and gains.
For example.in 2013 Nvidia sold 1.5mil units of their H100 GPUs to Meta, Microsoft, Google and other companies for 37.5Billion in revenue only from 1 processor(wait times were about 6 months).
They’re also expecting to ship 2 million of the same GPU in this year.
With currently a supply being shorter then the demand, many companies are on a race to pick up the biggest pie of the cake and that was reflected on their stock prices.
With that being said ,Computing Power was one fragment of AI boom where the money could have been made by us investors( that’s if you recognized the opportunity on time) .
Not saying there’s no more money to be made in this sector but we’ve definitely come far, fast. 

The next fragment needed for a massive adoption of AI is advertisement.

Google and Amazon are taking the first spots 
AI is directly used in advertising products across all of the sectors.
It’s abilities are reducing the amount of manpower for the job and it’s is also self advertising by doing so.
These kind of automated tasks will give companies the ability to reduce labour cost which will directly translate into higher revenue.
Massive adoption of AI in advertisement sector is coming sooner then you think. 

For a seed to become a tree it will need water, sunlight,and carbon dioxide.
As we mentioned above, massive AI adoption will need Computing Power, Advertisement and something else to really take over the whole technological sector like a wildfire.
The reason why I believe it needs something else to spark is because it’s simply not there yet.

There’s been great opportunities to make money in the last year with crypto going parabolic, especially AI projects, plain company stocks that sell/manufacture semi conductors, playing call options on their earnings, holding or playing call options on microstrategy etc.

With all the above being said, I’m asking you redditors, what is the missing link? 
If we could figure out where will the next big money flow into, we can be ahead of the game and make some serious money.
If Massive AI adoption gas it’s carbon dioxide and water, what would sunlight translate into?",9,30,1710821181.0,2024-03-19T04:06:21+00:00,t3_1bibf6l,wallstreetbets
105,DELL,My (ALMOST) Invincible Call Credit Spread Strategy,"I got a shit ton of interest on a different thread and in my DMs, so I'm going to post this. I should be selling this, really. I'll probably delete this later.

Let me caveat by saying this: I am working on a degree in mathematics and my father taught me how to paper trade when I was only 6 or 7, I've been doing this for 20 years, but I only created this strategy a couple months ago. I say created because every formula I use to calculate my shit is self-made. My math isn't perfect yet. I'm also **NOT** a financial advisor. Please don't take this as advice.

TL;DR. Basically, I sell call credit spreads way out of the money on earnings week on stocks that aren't really great based on traditional technical analysis. If you don't know how this works, or how to do technical analysis, that's a completely separate chunk of information. Some may call this ""picking up pennies in front of a steamroller"" but I wouldn't call what I'm making "" pennies."" and I wouldn't call stocks like Dollar General, Dollar Tree, and Ulta Beauty ""steamrollers"", but ok.

Ok, ready? Good. I'm gonna post this picture - my model - and explain what each line means. Then, I'm gonna explain how I use the info.

[Call Credit Spread Model - 3\/18 - 3\/22](https://preview.redd.it/v8hqq7br2roc1.png?width=1770&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e7df34d32489cad27bfb99cece56395fde66c91)

1. Line 1-3: Stock Info. This should be self-explanatory. The O/price avg is the sum of the at the midpoint of the at the money (ATM) call and ATM put. I use this to calculate the Implied movement (IM) in line 8.
2. Line 4-7: Credit Spread Info. This is info on the actual credit spread I'm potentially going to sell. SL=Price of the Short Leg; LL=Price of the Long Leg; Premium = how much premium I expect to get for selling the spread. SL Delta = Delta of the short leg. SL Delta is important because, for many mathematical reasons, it tells you the rough probability of your buyer being successful. ex. LULU 585/595 the buyer would have a 4% chance of being successful. I use the short leg because if the price of the stock goes above my short leg, I start to lose money, and that's no bueno.
3. Line 8-11: Stats. These are where I start to use my own formulas to determine whether I actually think it's a good idea. Gain = % portfolio gain expected if you sell the spread and win. IM = Implied Movement of the stock during earnings week. % to loss = how much the stock has to go up to cross the short leg and lose money. IM/Loss Ratio = how many times more than the IM the stock would have to move to cross my short leg.
4. Line 12-14: My Scores. My safety score is calculated using by weighing the Delta and IM/loss ratio, taking into account the width of the spread as a percentage of the stock price. It's not out of 100, but the higher the better. My Risk/Reward Score is based on the mathematical concept of fair wagering based on the odds of loss. ex. if a wager is 50/50, the winner should receive back 200% of their wager; however, in a 90/10 wager, The one with a 90% chance to win should receive back only 111.1% of their wager. I use the inverse of the delta to determine the ""ideal"" reward (options are never ideal) and compare it to the actual reward for selling the spread. This one IS out of 100, So that LULU 585/595 spread is 71.7% of ideal.
5. Misc. If you really want to know what this is, you can probably figure it out. I use it more in my put selling model. Also, I have META listed as a control, since sometimes earnings stocks can be weird, just to make sure my model is working correctly.

Ok, so every weekend, I compile my list, then, I take the ones with the best ""Dave Score"" (I wasn't planning on posting this, so I didn't get too creative) and go look at the stock. Generally, If I am actually bearish on a stock, I'll pull the trigger Monday at open. If I am generally bullish on the stock, I pull the trigger as close to the closing bell before they report earnings. Why? If a stock has bullish momentum, the IV is gonna skyrocket exponentially until the report, and the stock is likely to go up pre-earnings too. So, it's better to wait.

You might ask: Why do you use a bearish strategy even if you're bullish? Simple. People are regarded. They pay way too fucking much for options the week of earnings. If someone is willing to pay for call options 30% out of the money on an overvalued company, who am I to deny them? 1 or 2 out of 100 times, they win. That's why I use that analysis to decide which ones are most likely to win for me. And indeed, I have won. All of them. About 25 total trades in a row out of 70-ish that I've analyzed. ONE of those 70 would have lost (DELL). But my model saw it coming, so i stayed away. I've made anywhere from 3-15% per week depending on how many of these I run per week. I started almost 3 months ago.

This is how my model looked when it was just a baby about a month ago - before I optimized it and did primarily earnings.

[My first real model](https://preview.redd.it/fqtodglqeroc1.png?width=697&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2bb1e0a934bff298fec5dd2bf008be27c07db9d)

[My Model V2.](https://preview.redd.it/93j46bdleroc1.png?width=878&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=893cd64409e29c65408b917f7b3a41644ae73acf)

[If any of you are planning on buying these LULU calls from me, I suggest not doing it.](https://preview.redd.it/aw65n4b89roc1.png?width=1417&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e0d66a08af156234074f9aadd7ee086e68a0253)

Why call credit spreads and not put credit spreads? Because people are generally bullish on literally everything.

Will this eventually fail? Mathematically, yes. Over a long enough timeframe and enough samples, anything will fail. That's why I made the model, to keep me as far away from failure as possible until I have enough money to have financial freedom. Hopefully I only have to do this a couple more months. It's not sustainable forever. Should you do it? It's not guaranteed, but sure, I don't care. If you want to use my model this week, go ahead.

If you have questions, DM me. If you want me to make a course so you can buy it from me, DM me. I'm not gonna make a course, but it will make me laugh.

Good luck and happy trading.




EDIT: Please stop swamping my DMs asking for a copy of my spreadsheet. I’ve spent weeks on it and it’s not even finished. I’m not prepared to give it away right now, sorry. ",760,229,1710623078.0,2024-03-16T21:04:38+00:00,t3_1bgg3f3,wallstreetbets

- **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (log variance of daily gains) of the underlying asset and compare that to the current implied volatitlity (IV) of the option price. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium associated with the pricing of options (implied volatility).
    
- **Directional Bias:** Ranges from negative (bearish) to positive (bullish) and accounts for RSI, price trend, moving averages, and put/call skew over the past 6 weeks.

- **Priced Move:** given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move.

- **Expiration:** 2024-03-15.

106,DELL,ORCL Earnings Play (generational wealth),"Ok first off last week i had a terrible time guessing calls or puts for ER and was wrong for like all the big ones. So from the calculations from my regard calculator that means that i am due for a win

# ORCL is going to soar through $130 next week for earnings for a few reasons.

1.) The matrix has to be balanced and i can only take so many losses before a win

2.) Hey, did you hear about ORCL? It's like the 'O' in their name stands for 'Oh, look at this great investment!' Trust me, it's practically written in their ticker symbol.

3.) I had someone reply to one of my comments saying ORCL is a boomer stock and it doesn't move that much. now this may just seem like avg. WSB regard talk but i remembered that i have heard this kind of thing before when talking about possible candidates for ER.

people have only ever responded to me saying something is ""boomer stock"" or ""barley moves"" for 2 things. DELL and AMAT (which were both like 5-10 baggers)

4.) I am playing through batman arkham city right now and there is a character in it and her name is Oracle.

5.) These stocks with the edgy new techno mystique ancient advanced names (like ORCL) always do something goofy.

6.) my grandmother sent me this with no context this morning

7.) Im going to flip a coin

heads- ORCL is going to go up and I post this

tails- ORCL is going to go down and I delete everything ive written

you know the result bc you are seeing this

**TLDR: ORCL is a generational buying opportunity you better not miss out**

107,DELL,"XPEV Earnings Crash, Buy Puts","Just kidding, evil algos probably scan this. What really matters is China Econonmy down long time. Vehicles are cyclical and need to be replaced regularly. It is fairly clear hybrid and electric are the long term direction of the world. I believe the bottom has hit several sectors in the market. With markets like SEMIs mooning with small caps to follow.

I have made -$3000 on my strategic option plays, here is how: 

* \#SNOW $180C  3/15 (holding)
* \#DELL $124C 3/8 (holding)
* \#NIO #6.00C 4/19 (holding)

I figure if I flip a coin three times and it falls on heads, the fourth time should be tails, right?

So XPEV 04/05 8.50 C is gunna moon especially around earnings. This sector has been getting the Wendys dumpster treatment, so this has to be the black cat.

108,DELL,HPE Moon THESIS: SMCI-esce Server Racks and Coffee,"It was a typical Thursday morning. The kind where the only thing standing between me and existential dread was a cup of overpriced coffee. Little did I know, fate had brewed up something special for me at the local Starbucks.

As I stood in line, and ordered caramel macchiato—I bumped into none other than the CEO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Antonio. Yes, the big cheese of HPE themselves.

After a moment of awkward eye contact, the CEO, recognizing an opportunity to make a fan for life or just eager to get me to stop  gaping, offered to buy my drink. ""One caramel macchiato for my new  friend here,"" they announced, as they walked up to Apple Pay.

As I went up to thank him, he said ""No Need, but here's a secret: HPE is going to moon.""

So, fellow investors, next time you find yourself in line for a caramel macchiato, keep your eyes peeled. You never know when the CEO of a tech giant might just buy you a drink and inadvertently reveal the future of the stock market.

After YOLOing into EFUT and making $32k+ yesterday, here's my new insights:

Top competitors to SCMI in the server rack businesses are:

1. Dell
2. HPE.

You already know what happened to Dell during their earnings call. HPE's next earnings is in 2 months. There's currently a dip. After getting my coffee, ended up buying. Play: 2025 $20 calls.

110,DELL,1 month. $3k -&gt; $300k -&gt; $480k,"Sending thanks to the well-wishers that said get it and LFG. To all the rest of you regards that said I’d lose it, here’s the proof I learned my $700k stop-loss lesson from 3 years ago.

I posted the last two days about my plays so don’t say I didn’t tell you about calls on Kroger. Discretionary spending was better than expected last quarter when interest rates dropped. Small businesses picked up biz and people got looser on spending from just necessities to some pricier substitutes. That was my thesis on Square with small businesses coming back, similar thesis on Dell with access to NVidia chips and hitting their laptop cycle this year. Same with Kroger. 

If you’ve read this far, you’ll notice my gains don’t match my balance because I’m only half-regard and have been transferring out $50k every day this week. Image for proof. I just keep making more so 🤷‍♂️

111,DELL,The case to move on from NVDA and AMD (long term),"There are times when I read about GPU makers here and I'm wondering if any of you have ever tried renting GPU by the hour or week or month for AI purposes in the past 2 years? If so have you ever calculated how much you're being charged per FLOP or in general the direction of the price of raw compute? As AI becomes mainstream and inference demand grows, what do you think happens to the basic laws of supply and demand?

&amp;#x200B;

I was in the data center business (aka HPC) until end of last year and I can tell you that pricing for Nvidia A100 rental had compressed by 70% over the last 2 years. The only reason you're seeing all these great GPU sales is because of 2 things: AI compute demand exploded, and greedy mofo distributors have been hording GPUs - yeah you heard me. I used to sell container loads of servers equipped with various GPUs like the A100, and then H100 purchased from the spot market (we do not have the volume to deal with Nvidia directly), and I've seen warehouses full of these GPUs sitting there waiting for the highest bidder. The only way Nvidia (or AMD for that matter) distributors get their discounts and priority is by placing huge orders. While you hear about big news of TSLA or AMZN buying a few billions worth of GPUs from NVDA, significant chunk of their GPU business is distributed by companies you've never heard of and made into complete systems via companies like SMCI. If you own the supply and you restrict the supply on the street, what will happen to the price on the street? There's a warehouse in Yokohama that I've been to that was floor to ceiling in tens of thousands of boxes of GPUs, waiting for the highest bidder.

&amp;#x200B;

Smuggling is also hugely profitable, not that my company ever did that, but we did have a ball selling overpriced A100s to Saudi Arabia before that was banned by the State Dept. However, the story goes that there's a vibrant and profitable smuggling business between Taiwan and China (where the most advanced GPUs are banned) via the Kinmen Islands which is only a few miles away from mainland China. Google Kinmen and you'll see there's been this brouhaha over 2 dead ""fishermen"" from the TWCG chasing and then hitting the ""fishing boat"" (that has FOUR huge outboard engines made for speed) and causing the boat to capsize and killing 2 of 4 ""fishermen"". Coincidence that none of the TWCG law enforcement personnel had their bodycams turned on, and rumor goes that TWCG is actually the biggest smuggler of them all. Why not? A few boxes here and there ""fall off the truck"" by TSM's loading dock and gets picked up by a non-descript van. Anyone ever looked at NVDA sales volume in Taiwan vs. its meager population? Yes they export a lot of that in the form of finished systems, but even the State Dept can't keep track of everything - there are plenty of ways to fudge the numbers, including TSM yield rates on ""defective"" GPUs.

&amp;#x200B;

While TSLA, GOOG, MSFT, AMZN, META can all get their hands on the high end GPUs directly at great discounts, why do you think they also invest heavily in their own AI chip development using RISC-V or ARM? Why do you think companies like Tenstorrent has gotten so much press over the past 12 months around their open RISC-V ecosystem designed for general AI and compute?

&amp;#x200B;

Ah but what do I know, I'm just a permabear regard (according to some) and I have no idea when this Jenga game will end. Enjoy the moonshot while it lasts, and congrats to all who profited hugely on NVDA, DELL, and SMCI the last few weeks.

115,DELL,AMD calls 📞🚀🌕 let’s go!,"I anticipate AMD will skyrocket 🚀 after the next earnings report next month. I took a position today and I am hoping to increase it next week. Dell earnings and news were promising and propelled NVIDIA and AMD to new all-time highs. Unless we see a supply change disruption these chipmakers will continue to soar. If NVIDIA can’t continue to get those chips fast enough guess who all the big AI companies are turning to for their chips. Nvidia is the big shark in the ocean, but AMD’s market share is increasing rapidly by the billions. So at even 5% of the market share of what AMD is projected to earn with AI that’s a big reason to wake this sleeping giant. I’ve been in this stock long and I wouldn’t be shocked if we see it skyrocketing over $250 per share next earnings. Nvidia has CUDA which is what most programmers want, but AMD chips can also work on CUDA unfortunately they cut the project short. I can also see INTEL producing chips designed by AMD and manufacturing them as well. Who else is in on this and sees the potential? I’ve already doubled my money on NVIDIA.

40,DELL,Logitech Analysis_Part 2 Comparison,"As many competitors of Logitech are not public companies, and most of them operate in different businesses, it is challenging to select exact competitors. I chose some public companies with PC &amp; Peripheral businesses for this comparison.

&amp;#x200B;

[Growth Comparison](https://preview.redd.it/glg8d8dz6wkc1.png?width=612&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=844f7a5ab66c6138af408566af1cffe82c09f453)

**Growth**

Most companies experienced negative growth in revenue and profit due to demand normalization. However, Logitech's revenue growth ability is comparatively weaker, with an average revenue decline of 8% over the past three years. Its profit growth is slightly better but not outstanding. Dell has been the most stable in the past three years, with positive growth rates in revenue and profit. Cherry achieved the highest revenue growth, but its profit has not been as impressive and is very volatile. Compared with Rapoo, which operates a similar business to Logitech, Logitech has done well to maintain its profit but has lost more revenue growth.

Logitech's growth ability is not attractive, indicating its product demand has experienced a greater retreat than its competitors. However, Logitech still has advantages in the industry chain, as it can keep profit decline minimal when demand slows down.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Margin Comparison](https://preview.redd.it/b24crj437wkc1.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf79f9c3a65fba91a015c7d224a90db4cb50e859)

**Profitability**

The PC, Peripheral, and OEM industry does not generally generate very high margins. Logitech demonstrates strong profitability, taking a leading role in gross margin, operating margin, and free cash flow margin compared to its competitors. This indicates that Logitech enjoys higher product premiums and supply chain advantages. Logitech supports its gross margin through a mix strategy across multiple product lines. On the other hand, Logitech reinvests more in new products and supply chain integration, benefiting its market competition and operating efficiency.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Profit Quality Comparison ](https://preview.redd.it/aqb1qqac7wkc1.png?width=561&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e7e7c6720ebd9547fa8a7ee29c0fceef3da5feb)

**Profit Quality**

Most companies have high-quality profits, as operating cash flow being higher than net income, suggesting that all profits from the business can convert to cash flow. Cherry and Turtle Beach have better cash flow compared to their net income, but both have negative net profits and cash flows, making them not comparable in this ratio. Logitech and Rapoo have good profit quality but are slightly behind Asustek and Dell in cash generation. This is likely due to the impact of the PC business.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Operating Comparison ](https://preview.redd.it/sfkubykg7wkc1.png?width=635&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9391864bace8954f174383b303d786c914686278)

**Operating Efficiency**

The chart shows that the PC business is more efficient in inventory and cash turnover. Compared with its competitors, Logitech has lower days of inventory and negative days of cash, indicating high operating efficiency in the industry. This is benefited from its reinvestment in supply chain integration, manufacturing upgrades in Suzhou, and sharing live data with its suppliers.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Capital &amp; Investment Return Comparison ](https://preview.redd.it/llr3xrqj7wkc1.png?width=678&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41aa1e9363b5301e15805abef5454e9965c758b8)

**Capital &amp; Investment Return**

Logitech stands out with the highest capital return margin compared to its competitors, suggesting high capital use efficiency. Rapoo, Cherry, and Turtle Beach are not performing well, as their capital return margins are negative. Considering the share buyback effect, Logitech generates a medium investment return with a 5% annual yield. Compared to Cherry, Logitech is well-supported by its high free cash flow. Rapoo is not planning to pay dividends, and Turtle Beach is still experiencing profit loss.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Solvency Comparison ](https://preview.redd.it/8vd797xm7wkc1.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=961290b548b53a6821ce98a66bac1df2597fcdba)

**Solvency**

All companies compared have healthy balance sheets with low financial leverage and a low ratio of Debt to EBITDA. Logitech is in a medium position compared to its peers, indicating a lower insolvency risk. Cherry and Turtle Beach have more risk due to negative cash flow and profit.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Valuation Comparison ](https://preview.redd.it/zzg2a5lq7wkc1.png?width=514&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e23b9fc08a8ebe2067c24184afeaaaffd1e69e4)

**Valuation**

Logitech's valuation is not attractive compared to PC &amp; Peripheral companies, but it is better than Rapoo and Cherry, which are Peripheral only companies. As Logitech's multiples exceed its 20-year average and those of its main competitors, I strongly believe investors may require a larger discount to increase their positions, unless Logitech can reignite its growth. From a cash flow and margin perspective, Logitech has more advantages compared to other players, potentially justifying a premium in its valuation.

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion**

After this comparative analysis, although revenue growth has been muted, I still believe Logitech is an excellent company because it has demonstrated leading product gross margins, efficient operations, strong cash flow generation, and a healthy balance sheet compared to its competitors. As the price has retreated following the financial report release and the change in CEO, I think it's an opportunity to reconsider this company and its potential growth opportunities in the gaming unit and wait for a more attractive valuation.",6,1,1708937474.0,2024-02-26T08:51:14+00:00,t3_1b0cxvg,StockMarket

145,DELL,Case for JBL (Jabil),"With the insane hype around Supermicro Computers, I'd like to introduce Jabil Circuit ($JBL) as a noteworthy alternative. My expertise lies in Cloud Architecture and Datacenter Engineering, a field where I've been developing infrastructure for Fortune 500 companies for over ten years.

Public and private cloud providers rely heavily on server nodes to operate machine learning/deep learning models and AI, necessitating rapid scalability. As the demand for Datacenters escalates, leading providers such as Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Amazon Web Services (AWS) continue to expand, launching new regions to ensure redundancy and high availability. Within this environment five suppliers stand out: HPE, Dell, Supermicro, Intel, and Jabil.

It's important to note the distinction in offerings among these suppliers. While HPE and Dell are known for their comprehensive range of storage and networking solutions, Supermicro and Jabil specialize in assembling servers utilizing components from leading semiconductor manufacturers like Intel, Samsung, and NVIDIA. This specialization places a premium on efficiency and lead times, a critical factor where Jabil excels. Historically, Supermicro has struggled with extended lead times, which, as of 2022, exceeded four months for new server orders, a delay that persists but slightly improved today. In contrast, Jabil not only matches Supermicro's capabilities but also surpasses them in efficiency and cost-effectiveness. As an authorized partner for the Azure HCI stack, a credential it shares with Dell, HPE, and Supermicro - Jabil offers a insane value prop, being approximately 30% less expensive for all builds and boasting delivery times for servers that Supermicro could not fulfill, often within two months.

Jabil's strengths extend beyond its competitive pricing and swift turnaround times. The company has a super robust manufacturing network, with facilities strategically located worldwide, including Guadalajara MX, which facilitates expedited shipping to the United States. This global footprint is instrumental in Jabil's ability to dominate not only in the server market but also across various sectors, including chips, automotive, medical, optics and many more.

Take a look at the Jabil Optics: [](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hodbxeli3ay)

I am getting +100 $150 Jabil calls for 3/15 at MO tomorrow, they are due to report their earnings on 3/14 before market open. Calls on Jabil went 8x last earnings.

146,DELL,Why I Believe Nvidia Will Continue To Grow For The Remainder of 2024,"The Santa Clara, California-based company controls about 80% of high-end AI chip market, a position that has sent its stock market value up 40% so far this year to $1.73 trillion after it more than tripled in 2023.

As of February 13, 2024 Nvidia has a P/E ratio of 95.24 which may seem high and it totally is understandable. Company seems overweight, compared to competitors such as Intel who have or P/E ratio of 107.63 or AMD 326.41. Compared to competitors they are not as over valued. 

Lets compare Nvidia with other companies around its market cap. Amazon has a P/E ratio of 58.16. The difference between Amazon and Nvidia is Nvidia is bound for more growth in the near future with the boom of AI which they control the AI chip market by a crazy 80%. What about their financials, last quarter Nvidia had 18.12 Total Revenue with a net income of 9.24 billion. Amazon had 143.08 billion with net income of 9.88 billion. Nvidia has a huge profit margin of 51.01% compared to Amazon's measly  6.9%. No doubt Amazon is trying to create a bigger net profit margin but so would Nvidia. 

Recently Canada had signed a letter of intent to engage in business with Nvidia. Recent CEO Huang discussed that not only is Canada prioritizing AI infrastructure but also Japan, France, South Korea, Malaysia, Italy and Britain. This tells us that countries want to buy these chips from producers around the world which Nvidia are currently leading. Only problem is supply chain issues.

With this kind of demand meeting supply is dificult. Hopefully Nvidia is able to capitalize this and meet this enormous demand with increased prices to maximize revenue.

Nvidia is setting foot in creating energy efficient computing for AI. They are making custom chips for clients such as Meta, Amazon, etc... To become more efficient in specific needs for each clients. This opens up multiple new paths for increased revenue. Not just that Nvidia is creating Gpu's for the consumers which compute the power for AI, of course enough power to game and design.

\---**Major current buyers:**

* **Cloud giants:**
   * **Meta:** A major spender, reportedly purchasing billions of dollars worth of H100 chips for their Metaverse ambitions and AI development.
   * **Microsoft:** Another big investor, aiming to power cloud services and its Azure AI platform with Nvidia's tech.
   * **Amazon:** Utilizing Nvidia chips for their AWS cloud services and internal AI endeavors.
   * **Google:** While Google develops its own AI chips, they also leverage Nvidia's technology for specific applications.
* **Tech companies:**
   * **Baidu:** China's tech giant is reportedly a significant buyer, using Nvidia chips for AI research and development.
   * **Tencent:** Another Chinese tech player heavily invested in AI, likely utilizing Nvidia's chips for various projects.
   * **Alibaba:** Their spending details are less transparent, but they're likely in the mix due to their extensive AI efforts.
   * **Dell:** As a major PC and server manufacturer, they incorporate Nvidia GPUs in their offerings, contributing to Nvidia's sales.

\---**Potential future buyers:**

* **Other cloud providers:** Companies like IBM Cloud and Oracle Cloud could increasingly turn to Nvidia chips for their AI offerings.
* **Startups and smaller companies:** As AI gains traction in various industries, adoption of Nvidia's technology by smaller players is expected to grow.
* **Governments:** For projects in areas like national security, healthcare, and research, governments could become significant buyers.

\---**Global reach, with limitations:**

* Nvidia does aim for widespread sales, reaching numerous countries across the globe. They have customers in various regions, including North America, Europe, Asia, and more.

\---**Export controls and restrictions:**

* However, Nvidia needs to adhere to export control regulations set by the US government, where they're headquartered. These regulations might restrict sales to specific countries or for certain uses.

**Examples of restrictions:**

* In October 2023, the US implemented restrictions on selling their most advanced AI chips to China, aiming to prevent their use for military or other sensitive applications.
* Similar restrictions might apply to other countries in the future, depending on evolving policies.
* Such restrictions can reduce sales but they weren't selling much to China either way. Now they sell chips with slightly less computing power.

**Upcoming potential announcements (based on rumors and speculations):**

* **GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs:** While not officially confirmed, new consumer graphics cards are expected sometime in 2024 or 2025, likely offering further performance boosts for gamers.
* **Next-gen DRIVE autonomous vehicle platform:** Nvidia's self-driving technology is constantly evolving, and the next iteration of the DRIVE platform might bring significant advancements.
* **New AI chips:** Beyond the recently released H100, Nvidia is likely working on even more powerful and specialized AI chips for various applications.  With the H200 coming second quarter of 2024.

The biggest worries are geopolitical tensions and export restrictions. Do what you will with this info regards.

1,DELL,Breakdown Of Volatility Strategies For Earnings,"Rather than simply buying calls, puts or predicting market directions on earnings, we find in literature many effective strategies that center around volatility.

Specifically, there’s a consistent pattern of implied volatility increasing in the lead-up to the release and subsequently plummeting on the actual earnings day (IV crush). This unique volatility dynamic opens up various avenues for implementing strategies before, during, and after the earnings release, providing traders with opportunities to capitalise on these market dynamics.

## What Are Volatility Strategies?

Leading up to earnings, the implied volatility of options typically increases in anticipation of the release. However, on the day of the release, IV experiences a significant drop, leading to a higher-than-normal expected stock movement that is factored in for the release day.

The market anticipates the stock’s movement on earnings day and tends to incorporate this into pricing. The focus here is on the absolute magnitude of the move rather than its direction.

This anticipated move, as reflected by implied volatility, does not always accurately predict the actual market movement, presenting opportunities for strategic positioning.

## Long Volatility — Smart Gambles

Long volatility is a strategy where one speculates that the actual stock move will surpass the implied move. In other words, implied volatility will be lower than the realized volatility, and the stock’s movement will exert a greater influence on the position price than the effects of IV crush and theta decay.

This strategy typically involves non-directional positions, such as straddles, strangles, inverse condors, and butterflies. Precise adjustment of strike prices and expiration dates in the risk profile enables the customisation of a position that aligns with one’s risk tolerance.

It is essential to note that long positions during earnings carry the risk of substantial losses if the actual market movement is disappointingly low, primarily due to IV crush.

The key is to establish a position with a favorable implied move compared to past moves, and we can calibrate the position to reduce potential losses with different techniques.

As an illustration, below is the price simulation of a classic straddle position with the closest expiration for DELL earnings.

https://preview.redd.it/7vyssog2rk3c1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4099998eb5bb9c4d8416a29d678b5d6d568b293

&amp;#x200B;

## Short Volatility — IV Crush Collection

Conversely, short volatility is betting that the stock move will stay within the implied range, resulting in an overall decrease in options prices due to IV crush and theta decay. Positions for this strategy include short straddles, strangles, condors, and butterflies.

However, caution is advised, as selling options inherently carries risks. Improper calibration, particularly in pure short straddles and strangles, can lead to unlimited losses.

For instance, unexpected high stock prices, as seen with significant jumps in stocks like NFLX in 2022 or NVDA in 2023, can pose substantial risks.  
Therefore, positions should be carefully calibrated with capped losses and wide implied moves to create a favorable risk-reward profile.

As an example, below is a butterfly position (short straddle combined with long strangle) on DELL earnings. Notice how even at a substantial move, simulated on the day of earnings, the position loss is capped thanks to its calibration.

## Studying Past Moves For Calibration

Analysing historical earnings movements is crucial for comprehending past behavior, in order to well calibrate a volatility position. This involves scrutinizing past moves across various time frames, including long periods such as the last decade, as well as recent trends.

An important aspect of this analysis involves studying the distribution of past movements, specifically the frequency of each movement range. This aids in establishing a realistic range of movements and identifying potential outliers that should be factored into your calibration.

Below is an example of some insights about DELL past earnings from our tools.

147,DELL,What's the verdict on DELL's earnings tonight guys?,"I keep this one short. Dell Technologies Inc. (DELL) is projected to release financial results for its fiscal 2024 third quarter, today after the closing bell. Analysts expect the company to post quarterly earnings at $1.46 per share, down from year-ago earnings of $2.30 per share. The company’s revenue might come in the range of $22.5-$23.5 billion for the latest quarter, this is also a decrease from the year prior. However, according to seeking alpha, DELL has beaten EPS estimates 100% of the time over the last 2 years and has beaten revenue estimates 88% of the time. Over the last 3 months, EPS estimates have seen 12 upward revisions and 3 downward. Revenue estimates have seen 12 upward revisions and 0 downward.

Dell expects both Client Solutions Group (CSG) and Infrastructure Solutions Group revenues to be roughly flat sequentially in the to-be-reported quarter. Continued sluggish IT spending by corporate and global enterprise customers is expected to have hurt top-line growth.

But wait, there's more. Dell's also getting smacked around by some nasty currency exchange rates. They're expecting a slight hit on their revenues because of this. Ouch.

But now, let's talk PCs. Demand's kinda meh right now. Gartner's spitting out some numbers saying worldwide PC shipments dipped 9% year-over-year in Q3 2023, down to about 64.279 million units. Dell's sitting in the third spot in the PC market race, behind Lenovo and HP, but hey, at least they're ahead of Apple.

This company shipped 10.32 million units, witnessing a 14.2% year-over-year decline in the third quarter of 2023, per the Gartner report. Just for comparison: Lenovo, HP and Apple shipped 16.146 million, 13.531 million and 6.266 million units, respectively.

Keep in mind, DELL is expected to benefit from the generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) boom as big tech increasingly invests in it. Dell's getting a piece of that sweet AI pie, diving headfirst into this generative AI craze. Dell’s expanding Generative AI solutions portfolio is expected to have accelerated top-line growth. They've got this thing called Dell Validated Design for Generative AI with NVIDIA, it offers pre-trained models that extract intelligence from data, sparing enterprises from building models from scratch.

Dell Validated Designs for Generative AI now supports both model tuning and inferencing. The solution is supported by the Dell PowerEdge XE9680 AI server or the Dell PowerEdge XE8640, with a choice of NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs and NVIDIA AI Enterprise software, which offers frameworks, pre-trained models and development tools, such as the NVIDIA NeMo framework and Dell software.

I'm going to grab calls, because I'm expecting a turn-around in sales and them to beat expectations once again. I gotta remind you guys for those who missed out last quarter, DELL went up well over 15% with earnings. It went up the earnings prior too and the one before that. What's also great is that the cons are cheap due to lower strike prices. So I'm going to grab 12/1 77c @ 1.80. We just need the stock to go up ~4.6% to break even here. Be mindful of the bid/ask spread tho, since this is a lower-volume contract. 75 and 76c boasts higher volume, but are a bit more expensive. To make things even cheaper, you can consider a put spread. Regardless, just like my other posts: this isn't financial advice. I'd like to just show people the type of stuff we tend to look at when trying to attempt an earning play. This hopefully will help you with future earning plays too. Next week, we have NIO, AI, and CHWY. And don't forget, Gamestop!",19,36,1701364250.0,2023-11-30T17:10:50+00:00,t3_187nl2x,wallstreetbets
148,DELL,Why SNOW puts will be an easy win,"Yesterday, I explained why [CRWD calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1865z5q/crwd_earnings_alert_everything_you_need_to_know/) were gonna be easy profits, and got 220c's for 3.90. These calls are now 13.65 (over 3x gains), with the stock up almost 10% today at the time of writing. Now today, we're going to look at Snowflake (SNOW); reporting Q3 earnings on today. 

Analysts forecast earnings of $0.159 per share as opposed to earnings of $0.110 in the same quarter of the previous year. Snowflake is expected to report sales of $713.6 million, an increase of 28.11% over the same period last year. For the current fiscal year, they expect earnings per share of $0.683 compared to $0.250 per share in the previous year. On average, we are expecting a revenue of $2.75 billion, compared to $2.07 billion last year.

For those who don't know, the company’s key offering is a scalable, efficient cloud-based data warehousing platform. Snowflake’s platform enables organizations to store and analyze large volumes of structured and semi-structured data. Thus, businesses can run complex queries across multiple cloud platforms. Snowflake’s fiscal third-quarter performance is expected to have benefited from an expanding clientele and a strong partner base. Notably, it added more than 400 Snowpark customers and consumption grew roughly 70% on a sequential basis in the fiscal second quarter. Big customers include Mastercard, Honeywell, and Disney. 

At the end of the fiscal second quarter, SNOW had 402 customers with trailing 12-month product revenues greater than $1 million (up 62% year over year) and 639 Forbes Global 2000 customers (up 16.6% year over year). Of the Global 2000 customers, 63% are using Snowpark on a weekly basis.

Customers are accessing Snowflake for data science, machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). And this is a really hot topic because as an AI play, Snowflake appears positioned for long-term success if headwinds further diminish. Snowflake’s innovative approach places it at the forefront of significant trends in generative AI and related tools. The company introduced Snowflake Cortex, a user-friendly service enabling both technical and non-technical users to analyze data and build AI applications. A standout feature is the “Universal Search” function, streamlining data location within the data lake, with a ChatGPT-style bot facilitating easy answers to business queries.

The growing adoption of Snowpark by data scientists and engineers is expected to have aided the company’s top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter. Snowflake has been expanding its ML footprint with the introduction of ML-powered SQL extensions, such as anomaly detection, top insights and time series forecasting, which are useful for analysts.

Optimization? Yeah, SNOW's got some kinks to iron out. The company faces optimization challenges, but consumption headwinds are starting to chill out. A return to normal consumption growth and new product introduction should support growth. AI benefits are expected, but the impact is uncertain.

Additionally, Snowflake stock is trading at a P/E of 246 currently. The high valuation creates downside risk if growth doesn’t stabilize. The company’s outlook may be limited unless growth stabilizes.

Consensus analyst ratings for Snowflake stock stand at a Buy with a price target of $183.27. The stock is currently in the 170s. 

Morgan Stanley Research analyst Sanjit Singh sees Snowflake well positioned given the multiple avenues for growth. However, he cautions that the potential for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) applications might encounter increased competition. Morgan Stanley has a $215 price target on Snowflake stock.

Piper Sandler analyst Brent A. Bracelin expects earnings volatility to continue as Snowflake reports Q3 earnings. The biggest debate for those analyzing the company will be tied to whether cloud optimization headwinds that have pressured growth for more than a year begin to abate, he said.

Bottom line: SNOW's got the tech and the talent to skyrocket, but they gotta keep their growth game tight. Keep your eyes peeled, traders – SNOW's about to show us that they're a winter wonder.

For earnings, I'm considering getting 170p. Why puts? After all my research, it seems extremely bullish. But I have to consider the moves from previous earnings, despite a good report. Down over 7% last time. The time before? -11%. Even worse the quarter before that. SNOW seems to go against common sense here and take a dip with good news, at least 3 times in a row. SNOW 12/1 170p at 4.80 works for me because it would require only a 6% drop to break even. The company has seen an average of ~9% move with earnings. To make things cheaper, you can consider a put spread. Regardless, just like my other posts: this isn't financial advice. I'd like to just show people the type of stuff we tend to look at when trying to attempt an earning play. This hopefully will help you with future earning plays too. We have OKTA, and DELL this week.

149,DELL,CRWD Earnings Alert: Everything you need to know 🚀🔥,"Yo guys, cybersecurity provider CrowdStrike (CRWD) is scheduled to announce its fiscal third-quarter earnings today, after the market closes. Analysts expect the company’s revenue and EPS for the third quarter (ended July 2023) to increase 33.8% and 84.9% year-over-year to $777.38 million and $0.74, respectively. Moreover, CrowdStrike reported better-than-expected financial results in the last reported quarter. And get this: last time around, these cyber gurus smashed the estimates with a killer Q2, bagging $731.63M in revenue. That's beating the guesswork of $724.44M from the analysts. Straight up crushing last year's $506.20M in Q2 2023. Buckle up, boys, we might see some fireworks! 🚀💥💸

CRWD’s annual recurring revenue (ARR) grew 37% year-over-year and reached $2.93 billion as of July 31, 2023, of which $196.20 million was net new ARR added during the quarter.

The cloud company further reported an adjusted EPS of $0.74. That's not just smashing the street's guess of $0.56, but also up a massive 105.6% from last year's quarter. Talk about leveling up! During the second quarter, these cyber kings raked in a record $245M in cash flow ops and a whopping $189M in free cash. That's what we call making it rain!

But hold up, it gets better. Importantly, CRWD has an impressive history of delivering strong quarterly performances. The company beat analysts’ earnings expectations for 15 consecutive quarters (fuckin' legendary win streak🚀), signaling they might blast past estimates yet again. Wall Street is very upbeat about the demand backdrop for CrowdStrike, especially with cyberattacks going nuts. Sounds like the cyber world is CRWD's playground, and they're just scoring one win after another. 📈👀

“CrowdStrike delivered strong growth at scale, exceeding our guidance across both top and bottom line metrics in the second quarter,” said George Kurtz, CRWD’s President, CEO, and Co-Founder.

“The AI-powered Falcon platform’s native capabilities across our cloud, identity, and next-gen SIEM businesses are unique in the market, in aggregate contributing well over half a billion dollars in ending ARR. Our platform strategy sets us apart from the competition, resulting in high win rates as customers rapidly embrace Falcon to consolidate vendors, lower TCO and achieve better security outcomes,” he added.

After earnings topped estimates, CRWD raised its outlook for the full fiscal year 2024. For the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the company expects revenue to be between $775.40 million and $778 million. Non-GAAP income from operations and net income attributable to CrowdStrike are expected to be $154.40-156.30 million and $179.80-$181.80 million, respectively.

Further, the cybersecurity company expects non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike common stockholders to be $0.74.

For the full year 2024, CRWD anticipates its revenue and non-GAAP income from operations to be $3.03-$3.04 billion and $601.30-$610.50 million, respectively. Also, non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike is expected to be $680.50-$689.70 million and $2.80-$2.84 per share, respectively.

Shares of CRWD have gained 15.6% over the past month and 41.2% over the past six months to close the last trading session at $210.66. The stock has surged 104% year-to-date.

Okay, but that's all in the past. Here’s what could influence CRWD’s performance in the upcoming months:

CrowdStrike’s third-quarter fiscal 2024 results are likely to reflect the benefits of the continued solid demand for its products, given the healthy environment of the global security market. The increasing number of people logging into employers' networks has triggered a greater need for security and might have spurred the demand for CRWD’s products in the fiscal third quarter. A strong pipeline of deals indicates the same.

Subscription revenue? Dude, stellar growth that's juicing up the top line big time. Plus, the crew at CRWD's been busy pulling in fresh subscribers like there's no tomorrow, giving their earnings a sweet boost.

And get this: CrowdStrike's bromance with Amazon Web Services (AWS) is paying off big. Their products chilling on the AWS platform? Genius move. We're seeing more deals pop off in AWS Marketplace, co-selling shenanigans with the AWS sales gang, and mad love for AWS service integrations. All this is set to turbocharge CRWD's earnings in the quarter we're all eyeing. 💻

**Positive Recent Developments**

On November 22, CRWD announced that its AI-powered cybersecurity offering for small and medium businesses (SMBs), CrowdStrike Falcon Go, is officially available on Amazon Business. This marks the first CrowdStrike offering on Amazon’s business-to-business (B2B) store and the broadest dedicated distribution channel for CRWD’s growing SMB offerings to date.

Moreover, this game-changing CRWD offering, CrowdStrike Falcon Go, was launched on November 15. With a few simple clicks, SMBs can quickly and easily deploy industry-leading protection to stop the modern cyberattacks that ineffective antivirus products may miss.

**Robust Financials** 

CRWD’s revenue increased 36.7% year-over-year to $731.60 million for the fiscal 2024 second quarter ended July 31, 2023. Its non-GAAP income from operations grew 78.4% from the year-ago value to $155.70 million. Also, non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike was $180 million, compared to $85.90 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023.

Furthermore, non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike per share was $0.74, an increase of 105.6% year-over-year. Net cash generated from operations was $244.80 million, compared to $209.90 in the previous year’s period. Its free cash flow came in at $188.70 million, up 39% year-over-year.

**Favorable Analyst Estimates**

Analysts are placing their bets high on CRWD, expecting a monster 35.6% year-over-year growth in revenue, hitting $3.04B for the fiscal year ending Jan 2024. And that's not all – they're predicting EPS to rocket up 83.8% to $2.83. Talk about printing money! Plus, these cyber wizards have been beating the street's guesses on revenue and EPS for the last four quarters straight. They're not just playing the game; they're owning it!

But wait, there's more! For fiscal 2025, the forecast is looking juicy with revenue and EPS expected to balloon by 28.6% and 24.6% to a whopping $3.91B and $3.53, respectively. CRWD isn't just shooting for the moon; they're on a one-way trip to Mars with these growth numbers! 🌌

**Elevated Valuation**

Get a load of this: CRWD is trading with a forward non-GAAP P/E ratio of 74.45x, which is a whopping 224.5% higher than the industry's average of 22.94x. That's not just a lead, that's dominating the whole game! It's up to you to decide if you think this is a good thing or a bad thing. 

But hold up, it gets crazier. CRWD's forward EV/Sales and EV/EBITDA are sitting at a sky-high 15.78x and 65.85x. Compare that to the industry's measly 2.63x and 14.63x, and it's like CRWD's playing chess while everyone else is stuck on checkers.

And if that wasn't enough to make your head spin, peep this: CRWD's forward Price/Sales and Price/Cash Flow are at 16.55 and 47.27. That's 529.7% and 119.8% higher than the industry averages of 2.63 and 21.51. CRWD isn't just ahead, they're in a whole different league! 🚀

**Mixed Profitability**
🔍 Dive into these numbers, folks: CRWD’s trailing-12-month gross profit margin is a juicy 74.04%, crushing the industry average of 48.67% by a massive 52.1%. They're not just playing the game; they're rewriting the rules.

But wait, there's more: their levered FCF margin over the past 13 months? A whopping 33.44%, which is a mind-blowing 307.8% higher than the industry's 8.20%. CRWD is basically printing cash compared to the rest of the pack.

Now, not all sunshine and rainbows: CRWD's trailing-12-month EBIT margin is in the red at -5.78%, lagging behind the industry's 4.69%. Same story with their net income margin at -3.54%, which is lower than the industry's 1.77%. And when it comes to ROCE, ROTC, and ROTA? They're sitting at -6.10%, -4.08%, and -1.69%, not exactly shining compared to industry averages of 0.80%, 2.60%, and 0.07%.

So yeah, CRWD is killing it in some areas, but they've still got some homework to do in others. 📚

**What to do for Earnings?**

CRWD has moved an average of 8% with earnings. It seems reasonable to grab a CRWD 12/1 220c @ 3.90. You'd need the stock to hit ~224 by Friday to break even, which is about a 5.5% gain. Easy, right? Well, that's what I'm grabbin. Keep in mind, like my other posts: this isn't financial advice. I'd like to just show people the type of stuff we tend to look at when trying to attempt an earning play. This hopefully will help you with future earning plays too.

30,DELL,"Expected moves this week: VERY low IV in SPY/SPX, earnings from Salesforce, Crowdstrike and more.","SPY/SPX was higher by about 1% in holiday-shortened trading last week, slightly more than what options were pricing. The gamma we've discussed in these posts that held SPX near the 4500 level mostly expired after Nov monthly expiration the week before but the Thanksgiving week saw low volumes and not a ton of volatility to give an indication of what type of option backdrop we'll see over the next few weeks. If we were to see some volatility before year end it would most likely come in the next two weeks while the gamma forces are not as significant, and, there's a decent amount of economic data and Fedspeak.

Implied Vol is VERY low across the board. The VIX closed Friday near 12.50. At the money IV in SPY/SPX is below 10 for several days this week. The VIX has been a straight line down from 22 in late October. As discussed previously that can have a self-fulfilling crush on both implied vol AND realized vol, loading the market up with gamma while market makers drastically lower option bids across the board to stop drowning in long premium. Those conditions often lead to a slow creep higher where the risk on option selling each day is to the upside with expected moves so narrow. The conditions would most likely flip with an accelerating sell-off in stocks where investors finally looked to buy protection again. Whether that occurs in any way this week or next remains to be seen. If it does not we then re-enter a holiday period at year-end and a December expiry that could once again be loaded with gamma. Before now and then there are this week's GDP, PCE and a Powell Speech. Next week is an important Jobs Number, and after that is CPI. So some things to watch for on the calendar.

Earnings season is coming to an end but some interesting names remain. This week sees Crowdstrike, Salesforce, Snowflake and a few others.

**Expected Moves This Week**

* SPY/SPX: 0.9%
* QQQ: 1.3%
* IWM: 1.7%

**0DTE Expected Moves**

88,DELL,How wide is SMCI's moat ?,"I don't work in the tech industry, so I was wondering if any of you have an informed opinion on how strong SMCI's competitive advantage is ?

From what I understand, SMCI builds custom server racks using other companies hardware/components. Their knowledge/advantage lies in how efficient and ''first to market'' their rack builds are. I know they do a lot of testing and research. In their 10k, they say they own a lot of patents and feel confident their ''technology'' and ''know how'' is protected and will keep giving them a competitive advantage in the future. 

Charles Liang (their founder and CEO) also owns multiple patents, but I didn't find any details on the internet.

I was wondering, considering they rely on other companies products, how reliable is their moat ?

From what I read, their main competitors are DELL and HPE. How easy or hard would it be for them to catch up ?

42,DELL,How much volume should I be looking for to make a trade worth it?,"As you can probably guess by the title still very new to trading. Mostly just paper trading at the moment.

A problem I'm running into on a lot of trades is there is really not enough volume to move the stock a significant amount. Obviously that doesn't make for a great trade. What I see happen often is the stock spikes and has some good volume but it dies off fairly quickly and doesn't do much else. So what sort of volume would I want to look for if I were making a swing trade and what about a day trade? 

For an example I've been looking at Dell recently as I seen they had a good earnings report and they just hit a new all time high. The volume jumped off but its starting to slow down and cool off, so seems I'm late to the party and just seen it too late I suppose. So how do you know when you've got enough volume?

Other question would be, if your looking to make a swing trade say over a week or two, what chart do you mainly use, the 5-day, the daily chart, the monthly, all of them?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As a side note I'm well aware making a day trade is risky, most traders lose money in the market and the odds are very much against me. So all that said let's just assume I'm stubborn enough that I'm going to do it anyway and skip that part.

Thanks in advance!!",5,6,1694571680.0,2023-09-13T02:21:20+00:00,t3_16haot8,StockMarket
33,DELL,"Expected Moves, Docusign, Apple and more","First, a couple of earnings moves from last night, GameStop is slightly higher well off its after-hours highs, and now well inside its expected move. UiPath in a very similar situation, slightly higher but off its post-earnings highs outside market hours and now well inside what options were pricing. On the flipside C3.ai Inc (AI)is down about 14%, slightly more than the 12.5% move options were pricing. The big story since late yesterday is AAPL's quick plunge following reports that the Chinese government is extending the prohibition of Apple’s iPhones. Apple is down more than 7% since yesterday afternoon.

To put that move in perspective, Apple options were not pricing a 7%+ move until late November. In fact, the recent chart in Apple looks a bit detached from current low IV in the options in general, with the stock having just made 7%+ moves several times since late July:

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/2s3cuvpb7umb1.gif

Apple vol is low historically, with 30-day IV about 23, while the past year's realized vol has been 29. The assumption often with a mega-cap stock like AAPL is that while bouts of volatility happen, the stock will reset to a grind higher at some point with low realized and implied vol. But AAPL has been moving for the past month and change in ways that options continue to underprice.

Docusign is the big earnings after the bell. Options are pricing about a 9% move at the moment. Prior earnings have seen moves of -3, -23% +12% and +11%.

34,DELL,"Expected moves, Lululemon, Broadcom and MongoDB","A couple of earnings of note after the close yesterday. Salesforce is higher by about 6.5% this morning, slightly more than the expected move. CrowdStrike is unched, obviously inside the expected move. Dollar General reported this morning and is getting hammered, down 18%. Retailer volatility has been one of the themes of this earnings season. This afternoon we get another retailer in LuluLemon as well as Broadcom and MongDB.

Here's a look at LULU's set-up. Options are pricing about a 6.5% move. That compares to the last 4 moves of +11%, 0%, -13% and +7%. So splitting the difference but more like a mean than a median as 3 of the last 4 moves have been larger than what's expected this event:

Apple (AAPL) announced its fiscal Q3 earnings after the bell on Thursday, reporting iPhone sales that missed analysts' expectations while **revenue fell 1.4% over last year, the third straight quarter of declines.** About half of the company's overall revenue comes from its iPhone segment.  
  
On Friday, Apple stock was down 2% in premarket trading, as the tech giants gloomy results contributed to it's share price decline.  
  
Revenue has slid for multiple quarters at the tech giant as Mac and iPad sales have flagged. On a call with analysts Apple CFO Luca Maestri said **the company expects revenue for these products to fall by double digits from last year**, citing pent-up demand from the prior year quarter after factory shutdowns.  
  
Services did better however my big question is if this really can compensate if Apple's hardware sales keep slumping? Quite frankly i don't understand why people keep buying the same iphone every year or maybe they no longer do? It's time Apple steps up its iphone and other hardware innovation instead of just repackaging the same thing every year with minor-to-no updates.

PS. anybody else would wanna see a macbook (pro) **with touchscreen**? Personally i love my Dell XPS 13 4K with touchscreen and love the dimensions are only 30x20cm. Would love to see Apple making something similar. ",436,156,1691147810.0,2023-08-04T11:16:50+00:00,t3_15hxac1,investing

154,DELL,XMTR – Cheap AI Stock. Great Upside Potential. This One’s Gonna Be Good.,"*I’m a selfish bastard, so I usually don’t give away my best ideas but fuck it I could use the karma. Besides, my wife is on vacation with her boyfriend, so I had a lot of time to myself to actually do some quality due-diligence on this stock.*

**The Headline**

Xometry (XMTR) is a massively underappreciated play on how AI is going to change manufacturing – and it’s pretty fuckin cheap right now.

**For Those of You Who Have a Fourth Grade Reading Level**

· XMTR connects the people who design shit with the people who can actually make that shit.

· They operate in a ~~$2,000,000,000,000~~ total addressable market.

· They use AI with better data than anyone else in the field (good moat).

· They have faced some short-term headwinds that have made the stock cheap (for now).

**The Business**

· XMTR has created a marketplace to connect product developers (NASA, BMW, Dell, SpaceX, you name it.) with manufacturers for custom parts manufacturing. This process used to be done through local connections, but, with XMTR's platform, this can be done much faster, cheaper, and at greater volume.

· They are doing this in a ginormous total addressable market sized at $2 trillion for global manufacturing where they only had revenue of $381 million for all of last year (but grew 75%!).

· XMTR is a newer company and in the early innings of user awareness where they have seen customers in industries from electric vehicle manufacturers, aerospace and defense, pharmaceuticals, consumer technology all grow spend at compounded annual growth rates between 121% up to 993%.

· Being the outright winner as a marketplace/having a first mover advantage is important as you can see with AirBnb, Amazon, and Uber who have won early to create significant value from digitizing their markets. Looking back, wouldn’t you have invested in Amazon at Day 1?

· This is playing out as competitors like [Fast Radius](https://3dprintingindustry.com/news/chicago-tech-company-fast-radius-files-for-chapter-11-after-the-spac-deal-216941/) and [Shapeway’s](https://3dprintingindustry.com/news/shapeways-hit-with-nyse-non-compliance-notice-for-failing-to-meet-listing-standards-214028/) have either gone bankrupt or are very close.

**AI &amp; Positive Feedback Loops**

· So, what’s the special sauce? [Artificial intelligence](https://chat.openai.com/) and machine learning. They continue to create a positive feedback loop where every buyer attracts more sellers and thus attracts more buyers. For those of you who haven't attended an intro to business webinar like I have, this phenomenon is called a network effect.

· This entire flywheel is powered by the droves of quality data they are collecting. Proper pricing, matching, and lead times between product developers and the 625,000 manufacturers in the USA alone is difficult and takes YEARS to develop since it has never been done before.

· While they have had some hiccups that hurt near term numbers and caused some bears to huddle up, they now have better data and algorithms than anyone else in the market and have better trained their machines which keeps competitors from coming anywhere close to competing with them. I love a good moat, don’t you?

*\*NOT TO MENTION\* there are 10,000 owners of manufacturing shops retiring and selling their businesses every day to engineers that understand and have a use for XMTR’s tech offering.*

**A Good Deal**

· NVIDIA (NVDA) is trading at 20x sales and XMTR is at \~ 2x sales. At 1/10th the price but growing 70% faster over the last 12 months, XMTR is the AI play of a century (wow!).

· Short interest ratio at 11% and moving upwards as bears are peaking their heads out of the forest to push this thing back up to 20% again.

· Their bearish sentiments are wrong, and we’ll be handsomely rewarded for our contrarianism.

37,DELL,ER Review for the Week of 5-29-23,"This week I was modeling earnings trades against 15 stocks: AMBA, AAP, CRM, CRWD, OKTA,CHWY, JWN, M, HRL, BILI, DG, ASAN, LULU, MDB, and DELL. Of those 15, 8 will neutral or winners, while 7 were losers. Right around 50%. However, the winners were strong winners. 

Essentially, if you had invested $2000 in a strangle for each, so a $30,000 investment ($2,000 x 15), your investment would now be worth $45,000, representing a 50% gain for the week. 

Top Winners  
MDB  ($2,000 -&gt; $9,000)  
AAP   ($2,000 -&gt; $8,600)  
DG     ($2,000 -&gt; $8,200)  
OKTA ($2,000 -&gt; $3,000)  


Max-Loss Losers:  
CRM  
M  
BILI  
DELL  


If you had been lucky enough to avoid those 4 max-loss losers, you would have realized nearly a 100% increase. However, that's just luck if you miss those but don't drop one of the top winners. This analysis assumes you sold at the proper time, and focused on the difference between the underlying's price and the strike price of the options. Actual options price will vary, such as gamma etc as we approach 0DTE.",0,0,1685804529.0,2023-06-03T15:02:09+00:00,t3_13zfgsn,options

156,DELL,$DELL will benefit immensely from the surge in AI adoption via their data center business,"Graduated from Baruch on Tuesday. Gives me street cred to go toe to toe with Shrkeli one day. Woo hoo 

https://www.dell.com/en-us/blog/dell-and-nvidia-bringing-generative-ai-to-the-enterprise/

$NVDA and $DELL are working together to bring generative AI to the enterprise market.

Essentially what this could mean for the earnings call after hours is that Dell could raise guidance in a crazy fashion the same way that NVDA did last week. While Dell’s business model has taken a hit due to the slump in the PC market… interest in new computing technologies that can support AI will help their business.

The stock dropped in symphony to legacy hardware company $HPE… most of their revenue is shitty printers that don’t work and lack luster PCs/Laptops..

Dell on the other hand has a better product lineup, owning Alienware and many other high performance PCs

https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/11/30/better-buy-dell-vs-hp/

According to this article, Dell has been investing in data centers significantly more aggressively than Hewlett-Packard…

As such, the shares seemed primed for a pop. Don’t expect PC sales to knock the results out of the park. They would have to essentially say AI 200 times. Jumping in at these levels.

* **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (log variance of daily gains) of the underlying asset and compare that to the current implied volatitlity (IV) of the option price. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium associated with the pricing of options (implied volatility).
* **Directional Bias:** Ranges from -100 (bearish) to +100 (bullish) and accounts for RSI, price trend, moving averages, and put/call skew over the past 6 weeks.
* **Priced Move:** given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move.
* **Expiration:** 2023-07-21.
* **Call/Put Premium:** How much extra you are paying for the implied move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean options are ""cheaper."" High numbers mean options are ""expensive.""
* **Efficiency:** This factor represents the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price of the option. It represents how much traders will pay in slippage with a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.
* **E.R.:** Days unitl the next Earnings Release. This feature is still in beta as we work on a more complete list of earnings dates.
* **Why isn't my stock on this list?** It doesn't have ""weeklies"", the underlying is ""too cheap"", or the options markets are too illiquid (open interest) to qualify for this strategy. 480 underlyings are used in this report and only the top results end up passing the criteria for each filter.",28,3,1685627693.0,2023-06-01T13:54:53+00:00,t3_13xi8c6,thetagang

* **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (log variance of daily gains) of the underlying asset and compare that to the current implied volatitlity (IV) of the option price. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium associated with the pricing of options (implied volatility).
* **Directional Bias:** Ranges from -100 (bearish) to +100 (bullish) and accounts for RSI, price trend, moving averages, and put/call skew over the past 6 weeks.
* **Priced Move:** given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move.
* **Expiration:** 2023-06-30.
* **Call/Put Premium:** How much extra you are paying for the implied move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean options are ""cheaper."" High numbers mean options are ""expensive.""
* **Efficiency:** This factor represents the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price of the option. It represents how much traders will pay in slippage with a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.

49,DELL,Total premium for CSP and CC?,"I'm primarily a futures trader, but have been reading a ton about options and the wheel strategy.

Apologies if this is too basic of a question, but I think I understand everything about the mechanics of the system except calculating the premium and closing positions.

A common piece of advice is to close out a position when 50-70% of the premium has been collected, but how is the premium calculated?  If selling a CSP for example, the premium isn't the credit received immediately upon selling the CSP?

For example, If I sold the 5/12 DELL weekly at 44 strike, the current bid is $0.05 and I would receive $5 credit.  Is the total premium $5, or how is it calculated?",7,10,1683557002.0,2023-05-08T14:43:22+00:00,t3_13bt6lx,thetagang

# [Stock futures slip as investors prepare for Fed meeting: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/01/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures fell slightly Tuesday as investors prepared for the Federal Reserve’s May policy meeting to kick off.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average pulled back by 74 points, or 0.2%. S&amp;P 500 futures traded 0.2% lower as well, and Nasdaq-100 futures fell marginally.
*****
&gt; The Fed’s two-day policy meeting is expected to conclude with the central bank announcing another 25 basis-point rate hike. Per the CME Group’s FedWatch tool, traders are pricing in 97% chance of a rate hike. Investors will be looking for clues on whether the Fed will keep rates steady after this meeting, or if it will further tighten monetary policy to fight inflation.
*****
&gt; “We think it will be the last rate hike of this tightening cycle,” wrote Joe Kalish, chief global macro strategist at Ned Davis Research. “The Fed, however, will want to preserve its optionality — just in case the economic data doesn’t come in as expected before the next FOMC meeting on June 13-14.
*****
&gt; The moves follow modest declines in the Monday’s session. The Dow and Nasdaq Composite both lost about 0.1%, while the S&amp;P 500 finished just slightly below its flatline.
*****
&gt; Investors were focused on the bank sector following the announcement that JPMorgan Chase won the weekend auction for troubled First Republic Bank. As part of the agreement, JPMorgan acquired all of the regional bank’s deposits and a “substantial majority of assets.” CEO Jamie Dimon said the deal should help end part of the industry crisis, which was initially prompted by the closure of Silicon Valley Bank in March.
*****
&gt; Weighing on sentiment was word from Treasury that the country may hit the debt ceiling sooner than expected. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned that the U.S. may run out of measures to pay its debts as early as June 1, earlier than the late July deadline Goldman was estimating.
*****
&gt; Wall Street will also will watch for data on job openings, factory orders and light vehicle sales on the economic front. Uber, Pfizer and Molson Coors are among companies set to report earnings before the bell, followed by Ford, Starbucks, Advanced Micro Devices and Caesars Entertainment after the market closes.

159,DELL,"Insider Trading Weekly Update #036: 6 Insiders at Intuitive Surgical Sell Combined ~$35M, Regional Banks Catch a Bid - Insider Trading Recap","GM WSB - 

TL;DR - Overall transaction activity is up slightly (+7%), while purchases ($9.4M / -3%) and sales ($484M / -66%)  are both down from the prior week. This is the second week in a row where we have not seen sizable bids in the data. Several weeks back, Buffett, Icahn, and several other 10% block owners were repeatedly at the top of the charts, raising total purchasing activity.

I found two other details of particular interest in this week’s review:

1. Insiders at regional banks represent the majority of purchasing activity. This seems odd, given the apparent calamity that First Republic Bank is in at the moment. Though perhaps they are banking (pun intended) for light at the end of the tunnel vis-a-vis a Fed bailout, should withdrawals persist.
2. $34.7M was sold by six insiders at Intuitive Surgical ($ISRG / Medical Instruments &amp; Supplies). We saw a similar pattern with Apple executives last week where $40M+ was sold. Once again, pretty sizable company (ISRG is a Large-Cap), and could very well be a non-blackout period for them to trade. But as you will see the percent change in shares is all quite high, so no way that it was going to be looked over for this week’s update.

# Notable sales from insiders:

* Blackstone Energy Management Associates, a 10% owner of Viper Energy ($VNOM / Oil &amp; Gas Midstream), sold 20.54% of their stake in a $54.3M sale on April 18th
* Richard Rothberg, General Counsel &amp; Secretary of Dell Technologies ($DELL / Computer Hardware), sold 57.36% of his stake in a $9.1M sale on April 18th
* Andrew Craig Miller, the COO of Karuna Therapeutics ($KRTX / Biotechnology), sold 73.89% of his stake in a $9M sale on April 18th
* Goran Skoko, an EVP of Research &amp; Advisory at Factset ($FDS / Financial Data &amp; Stock Exchanges), sold 64.68% of his shares in a $3.29M sale on April 17th
* Six insiders at Intuitive Surgical ($ISRG / Medical Instruments &amp; Supplies) sold shares on April 21st:
   * **David Rosa** (EVP &amp; Chief Strategy and Growth Officer) sold $24.3M (41.51% of stake)
   * **Myriam Curet** (EVP &amp; Chief Medical Officer), sold $2.8M (100% of stake)
   * **Robert Desantis** (EVP &amp; Chief Product Officer), sold $2.56M (74.26% of stake)
   * **Mark Rubash** (Director), sold $2.9M (-52.7% of stake)
   * **Craig Barratt** (Director), sold $1.78M (-100% of stake)
   * **Fredrik Widman** (VP, Corporate Controller), sold $187K (-22%)

# Notable buys from insiders:

* **Alan Colberg**, a Director at Us Bancorp ($USB / Banks - Regional), increased his stake by 20,000% in a $341K purchase on April 21st
* **John Donovan**, a Director at Lockheed Martin ($LMT / Aerospace &amp; Defense) increased his stake by 21.77% in a $250K purchase on April 19th

# High-Level Stats:

* Purchases decreased from $9.7M to $9.4M (-3%)
* Sales decreased from $1.4B to $484M (-66%)
* Transactions increased from 323 to 345 (+7%)
* Companies represented in Form 4s increased from 180 to 198 (+5%)
   * Net buyers increased from 17 to 21 (+24%)
   * Net sellers increased from 172 to 177 (+3%) 
* Insiders filing Form 4s increased from 275 to 307 (+12%)
   * Net buyers increased from 23 to 44 (+91%)
   * Net sellers increased from 252 to 263 (+4%)

# Transaction Selection

1. **All** **Open Market Transactions** from **April 17th - April 21st.** These are Form 4 filings with a Transaction Code of “P” or “S”. This narrows the scope to trades where insiders are putting their money on the line.
2. **Both indirect and direct** transactions are included in the reports.
3. Weekly comparisons are to transactions from **April 10th - April 14th.**
4. **No companies without a ticker**
5. No penny stocks or banned tickers.

# Further Context

1. Form 4 data is impacted by a concept known as **backfill** which is par for the course with transactional data. The delay between the Filing Date and the Transaction Date is **\*roughly\*** 2 days and your mileage will vary. This means that **more transactions for past dates can arrive in future filings.** That is why looking at larger trends is key.
2. To combat backfill, filings through this Tuesday are included **\*if\*** the transaction date is from the prior week. Otherwise, transactions from this week are excluded.
3. Data is sourced by the algorithms behind Form Fore

89,DELL,(4/17) Monday's Pre-Market Stock Movers &amp; News,"# Good Monday morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to the new trading week and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Monday, April 17th, 2023-

# [Stock futures are little changed as Wall Street awaits more earnings: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/16/stock-futures-climb-as-wall-street-awaits-more-bank-earnings-live-updates.html)
*****
&gt; Stock futures were flat Monday, with investors preparing for more quarterly earnings reports.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the S&amp;P 500 gained about 0.1%, while Nasdaq-100 futures traded flat. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures ticked up 58 points, or 0.17%.
*****
&gt; Charles Schwab is set to report earnings later in the day. The stock has been under pressure recently, as traders feared the brokerage may suffer a similar fate to regional banks Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. However, the company has defended its financial position, noting last month it has a low loan-to-deposit ratio. Schwab shares are down 39% year to date.
*****
&gt; Bank of America and Morgan Stanley are slated to report earnings Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively. Investors have been eyeing the overall health of the sector after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank last month spurred a liquidity crisis. Other notable names outside of financials, including electric vehicle heavyweight Tesla will report second-quarter earnings on Wednesday, while Procter &amp; Gamble reports on Friday.
*****
&gt; Corporate earnings got off to a positive start last week as banking giants Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase beat expectations. But discouraging retail sales data showed a slowdown in consumer spending by 1% in March pulled markets lower Friday.
*****
&gt; As companies grapple with sticky inflation and higher rates, many investors have braced for a downbeat earnings reports, but data from Bank of America suggests that this earnings reporting season may already be faring better than expected. Of the companies that reported during the first week, 90% topped EPS estimates. That marks the best beat rate to start earnings season since at least 2012, the Wall Street firm said.
*****
&gt; For the week, however, stocks remained resilient. The Dow was positive overall last week for the fourth straight time, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both had their fourth week in the green in five.

**Fed**

TLDR: May hike probability jumped to 72%; But more cuts are anticipated; overall good for stocks

After last Friday’s upbeat jobs report, May rate hike probability jumped to 72% however market is still pricing in 1-2 rate cuts this year.

[Market has been aggressively pricing in more cuts this year and next year due to downward surprises in macro-economic data \(which in part fueled the recently rally\).](https://preview.redd.it/e0somfyll4ta1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e7bf749a6fd4ec5d8a6b19683ef14287bcabf195)

**Business**

TLDR: US business under stress from low demand and refinancing difficulties; overall bad for stocks

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company said Monday that its revenue fell 15% in March from a year earlier, marking the first drop in nearly four years, suggesting softer than expected demand from downstream electronic companies (e.g. Apple etc). TSMC has slashed its capital spending plans for this year to a range of $32 billion to $36 billion, down from $36.3 billion last year, creating headwinds for upstream semiconductor suppliers. But the executives said that they expect the company’s sales in the first half to decline by a mid-to-high single-digit percentage in US dollar terms, but that business would pick up in the second half.

My current estimations:

Base case: earnings close to current estimation, however, inflation is stickier than expected, not Fed cut by year-end.

Bull case: earnings close to current estimation, however, inflation is down without large job loss; Fed hint cutting in 2024.

Bear case: earnings come in lower than expectation, however, inflation is still sticky, no Fed cut by year-end.

11,DELL,"Global PC shipments slide in Q1, Apple takes biggest hit - IDC","Global shipments of personal computers (PCs) fell by 29 per cent in the first quarter of 2023 due to weak demand, excess inventory and a deteriorating macroeconomic climate, with Apple Inc taking the largest hit, market research firm IDC said.

In the report published Sunday, the International Data Corporation (IDC) said global PC shipments numbered 56.9 million in the first quarter of this year, down from 80.2 million in the same period last year.

The shipments extended a similar year-on-year decline of 28.1 per cent in the last quarter of 2022.

Of the top five PC companies analysed in the report, Apple's Q1 shipments saw the largest drop of 40.5 per cent from the same period in 2022, with Dell Technologies Inc coming in second with a drop of 31 per cent.

Lenovo Group Ltd, Asustek Computer Inc and HP Inc also faced declines in shipments, the IDC said.

In February, Apple reported that sales of its Mac computers, which had boomed during the wave of working from home during the pandemic, declined 29 per cent YoY to $7.7 billion in their most recent quarter.

""The preliminary results also represented a coda to the era of COVID-driven demand and at least a temporary return to pre-COVID patterns. Shipment volume in Q1 2023 was noticeably lower than the 59.2 million units shipped in Q1 2019 and 60.6 million in Q1 2018,"" IDC said.

""The pause in growth and demand is also giving the supply chain some room to make changes as many factories begin to explore production options outside China.""

Concerns over slowdowns in major economies remain, with recent tumult in the banking sector exacerbating worries that runaway inflation and tight monetary policy would hamper growth and financial investments.

If the economy is trending upwards by 2024, ""we expect significant market upside as consumers look to refresh, schools seek to replace worn-down Chromebooks, and businesses move to Windows 11,"" said Linn Huang, research vice president, Devices and Displays at IDC.

""If recession in key markets drags on into next year, recovery could be a slog.""

# Transaction Selection

1. **All** **Open Market Transactions** from **March 27th - March 31st.** These are Form 4 filings with a Transaction Code of “P” or “S”. This narrows the scope to trades where insiders are putting their money on the line.
2. **Both indirect and direct** transactions are included in the reports.
3. Weekly comparisons are to transactions from **March 20th - March 24th.**
4. **No companies without a ticker**
5. No penny stocks or banned tickers.

# Further Context

1. Form 4 data is impacted by a concept known as **backfill** which is par for the course with transactional data. The delay between the Filing Date and the Transaction Date is **\*roughly\*** 2 days and your mileage will vary. This means that **more transactions for past dates can arrive in future filings.** That is why looking at larger trends is key.
2. To combat backfill, filings through this Tuesday are included **\*if\*** the transaction date is from the prior week. Otherwise, transactions from this week are excluded.
3. Data is sourced by algos behind[ Form Fore](http://formfore.io/)

162,DELL,AMD is going to Rock itself to 100 and beyond,"AMD is all set for a major jump to the 100s with every cloud vendor Google, Microsoft and Oracle writing FAT checks for the same.

This along with their supply to PC /Gaming lines is really adding to their topline and bottom-line respectively.

Strong market position: AMD has been gaining market share in both the CPU and GPU markets. Its Ryzen and EPYC processors have been well received by consumers and businesses, and its Radeon graphics cards have been competitive with Nvidia's offerings.

Ryzen processors introduced new levels of performance and value to the desktop CPU market, and its EPYC processors are making inroads in the server market. Good diversification of chips portfolio with CPUs and GPUs

One weakness is :  
AMD relies heavily on a few key customers, including Dell and HP, for a significant portion of its revenue. Losing one or more of these customers could be detrimental to its business.

Partnership opportunities: AMD has partnered with major players in the tech industry, including Microsoft and Google, to develop custom processors for their needs. More such partnerships could be in the company's future.

Competition: Intel and Nvidia are formidable competitors in the CPU and GPU markets, respectively. They have greater resources and established brands, which could make it difficult for AMD to gain market share.

90,DELL,Dell research and valuation,"# Executive Summary:

Dell has stable long-term prospects. They are a mature company. If they can tame their balance sheet, they would likely significantly increase their share price through returns to shareholders.  Another possibility is that they try to become private again because Michael Dell only took the company public to finance an acquisition. They are currently trading at a significant margin of safety between 11% (no growth) and 44% (10% growth).

# Introduction:

Dell provides businesses with IT solutions, ranging from traditional infrastructure, cloud infrastructure, hardware, and software. They also provide consultant-like solutions such as management and migratory support. They also have consumer-oriented businesses that offer off the shelf and custom to order PC’s. About half of their revenue is generated in the Americas. They have made a number of large acquisitions, notably EMC (cloud infrastructure/solutions), SecureWorks (IT security), and Virtuestream(Cloud ops). They have operations in 180 countries.

The business is organized into two operating segments, Infrastructure Solutions Group, and Client Solutions Group.

|Group|Client Solutions Group|Infrastructure Solutions Group|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Common functions|Branded hardware, peripherals, third party software support/deployment/configuration, warranties, customer service, financing, build to order.|Cloud Support, Cloud Services(Cloud Ops), Digital transformation&amp; related services, Multi Cloud integration, Cloud native workload solutions.|
|General Description|This includes their PC segment and legacy build to order hardware solutions. Through agreements, they also provide services related to third party software, mostly with integral software on their branded devices.|Offer cloud services, and support businesses adopting cloud services, retain them as customers after, provides reliable recurring revenue. Competes with AWS/Azure Enterprise services as well as infrastructure support providers, oriented towards large enterprise.|

# History:

Dell was founded by Michael Dell in 1984. They produce cell phones, computers, other hardware, and software, but used to do “build to order” enterprise infrastructure, which was especially popular in the internet bubble. Its two divisions are Dell client solutions group (CSG), and Dell infrastructure solutions group (EMC). Dell acquired EMC in 2015 for $67 billion, diversifying into the enterprise software and store industry. They bought Alienware in 2006. The company has traditionally been involved in the enterprise hardware business, specifically developing custom infrastructure. They have a focus on high performance PC’s and custom PC’s. If anything can be taken from their corporate history, it is that the company is not afraid to take dramatic actions to save its skin.

By the late 2000’s the company could not turn profits in the “make to order” business. They decided to shift towards off the shelf consumer and enterprise solutions. They were taken private in 2013 and went public again in 2018. VMWare was owned by EMC, and thus came under the control of Dell. Dell has decided to spin off VMWare, and there is a pending acquisition by Broadcom. The VMWare spinoff was completed in 2021. Michael Dell has been chairman since 1984, and apart from 2004-2007, has been CEO of the company. Kevin Rollins was CEO between 2004-2007, but Michael Dell decided to replace him after 5 quarters of disappointing results.

## Understanding Dell’s business segments:

Dell is organized into two segments. They are the Client Solutions Group and the Infrastructure Solutions Group.

ISG brought in $34 billion last year with $3.7 billion operating income. It accounts for 34% of their business. If we assume that this is mostly attributed to the EMC purchase, we can draw conclusions about the rational of the purchase by looking at current operating results. The return on investment is underwhelming but considering that Dell is in a mature stage of growth, it is positive that such a large investment will, at this rate, pay off in less than 20 years. At the current rate, it appears dell is looking at a long-term horizon of 18-20 years where EMC will have to prove its worth. It is hard to tell, but it is likely that Dell only went public for the second time to aid in the EMC acquisition.

|Year|Operating Income|ROI|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2020|$4.0B|6%|
|2021|$3.7B|5.5%|
|2022|$3.7B|5.5%|

ISG accounts for $14.7 billion of goodwill, a substantial amount obtained from the EMC purchase. In the MRQ, ISG brought in more operating income than CSG despite its significantly lower revenue, an attestation to the profitability Dell enjoys from the still lucrative enterprise solutions business.

They have been able to gradually increase revenue from servers and networking due to improvements in the configurations and technology available to customers.

In the server vendor industry, Dell is a significant player, second only to HPE in market share held by a single company. They have the largest market share in OEM storage systems. Dependence on cloud in the modern business drives growth in this segment. ISG capitalizes on hybrid cloud integrations, as well as public cloud support through hardware and software directly for CSP’s. This is a fast growing and profitable industry, and Dell’s positions as an infrastructure provider creates a barrier to exit for existing clients who integrate their infrastructure with Dell.

CSG brought in the majority of revenue at $61 billion, however it cannot attain the same level of profitability, netting $4.3 billion, still a substantial profit margin. They have $4.2 billion in goodwill. Dell ships the third most PC’s out of all vendors and has been able to keep their market share steady over the past decade. They are consistently able to raise prices in CSG, however they are subject to upstream price pressures, which would see margins significantly decrease in cool economic environments.

In CSG, there is significant competition among many market participants who are deeply entrenched in the industry. No single company has anything close to a majority. CSG is heavily exposed to international markets, especially Taiwan and China, however they have no supply chain exposure to Russia and Ukraine, and Russian/Ukrainian operations account for less than 1% of revenue.

# Segment industry comparison:

The industry average for PC vendors is an 18% average profit margin, well above the 7% Dell has in CSG, which is indicative of the price it pays for scale. They would have trouble improving this value to industry standards without relinquishing their 16.5% market share for a much smaller share, a clear indication of the competitiveness of this industry.

The industry average for cloud/cloud infrastructure providers is less than two percent. This number is slightly misleading, because seasoned providers like Dell, Azure, HPE, and Amazon are grouped together with Startup cloud companies. Among larger, more seasoned cloud infrastructure providers, average profit margins are closer to 14%. ISG’s profit margin is 11%.

# Financial performance:

The financial data only goes back to 2015, however we can look at the figures for Dell EMC from which the financial history for ISG can be inferred.

Dell EMC’s revenue only decreased 5.7% in 2009 but increased by 13.3% in 2010. Their revenue decreased 39% between 2000 and 2002. An implosion similar to the internet bubble would likely produce similar results over the short term, but this should be taken as a floor for shrinkage unless there is some five-sigma event that wreaks havoc in the industry. Profit decreased almost 60% in the same period. If the company has a shaky balance sheet, midterm decreases of 50% can threaten their existence. Given how the company has weathered previous economic downturns and depending on the widespread tech exposure to the economic trends, the company could see losses between 6%-40% in a recession but would not be threatened on the basis of their liquidity in CSG.

Revenue has been exceptional in the past two years. The revenue CAGR is about 12%. Net income was negative before 2019 but has been slightly positive since then.

The company has been teetering around zero equity. As of March second, 2023 (most recent financials), they had liabilities exceeding assets by about $3.03 billion, which is down from minus $1.5 billion the year before. They have a significant cash position of $8.6 billion. Their debt structure is very manageable and spread out over the next 20 years. They have an average of $1 billion a year due except for $4.5 billion due in 2026. 24% of their assets are goodwill, which is not unreasonable for the cash flow it can expect from enterprise clients in the future. If they can control their balance sheet, it would be viable for them to buy back shares. Michael Dell does not like relinquishing control of his company, so this may become reality in the future and he could take the company private.

The quarterly and annual results for 2022 indicate there are hard times to come. They averaged a 2.4% profit margin. Operating cash flows decreased over 60% YoY. Despite this, there has been solid growth in operating cash flows in the past decade due to favorable business conditions, and real growth in a mature client base. The operating cash flows will return when economic conditions ease. Capex has increased with opex, which is mostly attributable to the ISG segment maintenance and expansion.

# Valuation:

In projecting the FCF, we should have two sections, one for the next three years resembling the most recent downturn in financial results, and then for the remainder, returning to more normal financial conditions. We will go with a long-term growth rate equal to their growth in a zero rate environment (12.25%) minus the long term target rate of 2%, discounted by the company cost of capital (10%) plus a long term average risk free rate of 5%. Time horizon of 10 years. With this DCF, we arrive at an **intrinsic value of $38.89 billion**. They have a strong ability to generate cash, and do not have prohibitively high capex. Even with no growth, as long as they can hold their cash flows and keep interest and capex down, they would still be valued at $30 billion. However, there could be significant impairments on the company’s ability to generate cash and raise debt if they cannot get their balance sheet under control.",14,1,1678671322.0,2023-03-13T01:35:22+00:00,t3_11pwdcp,stocks

They are currently trading at a significant margin of safety between 11% (no growth) and 44% (10% growth).

# Introduction:

Dell provides businesses with IT solutions, ranging from traditional infrastructure, cloud infrastructure, hardware, and software. They also provide consultant-like solutions such as management and migratory support. They also have consumer-oriented businesses that offer off the shelf and custom to order PC’s. About half of their revenue is generated in the Americas. They have made a number of large acquisitions, notably EMC (cloud infrastructure/solutions), SecureWorks (IT security), and Virtuestream(Cloud ops). They have operations in 180 countries.

The business is organized into two operating segments, Infrastructure Solutions Group, and Client Solutions Group.

|Group|Client Solutions Group|Infrastructure Solutions Group|

|Common functions|Branded hardware, peripherals, third party software support/deployment/configuration, warranties, customer service, financing, build to order.|Cloud Support, Cloud Services(Cloud Ops), Digital transformation&amp; related services, Multi Cloud integration, Cloud native workload solutions.|
|General Description|This includes their PC segment and legacy build to order hardware solutions. Through agreements, they also provide services related to third party software, mostly with integral software on their branded devices.|Offer cloud services, and support businesses adopting cloud services, retain them as customers after, provides reliable recurring revenue. Competes with AWS/Azure Enterprise services as well as infrastructure support providers, oriented towards large enterprise.|

# History:

Dell was founded by Michael Dell in 1984. They produce cell phones, computers, other hardware, and software, but used to do “build to order” enterprise infrastructure, which was especially popular in the internet bubble. Its two divisions are Dell client solutions group (CSG), and Dell infrastructure solutions group (EMC). Dell acquired EMC in 2015 for $67 billion, diversifying into the enterprise software and store industry. They bought Alienware in 2006. The company has traditionally been involved in the enterprise hardware business, specifically developing custom infrastructure. They have a focus on high performance PC’s and custom PC’s. If anything can be taken from their corporate history, it is that the company is not afraid to take dramatic actions to save its skin.

By the late 2000’s the company could not turn profits in the “make to order” business. They decided to shift towards off the shelf consumer and enterprise solutions. They were taken private in 2013 and went public again in 2018. VMWare was owned by EMC, and thus came under the control of Dell. Dell has decided to spin off VMWare, and there is a pending acquisition by Broadcom. The VMWare spinoff was completed in 2021. Michael Dell has been chairman since 1984, and apart from 2004-2007, has been CEO of the company. Kevin Rollins was CEO between 2004-2007, but Michael Dell decided to replace him after 5 quarters of disappointing results.

## Understanding Dell’s business segments:

Dell is organized into two segments. They are the Client Solutions Group and the Infrastructure Solutions Group.

ISG brought in $34 billion last year with $3.7 billion operating income. It accounts for 34% of their business. If we assume that this is mostly attributed to the EMC purchase, we can draw conclusions about the rational of the purchase by looking at current operating results. The return on investment is underwhelming but considering that Dell is in a mature stage of growth, it is positive that such a large investment will, at this rate, pay off in less than 20 years. At the current rate, it appears dell is looking at a long-term horizon of 18-20 years where EMC will have to prove its worth. It is hard to tell, but it is likely that Dell only went public for the second time to aid in the EMC acquisition.

|Year|Operating Income|ROI|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2020|$4.0B|6%|
|2021|$3.7B|5.5%|
|2022|$3.7B|5.5%|

ISG accounts for $14.7 billion of goodwill, a substantial amount obtained from the EMC purchase. In the MRQ, ISG brought in more operating income than CSG despite its significantly lower revenue, an attestation to the profitability Dell enjoys from the still lucrative enterprise solutions business.

They have been able to gradually increase revenue from servers and networking due to improvements in the configurations and technology available to customers.

In the server vendor industry, Dell is a significant player, second only to HPE in market share held by a single company. They have the largest market share in OEM storage systems. Dependence on cloud in the modern business drives growth in this segment. ISG capitalizes on hybrid cloud integrations, as well as public cloud support through hardware and software directly for CSP’s. This is a fast growing and profitable industry, and Dell’s positions as an infrastructure provider creates a barrier to exit for existing clients who integrate their infrastructure with Dell.

CSG brought in the majority of revenue at $61 billion, however it cannot attain the same level of profitability, netting $4.3 billion, still a substantial profit margin. They have $4.2 billion in goodwill. Dell ships the third most PC’s out of all vendors and has been able to keep their market share steady over the past decade. They are consistently able to raise prices in CSG, however they are subject to upstream price pressures, which would see margins significantly decrease in cool economic environments.

In CSG, there is significant competition among many market participants who are deeply entrenched in the industry. No single company has anything close to a majority. CSG is heavily exposed to international markets, especially Taiwan and China, however they have no supply chain exposure to Russia and Ukraine, and Russian/Ukrainian operations account for less than 1% of revenue.

# Segment industry comparison:

The industry average for PC vendors is an 18% average profit margin, well above the 7% Dell has in CSG, which is indicative of the price it pays for scale. They would have trouble improving this value to industry standards without relinquishing their 16.5% market share for a much smaller share, a clear indication of the competitiveness of this industry.

The industry average for cloud/cloud infrastructure providers is less than two percent. This number is slightly misleading, because seasoned providers like Dell, Azure, HPE, and Amazon are grouped together with Startup cloud companies. Among larger, more seasoned cloud infrastructure providers, average profit margins are closer to 14%. ISG’s profit margin is 11%.

# Financial performance:

The financial data only goes back to 2015, however we can look at the figures for Dell EMC from which the financial history for ISG can be inferred.

Dell EMC’s revenue only decreased 5.7% in 2009 but increased by 13.3% in 2010. Their revenue decreased 39% between 2000 and 2002. An implosion similar to the internet bubble would likely produce similar results over the short term, but this should be taken as a floor for shrinkage unless there is some five-sigma event that wreaks havoc in the industry. Profit decreased almost 60% in the same period. If the company has a shaky balance sheet, midterm decreases of 50% can threaten their existence. Given how the company has weathered previous economic downturns and depending on the widespread tech exposure to the economic trends, the company could see losses between 6%-40% in a recession but would not be threatened on the basis of their liquidity in CSG.

Revenue has been exceptional in the past two years. The revenue CAGR is about 12%. Net income was negative before 2019 but has been slightly positive since then.

The company has been teetering around zero equity. As of March second, 2023 (most recent financials), they had liabilities exceeding assets by about $3.03 billion, which is down from minus $1.5 billion the year before. They have a significant cash position of $8.6 billion. Their debt structure is very manageable and spread out over the next 20 years. They have an average of $1 billion a year due except for $4.5 billion due in 2026. 24% of their assets are goodwill, which is not unreasonable for the cash flow it can expect from enterprise clients in the future. If they can control their balance sheet, it would be viable for them to buy back shares. Michael Dell does not like relinquishing control of his company, so this may become reality in the future and he could take the company private.

The quarterly and annual results for 2022 indicate there are hard times to come. They averaged a 2.4% profit margin. Operating cash flows decreased over 60% YoY. Despite this, there has been solid growth in operating cash flows in the past decade due to favorable business conditions, and real growth in a mature client base. The operating cash flows will return when economic conditions ease. Capex has increased with opex, which is mostly attributable to the ISG segment maintenance and expansion.

# Valuation:

In projecting the FCF, we should have two sections, one for the next three years resembling the most recent downturn in financial results, and then for the remainder, returning to more normal financial conditions. We will go with a long-term growth rate equal to their growth in a zero rate environment (12.25%) minus the long term target rate of 2%, discounted by the company cost of capital (10%) plus a long term average risk free rate of 5%. Time horizon of 10 years. With this DCF, we arrive at an **intrinsic value of $38.89 billion**. They have a strong ability to generate cash, and do not have prohibitively high capex. Even with no growth, as long as they can hold their cash flows and keep interest and capex down, they would still be valued at $30 billion. However, there could be significant impairments on the company’s ability to generate cash and raise debt if they cannot get their balance sheet under control.",3,3,1678671295.0,2023-03-13T01:34:55+00:00,t3_11pwcww,StockMarket

39,DELL,Last Week 3/6/23 Earnings Play,"This past week the only stock that met my criteria for an Earnings Play was $DOCU (Docusign). I acquired my positions on Monday (C66/P63) for $6.75. That put the break evens at $56 &amp; $73. For most of the week it traded with in a clearly defined range with resistance firmly placed at $66. I didn't trade the range in stocks, but it touched that line probably 5-8 times throughout the week and would drop down.

The day before earnings it was up to $66 and then would fall throughout the afternoon to around $64. Because of theta decay and literally no price movement I was down 20% going into earnings. After getting burned by $DELL the week before, I was prepared to actively manage the ER response. Once it popped up to $69 and started giving back gains, I shorted 200 shares, knowing my $66 call option was protecting me if it went against me. I rode it down $2 and sold to get some profit  (200 x $ 2 = $400). In hindsight I should have stayed in that all the way down.  

The next morning (premarket), when $DOCU hit $55 per share, I bought long 200 shares. I knew this limited my profit, but the week before I got burned by $DELL going on a run. $DOCU would continue to slide down to $51. After all the sales and purchases, I ended up locking in $700 in profit, which was a 46% profit).   


I was afraid of losing profit based on how the market has been moving the last couple weeks. If I had just let my straggle ride out and sold just prior to expiration I would have seen $1,250 in profit or +92%. Should have just let it ride out, but was a little worried about not locking in profit, my primary goal this week was to ease the 20% loss I took in $DELL the previous week.",16,4,1678546986.0,2023-03-11T15:03:06+00:00,t3_11ombu5,options

#[Stock futures climb on Friday as S&amp;P 500 tries to snap 3-week losing streak: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/02/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures rose Friday as investors pondered the Federal Reserve’s rate-hiking path in light of fresh commentary from central bank speakers.
*****
&gt; Nasdaq-100 futures were up 0.3%, and S&amp;P 500 futures advanced 0.2%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were up 33 points.
*****
&gt; Those moves come as U.S. Treasury yields retreated. The benchmark 10-year yield fell more than 6 basis points to 4%. The 2-year rate dipped to 4.855%.
*****
&gt; The major averages are on their way to a positive week. The S&amp;P 500 is up 0.28%, on pace to snap a three-week decline, while the Nasdaq has a 0.6% gain. The Dow is also up 0.6% on the week.
*****
&gt; The Dow on Thursday had its best day since Feb. 13, closing 1.1% higher. The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.8%, and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.7%. These gains came after Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said that he thinks the central bank can keep its interest rate hikes to 25 basis points rather than the half-point increase favored by some other officials.
*****
&gt; However, Fed Governor Christopher J. Waller struck a tougher tone in his comments to the Mid-Size Bank Coalition of America, raising the possibility of a higher terminal rate if inflation numbers don’t cool.
*****
&gt; He referred to January’s big payrolls report, which showed the economy added 517,000 jobs, as well as the latest reading from the consumer price index and personal consumption expenditures reports.
*****
&gt; “If those data reports continue to come in too hot, the policy target range will have to be raised this year even more to ensure that we do not lose the momentum that was in place before the data for January were released,” Waller said.
*****
&gt; The road ahead is a tough one for the central bank, regardless of the messaging they’re relaying to the public.
*****
&gt; “No matter how slow the Fed goes, no matter how much they ‘communicate’ what they want to do, there is no avoiding the potholes of reversing extraordinary easing,” Bleakley chief investment officer Peter Boockvar wrote in a note.
*****
&gt; “When markets and the economy have been addicted and medicated for so long on low rates and QE, there will never be the right time to ease up,” he said.
*****
&gt; On the economic data front, the Institute of Supply Management is due to release its Non-Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) report on Friday morning. Investors will also listen for further commentary from central bank officials, including Fed Governor Michelle Bowman and Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin.

#[Stock futures climb on Friday as S&amp;P 500 tries to snap 3-week losing streak: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/02/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures rose Friday as investors pondered the Federal Reserve’s rate-hiking path in light of fresh commentary from central bank speakers.
*****
&gt; Nasdaq-100 futures were up 0.3%, and S&amp;P 500 futures advanced 0.2%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were up 33 points.
*****
&gt; Those moves come as U.S. Treasury yields retreated. The benchmark 10-year yield fell more than 6 basis points to 4%. The 2-year rate dipped to 4.855%.
*****
&gt; The major averages are on their way to a positive week. The S&amp;P 500 is up 0.28%, on pace to snap a three-week decline, while the Nasdaq has a 0.6% gain. The Dow is also up 0.6% on the week.
*****
&gt; The Dow on Thursday had its best day since Feb. 13, closing 1.1% higher. The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.8%, and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.7%. These gains came after Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said that he thinks the central bank can keep its interest rate hikes to 25 basis points rather than the half-point increase favored by some other officials.
*****
&gt; However, Fed Governor Christopher J. Waller struck a tougher tone in his comments to the Mid-Size Bank Coalition of America, raising the possibility of a higher terminal rate if inflation numbers don’t cool.
*****
&gt; He referred to January’s big payrolls report, which showed the economy added 517,000 jobs, as well as the latest reading from the consumer price index and personal consumption expenditures reports.
*****
&gt; “If those data reports continue to come in too hot, the policy target range will have to be raised this year even more to ensure that we do not lose the momentum that was in place before the data for January were released,” Waller said.
*****
&gt; The road ahead is a tough one for the central bank, regardless of the messaging they’re relaying to the public.
*****
&gt; “No matter how slow the Fed goes, no matter how much they ‘communicate’ what they want to do, there is no avoiding the potholes of reversing extraordinary easing,” Bleakley chief investment officer Peter Boockvar wrote in a note.
*****
&gt; “When markets and the economy have been addicted and medicated for so long on low rates and QE, there will never be the right time to ease up,” he said.
*****
&gt; On the economic data front, the Institute of Supply Management is due to release its Non-Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) report on Friday morning. Investors will also listen for further commentary from central bank officials, including Fed Governor Michelle Bowman and Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin.

40,DELL,$DELL ER ... so close,"My play this week was around $DELL for earnings. I went with a strangle (C42/P40.5). My entrance was at $1.86 on Monday with 8 contracts each way for a total investment of $1490.

The stock stock continued to trend down prior to earnings. I sold the PUT option and got $1200 back. Leaving just under $290 to break-even. I felt that this pattern is decreasing stock price and low expectations usually gives the opportunity for a rise following  ER. 

Initially after ER, the stock popped up to arond $42.75. I wanted to protect my profits but give it some room to run, but went too high and set a sell short order for $44. The stock never got that high and then would crash all the way back down to $39. If I had just accepted a break even, and set the sell short order at $42, that would have given a profit of $2400 on the decline. 

Earnings accross the board this week produced minimal stock movement. Losing $300 seems acceptable on a week like this. The best earnings play this week had to be Salesforce $CRM. $OKTA wasn't a great plan, but could have been profitable

51,DELL,Long Volatility Options Trade for DELL Earnings: Straddle vs Iron Condor,"*tldr: DELL is a volatile stock around earnings, I study past earnings moves numbers and calibrate a long volatility non-directional position looking at break-evens and projected P&amp;Ls.*

This week I looked at DELL as a possible play for their earnings releasing Wednesday after close. My usual approach is to start by comparing the stock move on past earnings versus current expected move then look at some positions.

https://preview.redd.it/zzq1mrgom8la1.png?width=2404&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=621d4e34d93424dc3f200aa61abe748f189b15c8

# Past Earnings Moves

A good first step is to start by looking at past earnings moves for the stock.

Let's start with the main numbers:

&gt;***Average post move***: **+/-7.2%**  
&gt;  
&gt;***Std deviation***: **4.6%**

Standard deviation is a measure of the dispersion of a set of values.

A quick approximation is that most values are as low as average minus this, and as high as average plus this.

**⇒ DELL moves between +/-2% and +/-13% on its earnings around 70% of the time.**

We can refine these numbers by looking at the breakdown of these past moves:

https://preview.redd.it/fgt5szgtm8la1.png?width=2032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b995b470dc6fe6c49ec2bcfd384648c07d9e2275

Every line is a past earnings of DELL showing data about that release date. We see the average and standard deviation calculated on those date.

&gt;**⇒ We can assess that 7.2% average and 4.6% std dev stayed grew slowly over the last two years from around \~5%**

For every date we have the pre-release / day-of-release / post-release actual moves, this time not absolute. Pre / Post moves are highest recorded move leading to / after the release by one day.

Highlighted rows are dates where the move on day of release exceeded the past average value.

&gt;**⇒ We see since 2018, the highest move recorded was +18% on 2020-05-26.**

We can assess if these dates correspond to perhaps other events that pushed those moves as outliers or whether the stock is more unpredictable on when its spikes on earnings.

A good way of investigating this is looking at histograms charts:

https://preview.redd.it/ot3hs6z2n8la1.png?width=1026&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1059c1722109e0a368bff5fc27c972e26ac8abbc

This a distribution of the past moves we were looking at. The x axis is the value of the move and the y axis is how many it occurred, *so spikes correspond to the highest occurrences*.

&gt;**Most historic moves are concentrated between -9 and +10, with however many occurrences of peaks at +13% and 18% and drops lower than -13%**  
&gt;  
&gt;**=&gt; overall a very volatile stock on earnings**

Given these informations, we can start looking at possible plays for betting on the stock moving higher than the past average of +/-7% as this is a volatile stock on earnings - if we can find a suitable trade in terms of break-even.

***One thing to always keep in mind is the IV crush: implied volatility rises in the days leading to the earnings release which makes holding options positions through earnings risky where I.V drops significantly right after the release, inflicting a high loss on long options positions if the stock price does not exceed the implied move.***

Stock price at the time of this write-up is 40.4$, near close Wednesday , so closest strikes are the $40 and $40.5 for the closest expiration of 03-03.

# Straddle: DELL 03-03 40.5p 40.5c

https://preview.redd.it/tfvhj3ovq8la1.png?width=342&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8512465bcb6f2b857d80a4b169a392419615ea77

We see the straddle costs $2.6 per contract and is showing a small delta of 0.03 and a gamma of 0.28: this position is non-directional, meaning it gets affected in the same way wether the stock moves up or down. Gamma shows us how *fast* that reaction is.

Looking at IV, the call IV is 84% vs 95% for the put.

**These values of IV are not informative on their own: they need to be compared to historic IV around earnings, and more importantly, we need to know how they will impact any position when IV drops after earnings. This translates into the break-even of the position and its p&amp;l for different scenarios of stock moves, and that's what we will be looking into.**

This is the position break-even, calculated for exactly Thursday, taking into account the drop of IV for this position from 88% to 54%:

https://preview.redd.it/86p7qi7ur8la1.png?width=2056&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=627b93067e6647d03d24cfb1cbae498480b4b896

&gt;**Break-even**: **-5.7% +6%**

This is a bit lower than the average historic move of +/-7% which is actually favorable for us.

**Worst case scenario of no stock move will yield a -76% loss by mid day Friday:**

https://preview.redd.it/hfw0po80s8la1.png?width=3018&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f2f2cfdfce924799e7fdf7f5e162cf5b8e56c76

# We can better estimate maximum profit and loss

Let's look at P&amp;Ls for minimum and maximum historic moves from the analysis earlier.

&gt;**Minimum move of +/-1% =&gt; P&amp;L: -70%**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Average move of +/-7% =&gt; P&amp;L: +25%**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Maximum move of +/-13% =&gt; P&amp;L: +130%**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Moonshot move of +/-18% =&gt; P&amp;L: +220%**

*This can be used to calibrate stop-loss and take-profit thresholds with some margin:*

**Aggressive** (willing to hold for maximum move even through no move at the beginning)

Take-profit: +130% | Stop-Loss: -90%

**Mild** (happy with just an average past move, and cutting it if the move is a bit over the minimum)

Take-profit: 20% | Stop-Loss: -70%

**A good practice is to not activate the stop less in the first hour to give the market time to react, then we either exit at stop loss or take profit,** we are ready for the potential loss so might as well give ourselves more room since most of the loss will occur at open.

Let's see if we can lower the potential loss of 70% and perhaps our break-even too by selling some out-of-money legs.

# Iron Condor: DELL 03-03 long 40.5p 40.c short 39p 42p

Break-even is now lower at -2.5% +3%  which is lower than the average historic of +/-7%, and **we lowered our potential loss to -45%**, but on the other hands we also reduced **our potential gains which are capped to 55% for this condor.**

Zoom on Tuesday announced plans to cut about 1,300 workers, or 15% of its workforce, according to a blog post shared to the company’s website.

Shares of Zoom were up about 6% Tuesday.

CEO Eric Yuan wrote in the blog post that as the world continues to adjust to life after the pandemic, the company needs to adapt to the “uncertainty of the global economy” as well as “its effect on our customers.”

Zoom experienced a huge boom during the pandemic when people were forced to work from home and turned to video chat software to stay in touch with colleagues, friends and family.

“We worked tirelessly and made Zoom better for our customers and users. But we also made mistakes,” Yuan said. “We didn’t take as much time as we should have to thoroughly analyze our teams or assess if we were growing sustainably, toward the highest priorities.” 

Yuan said the cuts will impact every organization across Zoom, and employees will be offered up to 16 weeks of salary and healthcare coverage. Yuan also said he plans to reduce his own salary for the coming fiscal year by 98%, and he is also foregoing is 2023 corporate bonuses.

“As the CEO and founder of Zoom, I am accountable for these mistakes and the actions we take today– and I want to show accountability not just in words but in my own actions,” he wrote in the post.

&gt; “On average, new bull markets launched when stocks were 25% undervalued,” he said. “At current valuation, the S&amp;P 500 would need to fall below 3,500 just to reach fair value; a decline to 25% undervaluation would see the S&amp;P 500 fall near to its Covid-low of 2,200.”

93,DELL,Why this is a weird time and the market is erratic and volatile,"In a nutshell, I've come up with the following assessment based on my research that isn't calling a bottom or anything but is driving my investment strategy.  


Since 2009, the market has been driven more by the Federal Reserve Fund Rate (FFR) that enabled a lot of companies to grow, particularly in the tech industries, due to easy debt availability.  The FFR was negative in real terms (in relationship to true inflation rates) and off-shoring allowed for easy access to cheap labor on staples and manufacturing.  This allowed wages to be suppressed, even in non-staple industries.  An example is why your support phone calls to Dell are taken in Mumbai.  The CSR's are getting paid fractions of what US CSR's would receive for the same work.  


The COVID shut downs of 2020 came with unemployment at 3.5% leading into it.  However, there was stagnant wage growth at that time.  For reference sake, average unemployment from 1948 until 2015 was 5.8%.  The Federal Reserve targets 5% unemployment as its target.  Above that isn't necessarily healthy because it leaves companies short staffed and doesn't allow for wage growth in-line with the Fed's target inflation rate of 2.5%.  Since wages were not increasing at a rate commiserate with inflation in real terms and because social security payouts were so low as well in terms of pre-70 retirements, older folks were working longer.  Then along came COVID.  


COVID-based lockdowns caused massive layoffs, to the tune of a 12-13% spike in unemployment.  The US went from 3.5% to 14.7% unemployment basically in the course of weeks.  The easing of the lockdowns took over a year.  The Federal Reserve and Congress' response was to dump a ton of money in enhanced unemployment benefits, drop nominal rates to zero, and juice the stock market from a massive drop into a blow-off top with the S&amp;P hitting 4800.  Suddenly, a lot of 60+ year old's retirement accounts got a lot more valuable.  There was a lot of incentive to stop working for a lot of people who historically would have been out of the workforce 5-10 years earlier.  This is tied to a demographic issue based on lower birth rates tied to stagnant wage growth, higher debt levels, and higher quality of life and fundamental shifts in how people chose to live life.  


In lockstep, the outsourced staples and manufacturing had inflation problems because the labor issues spread globally as entire continents locked down.  The entire global supply chain got, for lack of a better term, FUBAR'ed.  This jacked shipping, production, and commodity prices, on top of what had been developing upward pressure on those prices due to global climate concerns.  This caused inflation which is still manifesting.  


Historically, inflation can't be tamed until the FFR is positive in real terms (rates above inflation rate).  We aren't there yet, but should get there by Q1 of '23.  History says a ""soft landing"" is not likely because the very thing the Fed has to do to tame inflation is recessionary.  Unemployment has to go up.  And that's the crux of why I am writing this:  
We're in a weird time, because unemployment isn't likely to give much of a care about rates.  Simply put, the available labor force has contracted dramatically.  And this isn't really tracked well.  In '20-'21 there were massive spikes in new company registrations, so a lot of people left the workforce to start their own little gigs, likely in many cases with zero rate debt for startup costs, and those likely aren't being tracked that well.  The stock market, which is essentially all very large companies, feels this strain the worst, because the only way they are going to keep up is by offering higher wages from the bottom to the top of their employment pay scales.  We will likely see continuing white-collar job cuts and continuing pay and benefit raises at the bottom, which vastly out number the top.  There is very little incentive these companies can provide without higher pay.  And no Fed changes will help this.  The job market is going to persist at a very tight state, the demographics demand it.  


All that will happen is that the Fed will tighten, even into real positive rates of 6-7%, and eventually the issue will be servicing US debt as a percentage of GDP.  It will hit a point, stop, and the pivot won't happen for a very long time back into easy monetary policy because the stagnation of the labor pool and avenues for self-employment contradict the large corporate structure that has existed to this point.  My personal investment thesis right now is to maintain exposure in solid, mature companies, preferably with dividends, emerging market exposure into places with positive demographic trends (India, South Africa), and buy bonds when the fed announces a stop to rate hikes because I think they will largely outperform the market in the 2-5 year term until the pivot to rate cuts (probably 2H 2024) due to political pressure and the ever increasing appetite by the general populace for entitlements.  
At that point, buying TLT will be how somebody could get very, very wealthy and since that is not some secret anymore, that could re-ignite the entire cycle.  Because it will happen at that scale.  Institutional money will absolutely clobber that trade.",79,37,1670337968.0,2022-12-06T14:46:08+00:00,t3_ze8l4d,stocks

# [Stock futures are slightly higher as investors look ahead to Fed meeting minutes](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/22/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures were marginally higher on Wednesday morning, as investors looked ahead to Federal Reserve meeting minutes for clues into the pace of future interest rate hikes.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures added 20 points points, or 0.1. S&amp;P 500 futures also gained 0.1% along with Nasdaq 100 futures.
*****
&gt; Shares of Nordstrom fell more than 8% in the premarket after the department store chain reaffirmed its forecast. However, Nordstrom beat profit and sales expectations in its latest results, according to consensus expectations on Refinitiv.
*****
&gt; Wall Street is coming off an upbeat session, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average surging nearly 400 points Tuesday. The S&amp;P 500 rose 1.36%, closing above the 4,000 level for the first time since September. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.36%.
*****
&gt; Investors shrugged off fears of further lockdowns in China after the country reported its first Covid deaths since May. Instead, traders focused on some strong earnings reports, and bet on the likelihood for an easing in monetary policy from the Fed going forward.
*****
&gt; “Investor psychology remaining optimistic is driving the rally in this market,” Eugene Profit, CEO at Profit Investments, said Tuesday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.”
*****
&gt; “Going into the next Fed meeting, I think the Fed will probably moderate their language a little bit, and I think investors want to remain optimistic, and ignore a lot of headwinds in this market,” he added.
*****
&gt; On the economic front, investors will review the latest Fed meeting minutes on Wednesday for insight into the central bank’s approach on monetary policy ahead of the December meeting.
*****
&gt; Earlier in November, the central bank approved a fourth consecutive 0.75 percentage point hike that brought rates to their highest level since 2008. Economists are forecasting a half percentage point increase in December, and smaller rate hikes next year.
*****
&gt; Additionally, investors will parse through the latest jobless claims data. Economists polled by Dow Jones are forecasting claims of 225,000 for the week ending Nov. 19, a slight increase from the 222,000 initial claims the prior week.
*****
&gt; They’re also expecting the latest data on durable goods and new home sales in October. Durable goods in October are expected to have risen 0.5% from the prior month, according to estimates from Dow Jones.
*****
&gt; Markets will be closed on Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday and will close early on Friday.

169,DELL,"My Full Plan for this Week 11/21 + Challenge Update (3 Earnings Plays, 1 MAJOR Economic Event , 4 Stocks)","Hello ladies and gentlemen

I'm ash and write detailed DD on stocks and events, so last week I published my Full plan and analysis.In this post, we will cover

* This week’s Earnings
* This Week's Major Economic Events
* This week’s Watchlist
* This Week’s lotto 10 bagger Play

**$2k to $100k Challenge Update**

Last week was an OK week, earnings did what earnings do best and didn't move as per numbers that came out, sometimes for our benefit sometimes against us, for the most part, the market chopped for a full week.

For Earnings we had NVDA, HD, and BABA, NVDA misses but ran a little and then died by open, IV crush got the best of the puts, and BABA puts also fared the same way, even though we were wrong BABA died despite beating earnings but not enough. HD is more of the same, not a big move on earnings. Lots of chop and IV crush killed the puts. Got out of these with a small loss at the open. Not a great week for earnings plays.

Our 10x Play did great though, DWAC was a sell-the-news situation and died even after the trump announcement, and hit our target of $21 and it was 300%+ play, not 10x but ill take it.

For those who don't know, I'm 31 trading days in a challenge where I trade live every day, starting with $2k (actually $1.8k) and trade my way to $100k, live in front of everyone every day.

**Options Starting Amount:** $1000**Day 27 Closing Amount:** $10,014**Port % Change:** 1001%

**Futures/Commodities Starting Amount:** $800**Day 27 Closing Amount:** $1918**Port % Change**: 102%

We are down $300ish this week, honestly not bad at all, its been awhile since i had a red week,ill take down $300 for a red week, any day every day. Its not as bad it seems, i currently have

* AMD 03/17/2023 75.00 C
* AFRM 01/20/2023 17.50 C
* COIN 01/20/2023 55.00 C
* NFLX 12/30/2022 330.00 C
* TQQQ 12/09/2022 22.50 C
* SPXW 12/06/2022 4100.00 C
* TSLA 11/25/2022 180.00 C
* TWST 04/21/2023 25.00 P

And plenty of cash, some of these are down a little so they pulled the account value down, i got alot of time on most of these. As the account grows im looking to do more swings than daytrades. Im overly long so i will likely add some short expsourse to hedge/balance the account a bit.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

This is a very short and uneventful week i almost didnt put out the watchlist, but its important to know whats going on.

We got thanksgiving on Thursday (Happy thanksgiving everyone!) and Friday trading ends 1pm because of  Black Friday, most institutions and traders will likely be taking a long weekend, so its a 3 day week pretty much.

# Major Economic Events

**Wednesday 11/09**

8:30 AM Durable Goods Orders MoM Oct9:45 AM S&amp;P PMI Flash Nov2:00 PM FOMC Minutes

As i said very slow week, nothing much we can play off, FOMC minutes might give the market a little pump but nothing worth playing, will be good to see what was said behind closed doors, might give us a play off that, but likely nothing.

# Earnings

# Monday 21 Nov

**After Close - Zoom Video Communications ($ZM)**

* Technology Services
* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 4:05 pm EST
* Estimates: EPS $0.832 &amp; Revenue $1.09B
* Options pricing in a 15.6% move on earnings
* My Play: Flow is slightly bearish but its important to note they never missed earnings since inception, its usually the guidance that kills them, i dont understand why ZM is a 25B company, going with flow on this on one, puts.

# Tue 22 Nov

**Before Open - Best Buy Co, Inc ($BBY)**

* Retail Trade
* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 8:05 am EST
* Estimates: EPS $1.032 &amp; Revenue $10.3B
* Options pricing in a 11% move on earnings
* My Play: With most of retail beating and very bullish options chains, im bullish on this one, will be selling BBY 2022-11-25 P $69.00, you can also take calls if you dont want to sell options, with IV too high, id rather sell

# Wed 22 Nov

**Before Open - Deere &amp; Company ($DE)**

* Industrial
* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 8:00 am EST
* Estimates: EPS $7.12 &amp; Revenue $13.5B
* Options pricing in a 6.7% move on earnings
* My Play: Flow pretty bearish on this one, will go with puts here, makes sense with latest CPI numbers out.

Other notable earnings this week: $DELL $DLTR $HPE

# Watchlist

**- NFLX Long**

Right at 21MA on the daily chart and with a gap up to fill, i already have a position 12/30 Calls but you dont need to go so far out 2-3 weeks should be ok

https://preview.redd.it/5b822iml471a1.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe7ca2769c4f20251ab7413e26ee0305c6452ee9

**- META Long**

Holding the 21MA on the daily after multiple tests and in middle of a gap fill to $124, will also be taking 2-3 weeks out swing on this

https://preview.redd.it/se5xtv8m471a1.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a49615a9f7b4f176a5517366fb5f1fde90cb3ec6

**- TSLA Long/Short**

At major Support that has held 3 times so far, making it possibly weak here, if this level holds we get a a double bottom and likely move back to 200s, if not we will go back 150, watch for a retest and break/fail before entering

https://preview.redd.it/04ud0cwm471a1.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e7d0bb3d61d723824c57302a3b727410c5560c5

**- COIN Long**

Crypto taking hits left and right and new scandals coming out everyday, as we approach $41 coin becomes more appealing, will be slowly building a position here for when things calm down and COIN rebounds, looking at Jan-Feb Calls

https://preview.redd.it/gs9pibln471a1.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9c67c9f39558996148549530fec9a8ca90d2fbb

**Bonus Potential 10 Bagger Play**

No 10x as this is a short week, not enough time for any plays i have to play out, i would say maybe short GBTC but everything out there is circumstantial so far, but actually be a long. So yeah nothing this week.

Alright, so that's it for this week, ill be doing this every week and going through the previous week’s play to see how much we gained and where we went wrong.

If you have any questions let me know, none of this is financial advice.

I wish you all a very green week!",48,25,1668989510.0,2022-11-21T00:11:50+00:00,t3_z0jw08,wallstreetbets

# **S&amp;P 500 closes higher on Friday, but ends week with losses - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/17/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)**
*****
&gt; The major averages ticked higher in afternoon trading Friday to end the day on an upbeat note as investors assessed tougher language from Federal Reserve speakers and pored over the latest earnings reports.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 199.37 points, or 0.59%, to 33,745.69, while the S&amp;P 500 climbed 0.48% to 3,965.34. The Nasdaq Composite finished just 0.01% above the flat line at 11,146.06.
*****
&gt; All of the major averages posted losses for the week. The Dow ended 0.01% lower. The S&amp;P 500 lost 0.69% for the week, while the Nasdaq ended 1.57% lower. All three indexes are positive for the month, however.
*****
&gt; The market was divided for much of the day, with the S&amp;P 500 trading mostly flat as investors started to reset expectations after a couple of rallies over the past week, beginning with the October CPI print. Stephanie Lang, chief investment officer at Homrich Berg, said this week is characterized by a “back-to-reality viewpoint.”
*****
&gt; “Following the big rally coming off the better-than-expected CPI print, the market’s digesting the current data, which is bringing things back to reality,” she said. “The rally that followed the CPI print we don’t feel was justified by fundamentals… The market’s also pricing in a soft landing here, which we don’t think is likely to occur. So when you hear the Fed officials coming out and reiterating their stance, you’re starting to see the market readjust to that.”
*****
&gt; On Friday, Boston Federal Reserve President Susan Collins expressed confidence that policymakers can tame inflation without doing too much damage to employment.
*****
&gt; St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said Thursday that “the policy rate is not yet in a zone that may be considered sufficiently restrictive.” He suggested that the appropriate zone for the federal funds rate could be in the 5% to 7% range, which is higher than what the market is pricing.
*****
&gt; ""We continue to think investors should place much more emphasis on the actual data and not focus too much on Fed rhetoric (the former will show where inflation is headed while the latter is fixated on where it was),” said Adam Crisafulli, founder of Vital Knowledge. “That said, investors are tired of battling the Fed’s daily tape bombs and the fear is it may take 2-3 more CPIs for officials to stop admonishing the market every time it tries to rally.”

&gt; # Do Stocks Really Like Gridlock?

&gt; The midterm elections are over, and the results aren’t 100% official yet, but we do know that we’ll have a divided government. As of now, the Democrats have 50 seats in the Senate to maintain control there, while the Republicans gained their 218th seat in the House to take control there. The bottom line though is neither the Senate nor the House has large majorities, in fact, they are both near historically small margins.

&gt; So that’s the big question, do stocks really like gridlock? Of course, things are never this simple, as there are so many other factors that matter to how stocks do, but it sure looks like gridlock could be a tailwind for stocks. Or at the very least, not a major headwind.

&gt; Here’s a chart that shows all the times since 1950 we’ve had a divided government and how the S&amp;P 500 did in those years. The average return for stocks was a very solid 15.7% under a divided government, with only one-year falling significantly back in 1981, while 2011 was nearly exactly breakeven. The other years saw some solid returns.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Blog-176-800x297.png))**

&gt; As of now, it is expected the Republicans will take a three-seat majority in the House (this could change, but it’ll likely be near this number). This would be the smallest majority for the Republicans since 3 seats in 2001 and 2002. Here’s a great chart that shows just how rare it is to have a majority this small. Fun stat, the House moved to 435 seats in 1913, meaning 218 seats gives a party the majority. Fun stat #2, the Democrats controlled the House from 1955 to 1994, but things have been more even over recent years.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/blog-2-800x357.png))**

&gt; What exactly does a small-seat majority in the House mean? Odds are a small majority means there could be some gridlock, so do stocks like this? Below we show again this appears to be the case. When there is less than a 20-seat House majority, the S&amp;P 500 gained a median of 19.5% and was higher 12 out of 15 times when looking at the first year of a new Congress. In fact, 9 of the past 10 times there was a new Congress and a small majority, stocks finished higher.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/blog-3-800x485.png))**

&gt; In conclusion, stocks really do appear to have no issues with a divided government and in many cases, stocks have done just fine under this scenario.

&gt; # Weakness Sets Up Bullish Thanksgiving Week/End-November Trade

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/983481ddc26e9faf09d4cbe60d182136/4dd2ef76a33815cb-d4/s500x750/221168352745363465f01d3a3261a2773c0690ab.jpg))**

&gt; The recent 21-year typical November graph here points to a seasonal cycle low point tomorrow, the 14th trading day of the month, the Friday before Thanksgiving and Op-Ex day. Thanksgiving week has a notorious “holiday fueled” bullish bias as do the last seven trading days of the month.

&gt; However, as you can see from the tables here of the history of the Thanksgiving trade the bullish bias has weakened over the last several years. The best short-term trade appears to be getting long into any weakness in the week or days before the holiday and selling any subsequent rally toward the end of Thanksgiving week or before month-end.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/afaf374bbaec07b073fabd03723ff324/4dd2ef76a33815cb-44/s500x750/bd219c6246d1918c7fc0bcee7ae9be9dd623cb64.jpg))**

&gt; First published in the 1987 Stock Trader’s Almanac, the Wednesday before and the Friday after Thanksgiving combined were up 34 times in 35 years. The only S&amp;P 500 decline was in 1964. Subsequently, this trend changed. In the 35 years since 1987, there have been 10 declines and 25 advances. See 2023 Stock Trader’s Almanac page 106 for more.

&gt; # Highest Bullish Sentiment of the Year

&gt; As we noted last week, this week's sentiment data is the first to encapsulate any reaction to last week's CPI number as well as the subsequent market rally. Although price action has been somewhat choppy and there have been plenty of other catalysts (FTX's collapse, more yield curve inversions, the missile strike in Poland) to balance out the inflation data and put investors back onto their heels, the latest AAII survey has shown a surge in bullish sentiment. The percentage of respondents reporting as optimistic jumped from 25.1% last week up to 33.5% this week. That is not only the largest one-week increase since the first week of June (when bulls rose by 12.2 percentage points) but is now the highest reading on bulls since the last week of 2021.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/111722-Sentiment-1.png))**

&gt; Bearish sentiment in turn dropped sharply falling to 40.2% for a decline of 6.8 percentage points. While an improvement, at the start of the month bearish sentiment had fallen by much more (both the last week of October and the first week of November saw double-digit week-over-week declines) and was at a much lower level of 32.9%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/111722-Sentiment-2.png))**

&gt; The bull-bear spread has narrowed but still remains negative for the 33rd week in a row. If the spread remains negative into next week, it will tie the record streak from 2020.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/111722-Sentiment-6.png))**

&gt; Neutral sentiment fell for a second week in a row with the total decline in that time eclipsing 10 percentage points. At 26.3%, it is down to the lowest level since the week of October 20th, implying that investors have become a bit more decisive in their respective market views.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/111722-Sentiment-4.png))**

&gt; The AAII survey's more bullish turn this week was also seen in other readings on sentiment like the Investors Intelligence survey and the NAAIM Exposure Index. As a result, our sentiment composite which aggregates the findings of the three surveys into a single sentiment reading is back up to its highest reading since mid-August. Although the reading remains negative, it is no longer at the extreme levels that were common earlier this year.

&gt; # Consumer Discretionary's Muddled Relative Strength

&gt; Ranging from today's retail sales report to homebuilder sentiment to the earnings of some of the largest retailers like Target (TGT) and Lowe's (LOW), the economic and earnings calendar this week has given Consumer Discretionary stocks plenty of news to digest. Outside of the spring to late summer, the sector has generally been on the decline relative to the S&amp;P 500 in 2022. Last week, that relative strength line bounced right as it reached the late May low. However, over the past few days, it has been resuming its move lower, meaning it is back to underperforming.

&gt; While on a sector level the relative strength line has been falling, drilling down to the industry group level, there has been more variation. For example, even with some positive responses to earnings from the likes of Home Depot (HD) or Lowe's (LOW), the retailing industry has seen a sharp grind lower in its relative strength line versus the S&amp;P 500. Similarly, autos have seen a turn lower although it has been underperforming the S&amp;P for a longer period of time since the early fall. Meanwhile, Consumer Durables and Appliances (which includes stocks like the homebuilders and home appliance makers) has been moving higher. That move has paled in comparison to the relative strength of Consumer Services stocks (restaurants, cruise lines, hotels and resorts), though, as that group's line has surged over the past couple of months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/111622-RSa.png))**

&gt; As mentioned above, retailers in the Consumer Discretionary sector have been underperforming the S&amp;P 500 lately but there is another group of retailers in which performance has been more solid. The Food &amp; Staples Retail industry is a component of the Consumer Staples sector, and its relative strength line has been trending higher since the spring lows. In fact, after the past week's move higher thanks in part to a strong response to Walmart (WMT) earnings, its relative strength line is approaching some of the highest levels of the past year, entirely recovering the massive drop from May in the wake of another, much more negatively received, WMT earnings report.

&gt; # How Bottoms Form. (It Might Surprise You.)

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 rallied again last week and was more than 10% off the October 12 closing lows, before selling off some yesterday. Nonetheless, the truth is the overall news really hasn’t really been that great, yet stocks have staged a strong rally over the past month. What gives?

&gt; Turns out, this is what tends to happen coming off major lows for stocks more often than not. Our friends at JPM Asset Management put together some of the best charts I’ve ever seen to describe this phenomenon. You can read the whole report from Michael Cembalest here.

&gt; They found that from the Eisenhower recession in 1957 to stagflation in the 1970s, to the early 1980s double dip recession, to the 1990 recession, stocks turned higher well before the other parts of the economy began to turn higher. As you can see below, stocks tended to bottom months (and sometimes years) before earnings, GDP, and payrolls officially turn higher.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/blog-chart-166-800x527.png))**

&gt; More recently we saw similar action during the Financial Crisis and then again during the worst of COVID. I’ll never forget how stocks soared in April, May, and June of 2020, yet we saw some of the very worst headlines in our country’s history. The truth is the stock market isn’t looking in the rear-view mirror, it is always looking forward and discounting what could be out there in the future.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/blog-chart-245-800x257.png))**

&gt; To keep things honest, this doesn’t have a perfect track record, as, after the dot-com burst, GDP and earnings both turned higher well before stocks officially bottomed.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/blog-chart-34.png))**

&gt; This in one of the more confusing concepts for many investors, but it is one that is so important to understand. Stocks will likely rise even as the news is bad, this is how it works. If you are waiting for things to officially improve, you likely will miss out on substantial gains along the way.

&gt; Burt White likes to say if you are playing a video game and you are going toward the monsters, you are going in the right direction. Investing is similar, as times will sometimes be extra scary, but this is part of the process. If you are scared or uncomfortable, that is all part of investing in a lot of ways and if you run the other way every time things get scary, you’ll likely never be able to meet your investment goals.

&gt; # Homebuilder Hopes Demolished

&gt; The national average on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage has come back below 7%, but it remains elevated versus recent history as housing data still can't catch a break. This morning, the NAHB released their latest reading on homebuilder sentiment and for the eleventh month in a row, the headline index fell month over month. As shown below, the current streak of nearly a year straight of declines is far and away a record, surpassing two eight-month long streaks leading up to the Financial Crisis.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/111622-NAHB-1a.png))**

&gt; This month, homebuilder sentiment dropped another 5 points down to 33. That is not the largest drop of the current streak of declines, with bigger drops of 8 points last month or 12 points in July, but it still ranks in the bottom 4% of all months on record. In other words, not only is homebuilder sentiment falling consistently, but it's falling fairly fast. The other components have also seen bottom decile declines with the only sub-index avoiding declines being in the West.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/111622-NAHB-2.png))**

&gt; After the November decline, the headline homebuilder sentiment reading sits 3 points above the spring 2020 low. Similarly, Present Sales and Traffic are down to the lowest level since April 2020 while Future Sales have actually surpassed those levels to now sit at the weakest reading in over a decade.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/111622-NAHB-1.png))**

&gt; Last month, we highlighted how the geographic breakdown of sentiment was showing homebuilders in the Northeast being much more optimistic than their counter parts in the rest of the country. In November, that region joined the rest of the pack with a massive 17 point decline. That ranks as the third largest monthly decline on record behind a 19 point drop in June 2010 and the 45 point decline at the onset of the pandemic in April 2020. While that has not been enough to result in a new low, similar to sentiment in the Midwest, sentiment in the South is down to the lowest level in a decade. The same could be said for the West although it rose marginally month over month.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/111622-NAHB-3.png))**

&gt; As for the reaction of homebuilder stocks, the iShares US Home Construction ETF (ITB) is trading 1.1% lower as of this writing. As shown below, after last week's equity market surge on CPI in which the group moved not only above its 50-DMA but also its 200-DMA, ITB has continued to hold above its moving averages for now. Without much follow through on the post-CPI surge, any move above last week's highs would be a welcome bullish sign, whereas the 200-DMA is looking to be the critical level of support for the time being.

170,DELL,My 1987 Crash Experience,"So a lot of people asked me to recount this, God knows why, but I'm happy to do it if I can get it done before the Astros game.

In 1987 I was at UT, having just finished my freshman year. I was interested in the markets, so I applied for an internship with Dean Witter.

They didn't take anyone who wasn't going into their junior year, but the broker who was looking (Ken) really dug my interview and recommended me to the manager for a second interview, because he wanted to go against the custom to get me.

That interview is a whole other story but when he asked ""why shouldn't I give you this position"", my answer was ""because if you do, one day I'll take your job"". He was aggressive, loved that, and let Ken hire me.

I went in after class three days a week and made cold calls and stuff. It wasn't selling, that wasn't legal because I had no license. I was gathering information and trying to get people to talk to Ken. 

I was good at it and into it. My parents bought me some ties and nice shirts and slacks and so forth, and I dug in hard. I was putting up big numbers.

Ken was a giant broker with his own little suite in the office on one end. Had his own reception area, conference room, and giant office. He was also as cool a 40 year old dude as my 18 year old ass had ever met. 

Anyway, one day I get out of class and head to the office as per usual.

I walk in and there are women running everywhere, literally like the building was on fire. I thought there was a plumbing leak, fire, or fight or something. Back then we didn't think about active shooters.

As I walk past the empty reception desk I see the first glass-walled office and this older dude, probably my current age (55) literally sitting at his desk crying like a fat kid who dropped his ice cream. I mean sobbing audibly through the window.

I turn right to head to Ken's office suite and I see the same. Guys screaming into their headsets (we had wires attached to our phones back then), some crying, and the assistants running around. 

I found out the pneumatic tubes we used to send orders (they were handwritten on tickets back then) were overloaded and broken. They were running orders to the cage for processing.

I get to Ken's office and walk in and he's on he phone and he literally waves his hand at me and screams ""GET THE FUCK OUT!!!!!""

I'm in complete shock.

I go to leave and his assistant runs past me back to his office and I keep going to the door.

She runs back and grabs me and says ""wait... he needs you to call all these people and tell them to relax and answer the phone because Ken's gonna call them soon.""

She hands me his ""B book"", which is the way he kept his clients. They were on paper with ticket copies behind each person's page. They were arranged usually by size of account and activity. He was calling the ""A book"" and I was letting the B people know he was going to get with them.

So the actual Dean Witter computer system got overwhelmed and pseudo-crashed.

When we were placing orders they were coming back all fucked up in batches. So 10 people would sell IBM, and the trades were so fast and furious and everyone was selling that you couldn't match a sale to a ticket.

At the end of the day the floor sent us massive notices that said shit like ""your branch sold 10,000 shares of IBM at $100 (no idea if that was the price - just an example), 8,000 at $90, 15,000 at 87 5/8 (that's the way the prices used to be, in 1/8s), and 23,000 at 84."" 

We all met in the conference room (I was there to find Ken's client pages when he asked for them) and literally, I shit you not, argued over who would get what price for which client.

The manager would say ""we've got 27,000 shares of Dell at 4 and 5/8 gone, 18,000 at 3 7/8, and 50 thousand at 2 7/8. Make your pitch.""

Ken would say ""I need 10,000 of those at 4 5/8. My guy has 2.4 million with us, he's been my client for 5 years, and he fucking deserves it.""

Then other guys would ask for shares and the manager would ask who they were for and why they should get them.

We were there all night. These guys cussed each other, cussed the manager, threw shit, stormed out and came back... it was a fucking war.

Basically the bigtime brokers got the best prices, and they gave their best prices to their best customers.

The thing is, that practice is illegal. It's called allocating trades. It what made Hillary Clinton a PILE of money in futures. She always got the lowest buy price and the highest sale. Not in that crash, way later. Long story but check it out.

Anyway, that was all kinds of fuckery. Guys quit over it. If the manager didn't like you, your customers got raped.

So we were there fighting for pricing til like 9 or 10, and calling clients to deliver the bad news until almost 1 a.m.

So that sucked, but the weirdest was yet to come.

Ken asked me to skip class the next day to help him call everyone he couldn't get ahold of, help the assistant field incoming calls, and work the paperwork for his books. I did it. Screw it. This was gonna be my career.
 
I get there at like 7:30 and there are two effing armed guards at the double doors, which were closed and locked. 

I ask if we're closed (I just assumed the whole firm had gone under  -  I was still in a half daze), and got ready to leave. Security guy asks my name. I say ""Bob Wheeler. I work for Ken.""

Dude knocks on the door and says ""Bob Wheeler. Kid who works for Ken.""

The door opens and another armed guy lets me in. He takes my backpack and empties it on the reception desk. Says ""okay, take your stuff.""

I get back to Ken's suite and find out from his assistant that we're all getting free breakfast. It was massive and badass. Like everything you could ever want. Bacon, eggs, biscuits, juices, fruits. I mean a major spread. 

So I ask her if it was bonus for some kind of great job and she shocks me to death.

She says ""no, and we're getting lunch too. We're locked in. We aren't leaving til the market closes and no clients are allowed in. There've been several death threats to basically everyone. When you leave you'll have an armed guard.""

I about shit my pants. It wasn't the same for a LONG TIME. The guys didn't go out for drinks together anymore, people didn't walk into each other's offices, nothing. For six weeks it was like working in a fucking cemetery.

To Ken's credit he had people buying with both hands and I'm sure everyone who listened ended up rich, but it was a goddamned bloodbath and lots of brokers never recovered.

So that's the story. When the market goes down 5% I'm not fazed.",4594,768,1666223346.0,2022-10-19T23:49:06+00:00,t3_y8ia9y,wallstreetbets
17,DELL,Intel Plans to Cut Thousands of Jobs in Face of PC Slowdown,"Intel Corp. is planning a major reduction in headcount, likely numbering in the thousands, to cut costs and cope with a sputtering personal-computer market, according to people with knowledge of the situation. 

The layoffs will be announced as early as this month, with the company planning to make the move around the same time as its third-quarter earnings report on Oct. 27, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the deliberations are private. The chipmaker had 113,700 employees as of July.

Some divisions, including Intel’s sales and marketing group, could see cuts affecting about 20% of staff, according to the people familiar with the situation.

Intel is facing a steep decline in demand for PC processors, its main business, and has struggled to win back market share lost to rivals like Advanced Micro Devices Inc. In July, the company warned that 2022 sales would be about $11 billion lower than it previously expected. Analysts are predicting a third-quarter revenue drop of nearly 20%. And Intel’s once-enviable margins have shriveled: They’re about 15 percentage points narrower than historical numbers of around 60%. 

During its second-quarter earnings call, Intel acknowledged that it could make changes in its business to improve profits. “We are also lowering core expenses in calendar year 2022 and will look to take additional actions in the second half of the year,” Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger said at the time. 

Intel, based in Santa Clara, California, declined to comment on the layoffs.

Intel’s last big wave of layoffs occurred in 2016, when it trimmed about 12,000 jobs, or 11% of its total. The company has made smaller cuts since then and shuttered several divisions, including its cellular modem and drone units. Like many companies in the technology industry, Intel also froze hiring earlier this year, when market conditions soured and fears of a recession grew.

Gelsinger took the helm at Intel last year and has been working to restore the company’s reputation as a Silicon Valley legend. But even before the PC slump, it was an uphill fight. Intel lost its long-held technological edge, and its own executives acknowledge that the company’s culture of innovation withered in recent years.

Now a broader slump is adding to those challenges. Intel’s PC, data center and artificial intelligence groups are contending with a tech spending slowdown, weighing on revenue and profit.

PC sales tumbled 15% in the third quarter from a year earlier, according to IDC. HP Inc., Dell Technologies Inc, and Lenovo Group Ltd., which use Intel’s processors in their laptops and desktop PCs, all suffered steep declines.

It’s a particularly awkward moment for Intel to be making cutbacks. The company lobbied heavily for a $52 billion chip-stimulus bill this year, vowing to expand its manufacturing in the US. Gelsinger is planning a building boom that includes bringing the world’s biggest chipmaking hub to Ohio. 

At the same time, the company is under intense pressure from investors to shore up its profits. The company’s shares have fallen more than 50% in 2022, with a 20% plunge occurring in the last month alone.

US tensions with China also have clouded the chip industry’s future. The Biden administration announced new export curbs on Friday, restricting what US technologies companies can sell to the Asian nation.

David Zinsner, Intel’s chief financial officer, said after the company’s latest quarterly report that “there are large opportunities for Intel to improve and deliver maximum output per dollar.” The chipmaker expected to see restructuring charges in the third quarter, he said, signaling that cuts were looming.

Some chipmakers, including Nvidia Corp. and Micron Technology Inc., have said they’re steering clear of layoffs for now. But other tech companies, such as Oracle Corp. and Arm Ltd., have already been cutting jobs.

18,DELL,Biden to hit China with broader curbs on U.S. chip and tool exports,"The Biden administration plans next month to broaden curbs on U.S shipments to China of semiconductors used for artificial intelligence and chipmaking tools, several people familiar with the matter said. The Commerce Department intends to publish new regulations based on restrictions communicated in letters earlier this year to three U.S. companies — KLA, Lam Research and Applied Materials, the people said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. The plan for new rules has not been previously reported. The letters, which the companies publicly acknowledged, forbade them from exporting chipmaking equipment to Chinese factories that produce advanced semiconductors with sub-14 nanometer processes unless the sellers obtain Commerce Department licenses. The rules would also codify restrictions in Commerce Department letters sent to Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices last month instructing them to halt shipments of several artificial intelligence computing chips to China unless they obtain licenses.

So-called “is informed” letters allow the Commerce Department to bypass lengthy rule-writing processes to put controls in place quickly, but the letters only apply to the companies that receive them. Turning the letters into rules would broaden their reach and could subject other U.S. companies producing similar technology to the restrictions. The regulations could potentially apply to companies trying to challenge Nvidia and AMD’s dominance in artificial intelligence chips. Intel and startups like Cerebras Systems are targeting the same advanced computing markets. Intel said it is closely monitoring the situation, while Cerebras declined to comment.

One source said the rules could also impose license requirements on shipments to China of products that contain the targeted chips. Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Super Micro Computer make data center servers that contain Nvidia’s A100 chip. Dell and HPE said they were monitoring the situation, while Super Micro Computer did not respond to a request for comment.

19,DELL,Pure Storage Shares Rally As Earnings Top Estimates,"[https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/pure-storage-stock-earnings-51661981062?siteid=nf-rss](https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/pure-storage-stock-earnings-51661981062?siteid=nf-rss)

[Pure Storage](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/PSTG?mod=MW_story_quote) shares are trading higher after the storage company posted better results than expected in a quarter that challenged some other companies serving the enterprise market.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and [Cisco Systems](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/CSCO?mod=MW_story_quote) (CSCO) turned in solid recent results, but the numbers were softer from Dell Technologies (DELL), [HP Inc](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/HPQ?mod=MW_story_quote). (HPQ), and others. Earlier Wednesday, the disk-drive maker [Seagate](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/STX?mod=MW_story_quote) (STX) [reduced its full year guidance](https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/seagate-cuts-first-quarter-revenue-outlook-51661950149), citing softening demand from some data-center and cloud customers.

Yet Pure sailed through, showing little damage from big-picture issues.

For its fiscal second quarter, ended Aug. 7, Pure reported revenue of $646.8 million, up 30% from a year earlier, and ahead of [management’s forecast of $635 million](https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/pure-storage-stock-price-earnings-51654121635). On an adjusted basis, the company earned 32 cents a share, a dime ahead of Wall Street expectations. Under generally accepted accounting principles, the company earned 4 cents a share, up from a loss of 16 cents in the year-earlier quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin in the quarter was 16.4%, well above the company’s target of 11.8%.

Pure reported annual recurring revenue of $953.3 million, up 31%, with remaining performance obligations of $1.5 billion, up 25% from a year ago. The company bought back $61 million of stock in the quarter, ending the period with $1.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.

Pure is projecting fiscal third-quarter revenue of $670 million, above the Street consensus forecast of $651 million, with a non-GAAP operating margin of 12.7%. For the January 2023 fiscal year, the company now sees revenue of $2.75 billion, up from a previous forecast of $2.66 billion. Pure now projects full year non-GAAP operating margin of 14%, up from a previous forecast of 12%.

CEO Charlie Giancarlo said in an interview with *Barron’s* that Pure had “an excellent quarter,” pointing to 31% growth in annual revenue for Pure’s subscription business. “We had strong operating margins, good cash flow, and good net new logo growth,” he said, referring to companies signing on as customers.

Giancarlo said Pure continues to see strong growth from cloud customers. He said that while the company is seeing the sales cycle slow a little at some customers, “the market has stayed reasonably strong” overall. He said he expects that Pure can continue to grow faster than the rest of the market whether or not there is a recession.

Asked about the higher-than-expected operating margin in the quarter, Giancarlo said that expenses were a little lower than anticipated due to slower than expected hiring in the period",15,2,1661982283.0,2022-08-31T21:44:43+00:00,t3_x2plkj,stocks

# [Dow futures slide more than 200 points, building on last week’s sharp sell-off](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/28/stock-market-news-futures-open-to-close-live-updates.html)
*****
&gt; Stock futures fell Monday as worries over rising rates and tighter monetary policy added fuel to a rout that began in the previous session.
*****
&gt; Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 264 points, or about 0.8%. Those for the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 dropped 1% and 1.2%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Wall Street was suffered a sharp sell-off on Friday, when Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s short and blunt remarks in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, appeared to extinguish hopes of the central bank changing its aggressive course of rate hikes in the months ahead.
*****
&gt; The Dow fell 1,008 points, or just over 3%, for its worst day since May. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite fell 3.4% and 3.9%, respectively, for their worst days since June. The drop erased the August gains for all three averages.
*****
&gt; “Investors again cut back on their recent Risk-On positioning, supporting our view that it is way too soon to call their recent risk appetite a more permanent stance, and now one more likely to have cost them badly,” Rick Bensignor of Bensignor Investment Strategies said in a note to clients.
*****
&gt; Meanwhile in Europe over the weekend, European Central Bank board member Isabel Schnabel warned that central banks must continue to fight inflation — even if it tips economies into recession.
*****
&gt; The coming week brings more Fed speeches, including Vice Chair Lael Brainard on Tuesday, before August’s nonfarm payrolls report on Friday.

#[Stock futures slip ahead of Fed Chair Powell’s speech in Jackson Hole](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/25/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures were lower on Friday, dimming hopes that the S&amp;P 500 could grind out another positive week.
*****
&gt; Stock futures dipped Friday as investors awaited Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s speech in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 87 points, or 0.3%. S&amp;P 500 futures traded 0.4% lower, and Nasdaq 100 futures slipped by 0.6%.
*****
&gt; The moves followed an up day for the major averages in which the Dow jumped about 300 points, and the S&amp;P 500 gained 1.4%. The Nasdaq Composite was the outperformer, advancing 1.7% as a pullback in yields helped tech shares.
*****
&gt; “Overall, it remains a really attractive moment to invest in equities. Underlying company performance is strong for the highest quality companies, and multiples are down because of macro fears. That’s the setup every long-term investor looks for,” Robert Cantwell, a portfolio manager at Upholdings, told CNBC.
*****
&gt; Nevertheless, all the major averages are on pace for their second straight down week. The Dow is on track for a 1.2% decline. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are heading to slightly smaller declines of 0.7% and 0.5%, respectively.
*****
&gt; All eyes are on Powell’s widely anticipated 10 a.m. ET speech at the central bank’s annual symposium in Wyoming.
*****
&gt; Investors are hoping for new guidance about how the Fed will act this autumn, but expectations are lower, with many expecting Powell to reiterate the Fed’s promise to slow inflation by raising interest rates. Opinion’s divided on whether the Fed will bump rates by half a percentage point or three quarters of a point at its next policy meeting in September.
*****
&gt; The personal consumption expenditures, one of the Fed’s favorite inflation measures, will also be watched ahead of Powell’s speech Friday morning.
*****
&gt; “We’re likely to see a relief tomorrow unless we get a big shock from what Powell says,” Gabriela Santos, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, told CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.” “One thing I would keep an eye out on if we look to next week and into the fall… implied bond volatility is still very, very high for where it normally is in late August, suggesting that actually we’re likely to continue seeing a lot of action in the yield curve, which could affect stock markets in the fall.”

#[Stock futures slip ahead of Fed Chair Powell’s speech in Jackson Hole](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/25/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures were lower on Friday, dimming hopes that the S&amp;P 500 could grind out another positive week.
*****
&gt; Stock futures dipped Friday as investors awaited Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s speech in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 87 points, or 0.3%. S&amp;P 500 futures traded 0.4% lower, and Nasdaq 100 futures slipped by 0.6%.
*****
&gt; The moves followed an up day for the major averages in which the Dow jumped about 300 points, and the S&amp;P 500 gained 1.4%. The Nasdaq Composite was the outperformer, advancing 1.7% as a pullback in yields helped tech shares.
*****
&gt; “Overall, it remains a really attractive moment to invest in equities. Underlying company performance is strong for the highest quality companies, and multiples are down because of macro fears. That’s the setup every long-term investor looks for,” Robert Cantwell, a portfolio manager at Upholdings, told CNBC.
*****
&gt; Nevertheless, all the major averages are on pace for their second straight down week. The Dow is on track for a 1.2% decline. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are heading to slightly smaller declines of 0.7% and 0.5%, respectively.
*****
&gt; All eyes are on Powell’s widely anticipated 10 a.m. ET speech at the central bank’s annual symposium in Wyoming.
*****
&gt; Investors are hoping for new guidance about how the Fed will act this autumn, but expectations are lower, with many expecting Powell to reiterate the Fed’s promise to slow inflation by raising interest rates. Opinion’s divided on whether the Fed will bump rates by half a percentage point or three quarters of a point at its next policy meeting in September.
*****
&gt; The personal consumption expenditures, one of the Fed’s favorite inflation measures, will also be watched ahead of Powell’s speech Friday morning.
*****
&gt; “We’re likely to see a relief tomorrow unless we get a big shock from what Powell says,” Gabriela Santos, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, told CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.” “One thing I would keep an eye out on if we look to next week and into the fall… implied bond volatility is still very, very high for where it normally is in late August, suggesting that actually we’re likely to continue seeing a lot of action in the yield curve, which could affect stock markets in the fall.”

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures were higher Thursday morning after all three major averages ended higher during the daily trading session.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures gained 118 points, or 0.4%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.5% and 0.6%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Snowflake jumped 17% after posting a beat on revenue. Shares of Nvidia slid 4% on the heels of a quarterly report that missed Wall Street’s expectations. Salesforce fell more than 6% after the company provided a disappointing forecast for fiscal 2023.
*****
&gt; The Dow on Wednesday rose slightly along with the S&amp;P 500. For both averages, the gains snapped three-day long losing streaks. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite also ticked up 0.41%.
*****
&gt; The market action took place as investors await the start of the Jackson Hole economic symposium, which begins Thursday with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell scheduled to speak the following morning. Traders will be listening for more information about how the central bank will combat high inflation and if policymakers may cut rates when the current hiking cycle is over.
*****
&gt; “It’s steady as it goes, it’s way too early for the Fed to consider a pivot,” said Jim Bianco, president of Bianco Research, on CNBC’s “Fast Money.”
*****
&gt; Investors are also waiting for key economic reports scheduled to come out later in the week, including jobless claims Thursday and the personal consumption expenditures Friday. The PCE report is one of the Fed’s favorite inflation measures, and it could influence its actions going forward.
*****
&gt; Peloton reports quarterly earnings Thursday before the bell, along with Gap, Dollar Tree and Dollar General. Ulta Beauty, Workday and Affirm Holdings will release their own results after markets close Thursday.

173,DELL,HPQ? More like BBQ,"HPQ more like BBQ

 

Disclaimer, if you’re a hedgefund employee promptly go to the next post thx. This also isn’t financial advice so idk why you’d be here anyway.

TLDR @ bottom

Now that the rats are gone let me dive into this company.

Fundamentals: Hewlett Packard aka HPQ = a global provider of personal computing and devices to businesses small and large – you might use HP at work! (scrub)

Personal Systems is 68% of their revenue, and printing 32%

HP is a IT company – focused on pc’s and printers. It makes hardware, supplies, media, software, scanning devices, large printers. It’s competitors are Lenovo, Dell, Acer, ASUSTeK, Apple, Toshiba, Samsung…From a long point of view, I’m bullish. In the short term, I’m not hence my option.

HPQ recently acquired Plantronics (POLY) for 3.3billy inclusive of all debt as well. This is a company with debt, that acquired another company with more debt. It’s got debt now. It’s move in purchasing POLY signified a shift into becoming a 1 stop shop for all things PC related for businesses. Get your PC’s, printers, headsets, phones, the whole 9 – at HPQ. This is a good move for it in a general sense but it will take time to grow and come clean on it’s investment. When you tie in POLY, it’s debt, and the timeline for growth over the next year or so – the company is going to be faced with some big challenges.

The first and most obvious to me is the political / economic issues that will cause HPQ to contract temporarily.

China is still doing lockdowns. They don’t mess with free will. 1 case? Whole place is locked down.

If they continue this kind of trajectory, or if it gets even slightly worse, factories where HPQ conducts business will be stifled. Further, political tensions between US and China are rising, the war in Ukraine is still going on. 70% of the neon gas which is used for semiconductors is based out of Ukraine. 70% of the semi conductors are from TW and KR. With the ongoing political environment, it’s likely that these shipments will be delayed, or HPQ will mass order items to stock their inventory. Add in a new purchase of a new company, and new components and new logistics – it will make this harder

Simultaneously, we’re going into a recession or are already in one depending on what definition you use.

Demand for PCs spiked during the height of the pandemic, but recently consumers have pulled back on this. The demand for PCs and components is naturally cyclical. So everyone who just bought all this stuff in the pandemic while they had money, probably won’t be looking for any new gear over the next year or two.

Further, lending rates are getting higher, meaning the amount of research and development that HPQ can do will become more expensive. At the same time, they are already in the hole. Their debt is double their liquid cash. They aren’t paying their debt down whatsoever. If they take out more, at a more expensive price, it will even lower their fundamentals. Further, small businesses themselves will be dealing with higher rates when borrowing, meaning with everything getting more expensive, they’ll likely just stick with what they have until things become less expensive.

What about it’s institutional investors? Buffet’s BRK is holding the most shares of any institution at the moment and he’s one of the savviest investors of all time.

The institutional investors are a double edged blade. Them holding 85% of shares are simply because they have good dividends and a good PE. However, if one investor starts to pull out, it could signify a large dip

 



 

 

I’m predicting that due to logistical issues, their debt, the low ROE, the acquisition of POLY and incoming recession and lower consumer eagerness to buy, some of these holders will sell their shares to focus on other companies in competition with HPQ. Right now the institutional ownership is higher than almost any other company in the computer processing hardware industry.

Let me go into some more detail here with my logictistic approach.

HP sucks – if you’re a 90s kid or around that time. You remember these gents – you never bought HP over Dell. HPQ has bs design, and it’s just ugly. They’re honestly just trash. Also, they claim the volatility is low – it’s only sitting at 44%...have you seen the tech bizness? It’s dog eat dog. These guys could get replaced by an American company in a heart beat.

Look at this flawless channel and chart analysis:



 

As you can see – my blue line is a straight shot at the ~$20 mark. As you can also see – these is where HPQ has been trending since 2018 – it wasn’t until the stimulus and that massive quarter they had of selling a shit ton of products that they mooned up there, then they dipped again, and then buffet bought so it stayed where it’s at.

This stock is gonna dip, just like the rest of the market, and it’s set to dip at a good amount if even just a few institutional investors get it through their thick skulls that HPQ is a dying company. It’s in debt, it has more debt than leverage. It’s sitting on inventory, it’s not going to see an increase in value until another year or two. This company has a lot of growth to focus on in an environment where growth is expensive. Investors will see that their ROE is garbage and allocate their resources in other places.

As always, this is not financial advice. 

TLDR: HPQ going down down, buy puts. Also idk how to format so sorry you can’t see the analysis

# [Stock futures flat following the S&amp;P 500′s third straight losing day](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/23/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures were little changed Wednesday as investors await more guidance from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on the central bank’s tightening path.
*****
&gt; Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 were all roughly flat.
*****
&gt; Both the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 declined for a third straight session Tuesday amid relatively thin trading volumes. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite finished Tuesday little changed. The S&amp;P 500 is about flat on the month after rallying more than 9% in July.
*****
&gt; The three-day Jackson Hole economic symposium starts Thursday with Powell slated to speak Friday morning. Fed watchers expect him to reinforce the central bank’s goal of squashing inflation and keeping expectations about future prices gains in check.
*****
&gt; “Financial markets will remain in choppy waters until Fed Chair Powell’s Jackson Hole speech on Friday,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. “He may struggle to convince markets that he is comfortable with tightening policy and triggering a recession. The economy is clearly slowing but it is still too early for the Fed to signal that they will be less aggressive with tightening policy.”
*****
&gt; Investors will also monitor incoming data to gauge the health of the economy. Durable goods and pending home sales are on deck for Wednesday.

&gt; Stock futures inched higher Tuesday as the market tried to recover from its worst day since June.

*****
&gt; The Dow dropped more than 600 points Monday, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite fell more than 2% each. Those were the biggest one-day drops for the Dow and S&amp;P 500 since June 16. The Nasdaq suffered its worst session since June 28.
*****
&gt; Monday’s sell-off was broad-based, with all 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors closing lower, led by declines in information technology and consumer discretionary stocks. A slide in tech stocks weighed down the tech-heavy Nasdaq.
*****
&gt; “The global growth story is in shambles right now,” said Ed Moya, a senior market analyst at Oanda. “That’s what’s really kind of weighing on risk appetite right now because you can’t have the U.S. continue to be attractive while the rest of the world is crumbling.”
*****
&gt; This sentiment will continue to put pressure on big tech and consumer discretionary stocks, he said. Moya, echoing other investors, expects another round of hawkish pushback from Fed chair Jerome Powell when he speaks Friday at the central bank’s annual Jackson Hole economic symposium.
*****
&gt; Earnings season continues Tuesday with results from Macy’s, Nordstrom and Dick’s Sporting Goods. July new home sales will also be reported, along with August manufacturing PMI and the August Richmond Fed survey.

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures fell Monday following a halt in the summer rally last week, as fears of aggressive interest rate hikes returned to Wall Street.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell 321 points, or by 0.95%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures dropped 1.22% and 1.57%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Those moves come as European markets experienced steep declines, driven in part by worries of rising inflation and higher interest rates around the world.
*****
&gt; On Friday, the S&amp;P 500 closed down 1.29%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 292 points, or 0.86%, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.01%. The major averages also posted weekly losses.
*****
&gt; Investors are anticipating what could be a volatile week of trading ahead of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s latest comments on inflation at the central bank’s annual Jackson Hole economic symposium.
*****
&gt; “Fed Chair Powell is likely to sound meaningfully more hawkish during his Jackson Hole speech on Friday morning at 10am ET than he did at his July 27th press conference, when he said the fed funds rate is already back to neutral,” according to a Monday report from Wolfe Research’s Chris Senyek.
*****
&gt; On the earnings front, traders are expecting Palo Alto Networks and Zoom Video to report results Monday after the bell.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 22nd, 2022.

# **Stocks fall Friday to notch weekly loss, S&amp;P 500 snaps 4-week-long rally - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/18/stock-market-news-live-updates-futures-open-to-close.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks tumbled on Friday as Wall Street’s summer rally faltered and rate hike fears resurfaced, leading the major averages to end the week on a sour note.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 slid 1.29% to close at 4,228.48, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 292.30 points, or 0.86%, to 33,706.74. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.01% to settle at 12,705.22.
*****
&gt; For the week, the S&amp;P edged 1.21% lower, while the Dow slipped 0.16%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq closed out the week down 2.62%.
*****
&gt; Friday’s halt in Wall Street’s summer rally came as minutes from the Federal Reserve’s July meeting and comments from St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard indicated that the central bank would likely continue hiking rates in the near term, putting a damper on investors’ hopes of a slowdown.
*****
&gt; Despite the week’s moves, many investors and traders are holding out hope for a bounce back.
*****
&gt; “I wouldn’t expect a complete reversal going back to the June lows or something like that, however, the choppiness we’re seeing today and this week does reflect a lot of the bear case that’s out there,” said FBB Capital Partners’ Mike Bailey. “I think seeing the market trade sideways or seeing a bit of a pause in that rally definitely makes sense based on some of the facts that we’re seeing out there.”
*****
&gt; Meanwhile, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond shares cratered more than 40% after Ryan Cohen dumped his entire stake in the retailer. The move seemed to dampen sentiment among meme stock traders who have bet big on the company in recent months.
*****
&gt; In other news, about a $2 trillion notional value worth of options contracts expired on Friday. Options expirations can add volatility to markets as some holders may be forced to move into their positions.

&gt; # September Almanac: Only 4 NASDAQ Wins in Last 12 Midterm Septembers

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/ae0526fdc81e4647a92654fd01bafc40/ea931548fa046435-aa/s500x750/edd7a611bfd1e3a45544584d8d198310a4e18b80.jpg))**

&gt; Since 1950, September is the worst performing month of the year for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971), Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 (since 1979). September was creamed four years straight from 1999-2002 after four solid years from 1995-1998 during the dot.com bubble madness. Although September’s overall rank improves modestly in midterm years going back to 1950, average losses widen for DJIA (–0.8%), NASDAQ (–0.8%), Russell 1000 (–1.0%) and Russell 2000 (–0.8%). S&amp;P 500’s average September loss improves slightly from –0.5% to –0.4% in midterm years. Although September 2002 does influence the average declines, the fact remains DJIA has declined in 11 of the last 18 midterm-year Septembers.

&gt; # Total Return vs Price Change Spreads

&gt; As we mentioned in today's Chart of the Day, there can be a wide spread between total returns and price change based on dividend yield. Although it doesn't always make financial sense for a company to pay dividends, they can certainly magnify returns all else equal. Click here to start a two-week trial to Bespoke Premium and receive our paid content in real-time.

&gt; The table below outlines twenty S&amp;P 500 stocks that have seen a high percentage of their returns over the last twenty years come from dividends. The average stock on this list has seen over 80% of their gains over the last two decades come from dividends alone. Although the average stock on this list has only seen a price gain of 61.1% since August of 2002, their average total return when factoring in dividends re-invested has been 278%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/Spread-Table-081822.png))**

&gt; To show you what we mean, below is a chart of price change versus total return over the last 20 years for Altria Group (MO). As you can see, the dividend in this case turns a below average stock into an outperformer.

&gt; # Bulls Set a New High

&gt; Bullish sentiment continued its recent run of increases according to the weekly AAII individual investor sentiment survey. Hitting 33.3% this week, bulls are at the highest level since the last week of 2021. That 2022 is nearly 2/3 complete and we still haven't seen a bullish reading over 33.3% tells you how negative investors have been this year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081822-AAII-1.png))**

&gt; Bears also ticked up this week reaching 37.2% versus 36.7% last week. While bearish sentiment has only been below 40% for three weeks in a row, that is the longest stretch of sub-40% readings since the start of the year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081822-AAII-2.png))**

&gt; With more bears than bulls once again this week, the bull-bear spread has now been negative for 20 straight weeks.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081822-AAII-5.png))**

&gt; With both bulls and bears higher, neutral sentiment was the only reading to fall this week. Neutral sentiment dropped 1.7 percentage points from 31.2% down to 29.5%. That was only the lowest reading in four weeks as neutral sentiment sits the closest to its historical average of 31.4%.

&gt; # 10-Day A/D Line Overbought for 15 Days

&gt; In an earlier tweet, we pointed out the elevated readings across 10-day advance decline lines in our Sector Snapshot. Not only is the 10-Day A/D line for the S&amp;P 500 approaching one-year highs (as of yesterday's close), but it has been ""overbought"" for the last 15 trading days.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081722-10-day.png))**

&gt; Going back to the start of our data in 1990, there have only been eight other times in which the S&amp;P 500's 10-day A/D line has been overbought for 15 days in a row or more. The last time such a steak was observed was at the start of 2019 which ended at 22 days. That tied for the March 2016 streak for the longest on record back to 1990. We would also note that other than one streak in the first couple of months of 1991, nearly all of these long streaks with an overbought 10-day A/D line occurred since 2010. In other words, consistently impressive breadth by this measure has largely been a recent phenomenon.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081722-Streak1.png))**

&gt; This is not the only impressive breadth signal we have covered of late. For example, in yesterday's Chart of the Day we highlighted that more than 90% of S&amp;P 500 stocks were above their 50-DMAs. Prior times when we've seen that reading spike above 90% have been followed by strong returns in the months and year ahead. Looking at the past times in which the 10-day advance decline line has been overbought for 15 days in a row, forward performance of the S&amp;P 500 has not been considerably stronger than the norm. From that 15th day, the S&amp;P has risen half the time one week out. One and three month returns are more consistently positive but weaker than the norm on a median basis. In the year after the long overbought A/D streaks listed below, though, the S&amp;P was higher 7 of 8 times for an average gain of 11.1%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081722-Table.png))**

&gt; Below is a chart of the S&amp;P 500 since its 2009 Financial Crisis low. As shown, most of these overbought A/D line streaks have occurred as the index was recovering from some sort of sell off. Only one of them (in early 2018) came about at the time of a notable peak in the index.

&gt; # Moving Averages Putting Up a Fight

&gt; Just as the S&amp;P 500 ran into some resistance yesterday at its 200-day moving average (DMA), we've seen the same pattern play out in a number of commodities. Two of the more high-profile ones have been copper and crude oil.

&gt; Copper fell out of bed in the late spring and early summer, losing a third of its value. Along with the equity market, copper has seen a late-summer rally, but things came to a screeching halt right at the 50-DMA last Thursday. Copper has been down on two of the last three trading days and hasn't been able to trade back above that elusive 50-DMA since.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081722-Copper.png))**

&gt; Crude oil has been just as weak as copper lately, trading in a well-defined downtrend and breaking below its 200-DMA in early August. There was a little bit of a bounce last week, but resistance came into play at the 200-DMA, and after making another lower high, it has since made another lower low.

&gt; When stock, commodity, bond, or any other asset class is in a well-defined downtrend, the first thing they have to do to break out of their funks is clear resistance at key moving averages like the 50 and/or 200-DMA. In the case of copper and crude, they have both recently come up short. The S&amp;P 500, again, is facing some resistance at its 200-DMA, but at least it has managed to clear its 50-DMA which it did in the second half of July.

&gt; # Summer Rally Top: Almanac Aggregate Cycle

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/7e8069b2c2bd4e8de914d770f3d6de87/4c5d67735406068a-67/s500x750/5166d3e30c8566f6c5b3725cdf1409b76e765d5a.jpg))**

&gt; Bear market rally or new bull, the 2022 summer rally looks like its run it’s course. With the summer rally pushing DJIA up 13.5% from the June low with S&amp;P up 17.2% and NASDAQ up 23.3% here’s what we are looking at.

&gt; This impressive comeback rally pushed through technical resistance at the June highs. But our indicators and cycles analysis suggest another leg down that culminates in a lower low or retest of the lows at some point in the weak seasonal period August-October ahead of the midterm election.

&gt; Last week’s inflation numbers were certainly encouraging. But we would like to see further confirmation before moving into the bullish camp. We are bullish for Q4 and 2023 but remain vigilant about the potential for another leg down that either tests the June lows or makes a new low.

&gt; In preparation for the 2023 Stock Trader’s Almanac, we developed this brand-new Stock Trader’s Almanac Aggregate Cycle index (STAAC). STA Aggregate Cycle is a combination of the 1-Year Seasonal Pattern for All Years, the 4-Year Presidential Election Cycle and the Decennial Cycle. In the chart here STAAC is all years, midterm years and second years of decades post-WWII from 1946-2021.

&gt; # Housing Descending

&gt; Updates on Building Permits and Housing Starts were mixed relative to expectations for July. While Building Permits exceeded forecasts by 34K, Housing Starts missed forecasts by 81K falling to the lowest annualized rate (1.446 million) since February 2021. Housing represents a large share of the US economy on both a direct and indirect basis, so its health says about the state of the overall economy, Below we have updated our chart of Housing Starts on an average 12-month basis overlaid on top of recessions. Every recession since the late 1960s has been preceded by a rollover in the average rate of Housing Starts, and usually, the rollover starts well in advance of the recession.

&gt; For the current period, Housing Starts remain right near their highest levels of the cycle, but if you look real closely, you can see that the level peaked three months ago. Looking out over history, there are plenty of other periods where Starts declined for a few months but didn't roll over. In other words, based on what we've seen so far, Housing Starts have yet to show signals of an imminent recession. Based on this month's reading and the readings from a year ago, barring a major rebound, the 12-month average is likely to keep declining in the months ahead. Another factor to keep in mind about the historical relationship between Housing Starts and recessions is that in most cases, the recession didn't usually begin until months after the peak of Housing Starts.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081622-Housing-Starts-12-M.png))**

&gt; Taking a closer look at recent trends, the chart below shows the 12-month average of Building Permits and Housing Starts since the start of 2010. It's easier here to see the decline in Starts over the last few months. Building Permits, meanwhile, have continued to trend higher.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081622-Starts-and-Permits.png))**

&gt; On a single-family basis, though, both Building Permits and Housing Starts have shown signs of rolling over. Single-family Housing Starts have been moving sideways for over a year now and have just recently seen an acceleration in the rate of decline while Building Permits have been trending lower for a full year now.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081622-Starts-and-Permits-Single.png))**

&gt; Finally, the chart below compares the performance of Housing Starts over time to the performance of homebuilder stocks using the iShares US Home Construction ETF (ITB) as a proxy. While the two have tended to track each other over time, over the last couple of months, ITB has rallied while Housing Starts have been dropping. Either the market knows something about future developments in the residential housing market or investors have gotten a little offside in their positioning.

43,DELL,Bullish SPY play to the upside that will cost you very little.,"Fed minutes were good, right?  We're seeing a nice relief rally and it could have some legs. Come Tuesday if the economic data we get is either neutral or positive we could start to see some short covering.  Last week we had companies like Macy's, Ulta, Dell and Costco all do well on Friday.  When Victoria's Secret, HP and Salesforce report... as long as they don't shit the bed I see no reason why the rally won't continue into Wednesday.  The part we need to watch is the middle to the end of next week (wed-fri) where we may start to see some choppiness and yet another reversal depending on what comes out for the economic data (especially non-farm payrolls next Friday).

But for right now, does anybody remember how a few weeks ago when we (collectively) couldn't imagine breaking 410 from 460?  Well, here we are. I was kicking myself for not buying a few random OTM contracts ""just in case"".   Now?  We're !EXCITED! about going the other direction and the possibility of consolidating above 415.  Now, put contracts are CRAZY expensive.  People have caught on.  I for one made a killing while the market was crashing but you either need to get creative or plan on playing the reversal if you want to keep making money.  I plan on doing the latter.

Let's look at the June 22nd expiration for our initial analysis. Let's look at the SPY 6/22 430 call and the SPY 6/22 400 put.  Both are both 30 points away from the current stock price and there is a drastic difference between the two contracts.

A 430 call is currently priced at: 3.680.  353 in OI and 20.78% IV with a delta of 0.283.

A 400 put is currently priced at: 5.200.  168 in OI and 25.26% IV with a delta of -0.2817.

Now, maybe some wrinkle brains can explain to me why there is less OI yet the IV is higher on the 400p contract... but overall, based on the fact that the 400p is about 50% more expensive (which is the same with other similar contracts similarly spaced out) we can confidently say people are betting on the market going down.  This isn't something I just cooked up on my own either.  I've been hearing people talk about this on streams and reading about it here and in other subs.  People have been betting on the market to crash for the last 7 weeks and they've been right. For 7 weeks. But now, we're starting to see a reversal and the question is whether it will continue. Admittedly, it might not.

Next up, let's look at the play I'm making and why I think it makes sense to play the reversal this way or in a similar way at another strike.  TLDR: Feel free to let me know if you think there is a better play somewhere else.

This play is kind of a hail mary but it's a well CALCULATED hail mary and honestly, it's incredibly cheap.  A 460 call is currently a whopping 0.160.  Nobody in their right mind thinks SPY will hit 460 at any point in the near future. IV is only 18.98 %.  Relatively speaking, compared to all the put contracts this is a great deal. Take a look for yourself.  The picture below shows puts at a similar distance from the current price of 415 as 460 is.  Everything is 30% or higher. I'm not saying buy the calls simply because they're a great deal, I'm saying I'm buying the calls because not only are they cheap but I think there is a great possibility we keep ripping and we actually get there.

&amp;#x200B;

Want some technicals?  Here's the graph. Those trend lines terminate at 360. If we continue on the same path as we've been going, the June 22nd 460 call contracts will be IN THE MONEY before June 7th.

https://preview.redd.it/4gwp83jo0d291.png?width=802&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2416ad7dbb416e1289f6aa7336924b790ccac53b

We've been seeing moves as big as 3-4% up or down, right? I'm looking back at SPY and I'm seeing moves as big as 20 points in 2 days (from close the day before, to open the day after).  Keep in mind, I'm not saying we WILL get to where these contracts need to be in order for them to be profitable, but if we see some short covering or if retail earnings and economic data come out positive/positive, why wouldn't we see another move of 3-4% up on Tuesday into Wednesday? If we end anywhere between 427 and 430 (3-4% move) by the 2nd (2 trading days), the 6/22 460c will be worth $15-30 based on what I'm seeing here. This is per contract so multiply the profit by the number of contracts you buy.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hj8bb3mo8d291.png?width=788&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=429a9c3fbff547aaa768ff336dc7616165c421e8

In order to track the progress of these moves I put together a VERY simple excel chart.  Take a look.  It tracks how far SPY needs to go, day by day, weekends included, in order to stay on pace to hit 460 by the 22nd.  This is our break-even.  If we start to go below our break even, we bail.  If it keeps ripping, we either buy more or hold.

&amp;#x200B;

Me personally?  I picked up 10 contracts middle of last week and I'm already up 50%.  Between you and me, that's my profit target for my daily plays, but this?  I think I want to hold out for more than a $60 gain.  How about you?

# [Stock futures fall as investors await Fed update](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/24/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures were lower Wednesday after a sharp decline in the Nasdaq Composite during the previous session, while traders awaited the Federal Reserve’s release of its policy meeting from earlier this month.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell just 12 points, or less than 0.1%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures traded marginally higher.
*****
&gt; Nordstrom shares jumped more than 9% in extended trading after the retailer surpassed sales expectations and raised its full-year outlook. The retailer experienced a surge in demand from shoppers refreshing their closets for “long-awaited occasions.”
*****
&gt; Homebuilder Toll Brothers also posted quarterly results that beat analyst expectations, sending the stock up more than 3% in the premarket.
*****
&gt; Wednesday’s moves came after downbeat session for the Nasdaq, which tumbled following a warning of slowing growth from social media company Snap.
*****
&gt; The tech-heavy composite fell 2.4% on Tuesday, while the S&amp;P 500 slid 0.8%. The Dow rose by 0.2% in a late-day reversal, despite falling as much as 1.6% earlier in the session.
*****
&gt; Snap’s warning dinged other social media and tech stocks, including Facebook parent Meta, Twitter, and Google parent Alphabet.
*****
&gt; “It tells me how much technology and comm services are still over-owned, right, because they’re the ones that are getting hit the hardest, and for good reason. Snap was really a big surprise for just about everybody,” Stephanie Link, chief investment strategist and portfolio manager at Hightower, said Tuesday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell.”
*****
&gt; “I think that we’re in just really challenging times. I’ve been saying we’re going to be in a choppy environment all year long because there are so many unknowns,” she continued.
*****
&gt; Traders will continue to parse through earnings reports this week to see how companies are handling inflationary pressures. Dick’s Sporting Goods is expected to report earnings Wednesday before the bell. Snowflake and Nvidia are set to post quarterly reports after the bell.
*****
&gt; On the economic front, investors are awaiting the latest meeting minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee. At the May 4 meeting, the Fed hiked rates by half a percentage point, with Chair Jerome Powell saying that inflation is “much too high and we understand the hardship it is causing. We’re moving expeditiously to bring it back down.”

95,DELL,"Luckin Coffee Analysis - Business, Comparisons, Big Upside and Significant Risks","Edit: As predicted here, Luckin turned profitable this quarter! I summarized a few points in addition to linking to the news release in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/LuckinCoffee/comments/uwp05b/the_firstever_overall_profitable_quarter/).

Update June 1st: Since I predicted the 1st profitable qtr ever and called for people to buy $LKNCY or at least give it a fair chance 9 days ago in this post, LKNCY has been up &gt;30% vs AAPL/GOOG/MSFT up an average of 0%  (same  as the major indices) during the same 9 days.

**Update June 3rd: Now LKNCY is up &gt;47% since my post 11 days ago ...**

First, if you believe Chinese stocks are uninvestable, no need to read further. But if like many of the HFs, you're (considering) dipping toes into overseas markets including China, pls do read on.

Note: I'm writing this due to Luckin reporting 2022Q1 ER tomorrow before market opens. I believe it will be the first qtr that it'll be overall profitable - a big turnaround!

**Introduction**

Luckin Coffee was the fastest company ever to go from incorporation to Nasdaq listing, and in as fast a fashion imploded and got delisted after [an accounting fraud](https://sevenpillarsinstitute.org/case-study-luckin-coffee-accounting-fraud/) was exposed. But instead of rolling over and die, Luckin came roaring back by paying fines and restitution (restructured debt, and reached agreements with class action plaintiffs); on the business side, it started increasingly fast expansion after a few months of freezing, and overtook Starbucks China as #1 coffee chain in China in store count. Impressively it's grown revenue 100% in 2021 and reduced its operating loss by nearly 80%. It also boasts an ever-increasing portfolio of popular drinks and more customers than ever; On capital market side, further signs suggest that it is striving to become relisted on Nasdaq.

In fact, yesterday Fortune just wrote [a very long article](https://fortune.com/2022/05/22/luckin-coffee-china-wall-street-listing-nasdaq-scandal-fraud-starbucks/) on Luckin, following a very informative [Financial Times article](https://www.ft.com/content/f8327af5-5203-44fd-acc7-267c7b475fa7) published earlier in the year. There's no denying that there is certainly renewed interest in this shamed company. For more background pls read these articles. I'll move on to analysis and comparison.

**Business**

After fraud was reported in Apr 2020, Luckin coffee did not expand and instead started closing shops soon after. Other than a short-lived huge boost of ""sales"" (really it's only people with coupons rushing to redeem), its sales were declining significantly. However, Jingyi Guo and his team, after shaking out the fraudsters from the company which included Lucking Founder Zhengyao Lu, CEO Zhiya Qian and COO Jian Liu, among others, methodically rescued the sinking ship, and in fact, now made it prosper. It achieved this through multiple measures: 1. Watch expenditure. It shut down shops with bad location/low sales. Did away with most of the ads expenditure in 2020. Reduced coupon % vastly. 2. More careful expansion. After initial shop-closing, Luckin expanded again, but at a more careful pace and better locations. It also reserved top and second-tier cities to its own shops, while opening 3rd- to 5th-tiers to franchisees, who helped take financial risks of expansion off. 3. Develop popular drinks. The team under Guo had been extremely good at developing popular drinks. First they came out with “厚乳拿铁 (heavy milk latte)"", then ""生椰拿铁 (raw coconut latte)"", then ""丝绒拿铁 (silk latte)"", and now ""椰云拿铁 (coconut cloud latte)"", among many other popular drinks. The Raw Coconut Latte set a record of selling 100 million cups in less than a year! The silk latte set a one-week sales record when it came out and remained a heavy favorite among customers. The coconut cloud latte refreshed the weekly record and sold out quickly in many shops. 4. Its marketing is more nimble and smarter now. Instead of signing big names in entertainment industry, it signed younger and more promising actresses (also planting ads into popular TV/NetTV series) or promising athletes (Eileen Gu, one year before she earned two golds and a silver in Beijing Winter Olympics). It co-marketed Coconut Cloud Latte with the #1 coconut brand in China. Its ROI on marketing $ was much better now.

To see how well Luckin is doing, please look at the following tables.

**Luckin over the last 3 years despite the pandemic**:

|Luckin Coffee|2019|2020|2021|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Self-owned shops|4507|3929|4397|
|Franchises|282|874|1627|
|Self shop revenue|3.09B|3.72B|6.66B|
|Franchise revenue|0.02B|0.32B|1.31B|
|Operating expenses|6.24B|6.62B \*|8.50B|
|Operating Income|\-3.21B|\-2.59B|\-0.54B|
|Net Income|\-3.16B|\-5.60B \*|\+0.69B \*\*|
|Cash at hand|4.87B|4.81B|8.38B|
|Liabilities|4.62B \*|6.60B \*|7.17B \*|

\* Numbers included cost of restructuring and notes/fines/settlements

\*\* 2021 Net Income included SEC fine added back (due to class action settlement), thus positive. Operating income more important

**Comparison of 2021Q4 of similar chains (SBUX, BROS ...) - YoY growth % in paranthesis**:

||Luckin Coffee|StarBucks China|Dutch Bros|Nayuki (2021 Full Year!!)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenue|2.43B (80.7%)|$0.9B (-2%)|$0.14B (55.8%)|4.3B (40.5%)|
|Operating Income|\-0.12B|? likely a loss|\-$0.01B|0.07B|
|Self-store #|4397 (12%)|5557 (14%)|241 (54%)|817 (66%)|
|Franchise #|1627 (86%)|0|262 (2%)|0|
|Same-store Rev|43.6% \*|\-14%|10.1%|&lt;10%|
|MC/ Sales \*\*|2.0 @ $8.2|2.7 @ $73.4|9.5 @ $31.8|1.6 @ HK$4.79 HKEX \^|

\* Luckin's incredible same-store sales growth was due to highly popular and ever-expanding drinks, better name recognition, and striking a great balance between price and quality. That is despite that Starbucks China kept blaming its drop in sales on COVID - even though Luckin and Starbucks share all the cities in the top tiers and &gt;95% overall. Luckin simply executed better, and its models survives better in the modern times.

\*\* MC/Sales is calculated using current market cap vs 2021 full year sales. For Starbucks it's calculated using the entire SBUX, not Starbucks China only.

\^ HKEX has lower liquidity and usually supports lower MCs. I added Nayuki anyhow because it's also a Chinese public company offering drinks (tea, milk tea etc).

**Conclusion for Business**

As you can see, Luckin is growing tremendously fast, improving on revenue (&gt;80%), store # (&gt;25%), same-store revenue (&gt;43%), at the same time vastly improving its margins and reducing operating loss. Based on its progress over 2021, it's highly likely that tomorrow's 2022Q1 ER will show the first overall profitable quarter!

Luckin is growing revenue and improving margin much faster than even Dutch Bros, but has a PS that's only 1/5 of BROS! Nayuki's issue is that it's experiencing growing pains - deteriorating margins and struggling with new stores' sales and profits, thus its growth in revenue had been slowing while profit dropping, and HK capital market generally supports less liquidity and lower MC. So Nayuki dropped from HK$19.2 IPO to now $4.8 as its slowing growing and deteriorating profit margin got severely punished. But Luckin grows way faster than SBUX and Nayuki and is turning profitable soon, yet its PS showed no respect for its high growth and margin improvement.

**Projected Fair Value**

The best way to figure this out is by comparison. Luckin is highly similar to BROS and Dunkin Donut (now private but had a PS &gt; 6 before privatization with an annual revenue growth of about high single digit to low double). Luckin is expected to continue to improve same-store revenue and overall revenue (due to expansion) at a slower clip but still super speedy (a wide range would be 30-50%) for years (it is rumored to already plan to expand abroad, starting with some Asian countries, either Middle East or SEA). A fair PS for Luckin without the risk factors to be discussed below should be at least 8. BROS post profit warning still has a PS &gt;= 7.5. **A PS = 8 for TTM would put Luckin share price at $33 for now or $45 at end of 2022 on projected 2022 revenue**. Due to the expansion, Luckin share price likely will have a compounded growth of &gt;20-35% for possibly a few years. Any delayed realization of its fair share price now will likely lead to faster SP growth in the future when risks are resolved (like HFCAA, market condition improves)

**Risk Factors and Remedies**

1. Being a Chinese stock. We all know KWEB (Chinese internet company ETF) dropped 70% due to various factors: Chinese regulatory pressure/uncertainty; HFCAA delisting threat in 2024; US-China relationship deterioration; Worries that Chinese stocks would follow Russian stocks if China gets sanctioned.
2. Being an OTC stock. Luckin is still OTC Pink, so many funds who can't invest in OTC stocks won't be able to buy it. Robinhood still doesn't allow buying most OTC stocks.
3. Concentrated ownership. Centurium now owns &gt;20% of all shares and &gt;50% voting rights. It might scare some funds away when one fund has such a big say in a company.
4. Chinese economy concerns - due to regulatory issues and lockdown worries.
5. What if Luckin lies again?

However, much of the risk factors are remedied, being remedied, or will likely get remedied:

1. Chinese regulatory pressure was lifted mostly this year. Chinese economy was slowing, putting pressure on the government to stop its clamping down on capital investment, real estate and other markets. It also made Chinese regulators an active participant in HFCAA negotiation with US counterparts. Since late Dec. 2021, we've heard multiple times from Chinese officials promising a satisfactory result negotiating HFCAA, and it led to at least 2-3 decent rallies in Chinese stocks. Not fully resolved, but promising. China is also backing away from its support of Russia in some ways and reducing tension on that front. The mid March concern that Chinese stock will follow Russian's are mostly gone. Now it's mostly about HFCAA.
2. Luckin won't always be on OTC. In its [most recent statement](https://investor.luckincoffee.com/news-releases/news-release-details/company-statement) denying seeking HK listing, it more than hinted at its working at relisting in US (most likely Nasdaq). While relisting takes quite a while, Luckin has at least done a lot towards that: It emerged from Bankruptcy, settled debt, settled class action lawsuit (will likely get finalized in July), paid fines, kicked out all fraudsters in the company, Centurium even bought all the shares owned by the fraud-creating founder so he's not only not in the company, but doesn't own part of the company either, multiple measures implemented to address corporate governance weakness to prevent fraud again. It pretty much addressed the 2 main issues that Nasdaq listed when it booted Luckin. So while it still takes time, relisting would be Luckin's next step.
3. Centurium's ownership is concerning, but it's done a lot to make sure Luckin survives and thrives. Without Centurium, Luckin would've rolled over and died in 2020 already. So Centurium's interest is tied with Luckin, and with its stake, its best chance at making money is to make sure Luckin can do well, make amends, appease all investors so it can get back to Nasdaq. So Centurium's goals are aligned with ours - even though we cannot fully rule out that if things don't go well, Centurium has a chance to find enough votes to take Luckin private (however, not only that takes 67% total votes, but they need 90% votes to force others to sell the shares to them. Not to mention that if the price isn't good, we can sue them. Michael Dell was sued and lost when he tried to take Dell private with a low price). So this risk factor isn't as bad as it sounds.
4. Chinese government is concerned over its slowing economy amid lockdowns. It is slowly but surely reopening cities and stimulating real estate market and lending through lower rates. It stopped clamping down markets and even have extremely high ranking officials came out and said China welcome its companies to go IPO domestically and in US. I have confidence that China realized the mistake of last year that sent investors fleeing Chinese stock and Chinese market. Things are getting better. Chinese vaccination rate is improving fast after Shanghai lockdown. It is possible that in the future strict lockdown is no longer needed. Also Luckin was doing quite well in cities not locked down, and it has locations in about 400 cities as I remember - even though Shanghai has more Luckin shops than other cities. Moreover, US economy growth is now in doubt due to high inflation, a very tight labor market, rate hikes, QT reducing liquidity (we already saw the a volatility even without QT), and sad realization that inflation might not be eradicated by hikes/QT but could come back when Feds have to ease again to avoid recession. China suddenly doesn't look so bad any more - risky but will quite possibly grow faster than US for at least the near future. This is why many funds are investing in the markets abroad again including the battered Chinese stocks. The Chinese stock market rebounded 10% in the last month or so due to such expectations (more accommodative environment leads to higher growth/recovery from lockdowns).
5. Nothing is gonna prevent any company from lying. But like I said, Luckin already kicked all fraudsters out and implemented measures to prevent similar thing happen again. Moreover, because its business can relatively easily be monitored (Muddy Waters sent people to their shops to count sales and got receipts to get per-cup price and identified the fraud), same measure is being done by dozens of volunteers who live in China on XueQiu (Snowball) and Stocktwits to monitor Luckin's sales. Their reports checked out well with Luckin's post-fraud ER. I also personally monitors Chinese social media and news reports. And recent FT, Fortune etc reports were all convinced that Luckin's business is thriving. It really is. And frankly, with all eyes on Luckin, it is the least likely Chinese/US company to cook its books because if it does it again, everyone in the company will lose their great job at the thriving business. Why do that? Other companies might commit a fraud and get by but not Luckin. They do it again, they're dead. They don't have anything to gain. Nothing is 100% but the cross examination by multiple ways is making sure they're very clean.

**Final Words**

Luckin is still a risky stock and won't jump to anywhere near $33 yet due to the remaining unresolved risks. However, given its industry, growth, and how well it's being run by the current management and product development team, it might offer the best risk/reward ratio given how depressed its valuation is compared to peers growing at similar rate with similar profit margins. If you have a cardinal rule that you don't invest in Chinese stocks or stocks with fraud before, then OK skip it. Otherwise it's a stock that you don't want to just dismiss or miss. Do your own DD and decide if you'd like to invest. The next 3 positive events for Luckin: Lockdown truly ends for Shanghai and large cities, 2022 Q1 ER, possible HFCAA resolution, will all give stock price a boost. Chinese regulators have been saying they're confident agreement will be reached in or before June, let's see.

Disclaimer: I'm not affiliated with Luckin in any way. I do own Luckin shares however. I do insane amount of DD on this stock and it's the #1 stock in my portfolio.

23,DELL,Broadcom reportedly in talks to buy VMware,"Chip maker Broadcom Inc. is in negotiations to buy enterprise cloud-computing company VMware Inc., according to multiple reports Sunday night. Bloomberg News, Reuters, the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal reported the ongoing talks but did not mention a purchase price; as of Friday, VMware had a market cap of about $40.3 billion, while Broadcom was valued at about $222 billion. The reports said talks are ongoing, and it’s possible no deal will be reached. 

San Jose, Calif.-based Broadcom has reportedly been seeking a major software acquisition for some time; its last major deal was the nearly $11 billion purchase of Symantec Corp.’s enterprise security business in 2019. Broadcom bought Brocade Communications in 2016 for $5.9 billion and CA Inc. in 2018 for about $18 billion.

“M&amp;A has played a central role in Broadcom’s growth strategy and this transaction represents the next logical step in our strategy,” Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan said after the Symantec deal in 2019. Broadcom topped Wall Street’s estimates when it reported fiscal first-quarter earnings in March. The company is scheduled to report second-quarter earnings June 2.

Last year, Dell Technologies Inc. DELL, -2.55% finally spun off its majority stake in VMware. In its last earnings report in February, Palo Alto, Calif.-based VMware beat earnings expectations but lowered its outlook for the current quarter. It is scheduled to report first-quarter earnings on Thursday. Broadcom shares are down 18% year to date, while VMware is down 17%, roughly in line with the S&amp;P 500’s SPX, +0.01% 18% decline this year.

96,DELL,For those who think popular tech stocks always bounce back quickly,"Look up Cisco.   It was the AAPL of the 90s.

Also, look up charts of BIG TECH like Intel Dell Lucent Yahoo.

97,DELL,HP’s stock rockets after Berkshire Hathaway reveals 11% stake,"Shares of HP Inc. surged in after-hours trading Wednesday after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. disclosed that it had taken a large stake in the Silicon Valley maker of personal computers and printers. 

Berkshire BRK.A, +0.19% BRK.B, -0.03% disclosed in a late Wednesday filing that it owned 120.95 million shares of HP HPQ, -3.03% after buying shares in recent days. That position is worth about $4.2 billion and represents a roughly 11% stake in the company. The stock rose nearly 10% in after-hours trading.

“HP is committed to one of the largest share-repurchase programs (relative to market cap) within our coverage, so we think Berkshire’s involvement makes sense,” Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani wrote in a note to clients.

While he said he didn’t believe that Berkshire’s investment in HP would drive significant changes to HP’s business, he deemed the high-profile stake a “validation of HPQ’s strategy/capital return program,” noting that Berkshire began purchasing shares after HP announced plans to purchase the workplace-technologies company Poly for $3.3 billion late last month.

Berkshire’s HP stake indicates that Buffett sees value in HP’s business, though several analysts have sounded cautious lately on the market for personal computers following a pandemic-driven boom.

99,DELL,"One year ago, I wrote a bear case for AMD. Let's review.","**About me:** I like to write about semiconductor companies and tech stocks. My previous analysis (examples: [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/stzcql/google_announces_privacy_changes_to_android_that/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ss5w5r/big_cloud_winner_will_be_based_on_who_can_make/), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/sndmzr/softbanks_arm_to_ipo_buyers_beware/), [4](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/sjkieh/why_fb_is_investing_so_heavily_into_vr_if_it_isnt/)) have been upvoted to the top of /r/stocks or near the top. I noticed that Wallstreet tends to be very late on seeing future trends of chipmakers, which allowed me to make a decent profit. For example, it was only last week when Barclays downgraded AMD on competitive trends. I first warned about this exact same thing, in more detail around a year ago.

I also recommended Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, TSMC, Amazon over AMD. This recommendation has done well as they've collectively been much better than AMD. I believe these companies will continue to beat AMD over the long run. By long run, I mean next 3 years.

Note that I rode AMD from $12 to around $80. Then I switched out to the above companies based on the thesis below. It has done extremely well for me.

**Original post:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD\_Stock/comments/kg4e8j/is\_amd\_the\_king\_of\_the\_titanic\_x86/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/kg4e8j/is_amd_the_king_of_the_titanic_x86/)

The basic premise was that the computing industry as a whole is moving away from a duopoly (often monopoly) of Intel and AMD. x86 chips (which is what AMD and Intel make) are being replaced at a rapid rate on servers, and Apple Silicon jump-started the switch at the laptop and desktop level.

AMD was fortunate enough to catch Intel's pants down and it was fortunate enough to be making GPUs during the crypto boom.

But when the dust settles, AMD's future looks bleak.

Let's review some of my predictions below with comments in **bold**.

\---------

Most people here focus on AMD vs Intel or AMD vs Nvidia like it's still 2010.

In 2021, it's AMD vs Intel, Nvidia, ARM, Apple, Microsoft, Qualcomm, Google, Baidu, Tencent, Ampere, Nuvia.

It's tough to see an exponential trend when you're at the beginning. This post spells out the trends for all AMD markets.

**ARM Attack on consumer x86 market:**

* x86 market shrank by 10% the moment Apple announced a full transition to ARM **True. Apple Silicon is both faster, and far more efficient than AMD's very best chips today. Apple's Macs are growing extremely fast as a result.**
* Even worse, Apple is the forcing function for PC software makers to [support ARM](https://www.docker.com/blog/apple-silicon-m1-chips-and-docker/), paving the way for Windows ARM **True. A ton of software makers have developed ARM versions in the last 2 years.**
* Microsoft has just announced [x86 emulation on their Windows ARM OS](https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2020/12/10/introducing-x64-emulation-in-preview-for-windows-10-on-arm-pcs-to-the-windows-insider-program/) **Windows 11 ARM can now emulate x86 apps. Paving the way for ARM CPU makers on Windows.**
* Apple's entry-level [M1](https://browser.geekbench.com/macs/macbook-pro-13-inch-late-2020) is faster than [4900HS](https://browser.geekbench.com/processors/amd-ryzen-9-4900hs) by 55% in single-core and 3.7% in multi-core while using 5x less power. You can buy an M1 laptop today while the 4900HS is a highly binned-part.
* Apple's entry-level iGPU blows away the very best AMD iGPU
* Apple's ARM chip allows the entry-level Macbook Pro to have 20 hours of battery life while staying extremely cool
* Apple is readying [8,16, 32 core SoCs](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-07/apple-preps-next-mac-chips-with-aim-to-outclass-highest-end-pcs). For reference, M1 has only 4-high performance cores.
* Apple is poised to [significantly increase PC market-share](https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/02/kuo-two-macbook-pros-2021-and-macbook-air-2022/), 100% within 3 years. **On pace.**
* In order to compete, PC makers like Dell, Lenovo, and HP will increasingly look to ARM alternatives
* Microsoft is working on in-house ARM chips for Surface **Yes. They hired Apple ARM architect. They're planning ARM chips for Azure as well.**
* Qualcomm is expected to become [a serious player](https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21409500/qualcomm-8cx-gen-2-5g-chips-arm-window-laptops-ifa-2020) in the laptop space **Yes. They bought Nuvia for $1.4 billion to focus on laptops (as the first market).**

**ARM Attack on hyperscalers market:**

* AWS's Graviton2 workload increased by 10x last year. In just one year, Graviton2 is now [10% of all AWS CPU](https://twitter.com/LucidCap/status/1338208878278926338) workloads. **In 2020, Graviton2 accounted for 50% of all new EC2 instances. It's likely much more in 2022. Amazon just announced Graviton3.**
* Like Apple in consumer market, Amazon is the forcing function for better ARM server software support **Yes. Almost all popular server software now have ARM versions.**
* Amazon will most certainly prioritize in-house designs over x86 chips. In the future, Amazon will likely offer x86 only for legacy software. **Looking like it. Look up Graviton3. Amazon is all in.**
* AWS controls 40% of the cloud. If AWS moves most of its future workload to its own CPUs, then AMD can control at best 60% of what Intel used to contol.
* In house ARM chips allow hyperscalers to differentiate, save on cost, and build chips tailored to their unique challenges
* Microsoft is designing its own ARM cloud chips **Yes**
* You can expect Google, Baidu, Tencent to follow soon **Yes. Alibaba, Tencent both launched custom ARM chips for their clouds. Baidu will soon as well. Google has signaled that they will be developing custom ARM chips for their cloud.**
* Hyperscalers don't want to be controlled by a duopoly. If Intel isn't grabbing them by the balls, then it's just AMD. It's the same thing. Hyperscalers want to control their own destiny and ARM allows them to.

**ARM Attack on small size cloud companies:**

* Ampere will allow smaller cloud companies to buy into ARM **If Ampere was a public company, I'd be buying a lot.**
* Anandtech just said that Ampere's latest 80-core chip is [42% better than Epyc](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16315/the-ampere-altra-review/9) in terms of cost/performance
* Ampere is releasing a 128-core chip in 2021
* Anandtech says Ampere's 2022 N1 Neoverse chip could be 50% faster at minimum
* Very well-funded startup Nuvia is also competing here **Bought by Qualcomm to bring ARM to Windows laptops**

**GPUs:**

* Apple will no longer use AMD GPUs in their computers. Bloomberg reports that Apple is testing [64-core and 128-core GPUs](https://videocardz.com/newz/apple-reportedly-developing-high-end-32-core-cpus-and-128-core-gpus). For reference, M1 has 8 GPU cores.
* Nvidia's grip on server GPUs and AI is tight and AMD has a mountain to climb in order to catchup
* With ARM, Nvidia can now offer complete server units from CPU to GPU to interconnects, just like AMD **Although the ARM deal fell through, Nvidia introduced their Grace CPU which they claim is faster than and more efficient than anything AMD offers.**
* Intel is joining the cloud GPU competition, and they're expected to use TSMC to manufacture Xe GPUs. **True**

**Consoles:**

* Mobile gaming is now [3x bigger than consoles](https://newzoo.com/insights/articles/global-games-market-reaches-137-9-billion-in-2018-mobile-games-take-half/)
* Consoles are a low-margin business
* It's quite possible that PS5/Xbox Series X are the last consoles ever if AAA gaming moves to the cloud in the next 6-7 years

**TSMC:**

* As more companies move to in-house designs, competition for TSMC wafers are expected to increase significantly
* Apple is likely to continue to hold a node advantage lead because they have a lot more cash and a lot more volume. Apple's volume will likely increase significantly with Apple Silicon Macs. Ming-Chi Kuo expects Apple to sell 35 million Macs/year by 2023.
* Unlike Intel, AMD does not have a node advantage over Qualcomm, Ampere, Nuvia, Nvidia, Amazon, Microsoft, etc.
* Intel is expected to [make a decision](https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4067508) on whether they will invest in their 7nm process node in Spring of 2021 or use TSMC. If Intel decides to go fabless instead, AMD will lose its node advantage over Intel and wafer prices will increase for everyone. **Semi-true.** **Intel will use TSMC 3nm AND continue to develop their 7nm node (renamed to Intel 4). This means Intel will be competing with AMD for TSMC wafers and will continue to build out their own fab.**

**If you're buying into AMD long-term, you have to believe that:**

* AMD will become a monopoly in the x86 market in record time **Not going to happen. Intel's Alder Lake has the performance crown now and better architecture. While Zen4 will be better, Intel is incredibly aggressive with its roadmap.**
* Intel will not switch to TSMC and does not fix its node issues. Basically, you expect Intel to do nothing. **Intel's Alder Lake is a huge return to the performance crown.**
* AMD can make enough progress in Zen to delay the inevitable full ARM dominance
* AMD is working on ARM chips now, or will buy Ampere/Nuvia to enter the ARM race **Nuvia already bought by Qualcomm**
* Wall Street will respond well if AMD decides to go ARM and bet against their own cash cow: Epyc
* AMD can eventually compete with Nvidia in GPUs/AI
* AMD takes a big piece of the cloud gaming pie
* Consoles will have another generation after PS5/Xbox
* Microsoft, Google, Baidu, Tencent, Qualcomm, Nuvia, Nvidia, Intel fail to compete with Zen and Radeon

**My personal recommendation:**

* You can own AMD
* You're crazy if you're still all-in on AMD
* You should diversify your portfolio with TSMC, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Nvidia **This suggestion proved to be wise. AMD is getting downgraded while Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia continue to soar. Amazon is doing well. TSMC is ok.**",711,292,1648964185.0,2022-04-03T05:36:25+00:00,t3_tv20la,stocks

# [Dow and S&amp;P 500 futures are little changed as Wall Street gets set to end a wild quarter](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/30/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures were little changed in early morning trading Thursday as traders wrap up a month and quarter.
*****
&gt; Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 26 points, or less than 0.1%. S&amp;P 500 futures were flat, and Nasdaq 100 futures added 0.2%.
*****
&gt; Some tech stocks were under pressure Thursday amid analysts concerns over the PC market going forward. AMD shares slipped more than 1% in the premarket after analysts at Barclays downgraded the stock to equal weight from overweight. Meanwhile, HP Inc and Dell dipped 3.8% and 2%, respectively, after being downgraded to equal weight from overweight at Morgan Stanley.
*****
&gt; Oil prices fell sharply, with West Texas Intermediate futures dropping 5% to $102.18 per barrel. That comes as President Joe Biden’s administration considers a plan to release 1 million barrels of oil per day from the strategic petroleum reserve for about six months, a source told NBC News.
*****
&gt; Volatile oil prices have loomed over equities, with U.S. crude prices climbing more than 3% on Wednesday. Germany warned of potential rationing of natural gas due to disputes with Russia, and U.S. crude stockpiles fell.
*****
&gt; “We’re going to be bouncing around between good news and bad news, unfortunately,” said George Mateyo, Key Private Bank chief investment officer. “That’s going to create some volatility.”
*****
&gt; Thursday marks the last trading day of March and of the first quarter.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq are on pace to finish the month up about 5% each, while the Dow is nearly 4% higher in March. For the first quarter, the Dow and S&amp;P 500 are both down about 3% and the Nasdaq is off more than 7%.
*****
&gt; Those moves come as traders grapple with the Federal Reserve’s plans to tighten monetary policy this year to fight a spike in U.S. inflation, while the Ukraine-Russia war rages on.
*****
&gt; Investors are awaiting weekly jobless claims and personal income and spending data to be released Thursday morning.
*****
&gt; Stocks are coming off a down session Wednesday in which the Dow and S&amp;P 500 each snapped four-day win streaks. The Dow shed 65.38 points, or 0.2%. The S&amp;P 500 fell 0.6% and the Nasdaq lost 1.2%.

102,DELL,Dell analysis and valuation - The transformed free cash flow generator ($Dell),"Dell is a company that had quite a transformative journey over the last decade and today has a market cap of almost $40bn. I'll try to keep this post as short as possible while providing the key information that I think is relevant.

**The transformation**

**The 2000s** \- Dell was the market leader, but as we all know, the PC industry was disrupted by the invention of smartphones and tablets. This had an impact on the demand for the main products that Dell was selling

**2013 -** Dell decided to go from public back to a private company and start its transformation

**2015** \- EMC acquired for $67 billion, mainly funded by debt.

**2018** \- Dell is back as a public company

So, we have a company that was disrupted and decided to transform and there's a good story behind it. Instead of selling certain hardware, why not provide additional solutions, become a one-stop shop and leverage the relationships with the existing customers. Of course, there was a price to pay, so looking at today's Dell, it is very different compared to Dell back in 2013.

The EMC acquisition was a huge step and comparing the purchase price ($67b) to Dell's current market cap ($40b), gives us a good insight into the significance of this transaction. This is still the largest tech acquisition to this date.

**The structure**

The company has two main reporting segments:  
Segment #1 - Client Solutions Group (the segment that is related to the sale of hardware in the form of desktops, workstations, notebooks, and peripherals) - This segment grew from $40b in 2017 to $60b in 2021, but the majority of the growth came in 2021 (partly due to price increases).

Segment #2 - Infrastructure Solutions Group (related to the sale of storage solutions, servers, data protection, networking) - This segment hasn't experienced huge growth over the last 5 years and it went up from $30b to $35b, however, has a bit higher margin than the first one.

Last year, they also had a third segment related to VMware, but as it was divested, it doesn't add any value to make this post longer, so will skip that for now.

**The debt**

Being aware of the huge debt they raised back in 2015, one of the main targets of the management was to reduce it over time. In the last report (year ending January 2022), the outstanding debt was close to $27b (excluding capital leases). This amount was significantly reduced with the divestment of VMware ($38b the year before).

**The dividend**

Recently, the company announced that they've decided to be a dividend-paying company and the dividend yield on today's price is around 2.5%. Every time that I see this decision, I look at it as a signal/admission that the company is generating enough free cash flow after covering all of its operating expenses as well as making the debt-payments, but as they don't have a great option to invest in, it's best to return the cash back to the shareholders.

**The margin**

The company had $100b in revenue in the last twelve months ($5b come from VMware which is divested), with an operating margin of around 5%. However, there's almost a 2% expense on the income statement related to the amortization of goodwill. In my valuation, I am forecasting the free cash flow, so I'm adding this back as it is a non-cash movement. As for the depreciation/amortization of the assets that they need to replace over time, I'm leaving that amount in, assuming they'll need to reinvest roughly the same amount to keep the same level of business activity. Therefore, my assumption for the operating margin is 6.5% and doesn't change over time as based on the growth over time, it is fair to assume Dell is a mature company.

**The revenue growth**

I am assuming fairly low revenue growth (3% annually in the next 5 years, followed by a decline to the risk-free rate of 2%) which leads to revenue of $132b in 10 years.

**The reinvestment**

Although I've mentioned the reinvestments to maintain the same level of business activity, assuming the company grows from $95b for the last twelve months (the revenue excluding VMware) to $132b, they would need to make additional reinvestments. Historically, the Sales/capital ratio has been around 2, so I'm using the same assumption. For every $2 in revenue, I am expecting that Dell invests $1 in capital (whether that is PPE or inventory).

**The outcome**

With the current revenue of $100b and margin of 6.5%, the operating profit is $6.5b.

Assuming a tax rate of 25%, that goes down to almost $5b (without taking the tax impact of amortization of goodwill)

Based on the reinvestment rate, they'll be reinvesting around $1.5b per year, which leads to a free cash flow of roughly $3.5b - almost 9% of the current market cap.

I ran these assumptions through a DCF and the outcome was **$76.9**/share based on the risk it has.

The discount rate used was 6.7% based on WACC.

**What if the revenue and operating margin assumptions change?**

Below is a table that shows the fair value based on different assumptions about the future related to the revenue in 10 years from now and the operating margin:

&amp;#x200B;

|Revenue / Op. margin|5.5%|6.5%|7.5%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|22% ($123.4b)|$60.5|$74.9|$89.4|
|31% ($132.1b)|$61.6|$76.9|$92.3|
|40% ($141.9b)|$62.7|$79.1|$95.5|
|50% ($151.7b)|$63.9|$81.3|$98.7|

What you can see is that the revenue growth assumption doesn't have such a large impact on the fair value, but the operating margin has. So, if I'm to invest in Dell, I'll be more closely monitoring the change of the margin over time.

**This DD was written on too much Adderall.**

***I’ve decided to include the TL;DR of the TL;DR’s at the top, as a lot of you don’t like to read, please find this straight after the ‘What is Marvell?’ section.***

**What is Marvell?**

&gt; Here is what Carillon Tower Advisers has to say about Marvell Technology Group Ltd. in its Q4 2021 investor letter:

&gt; ""Marvell Technology provides infrastructure semiconductor solutions. Investors have recently appreciated the particularly strong growth the company has posted, as it is winning designs in the datacenter server market as well as winning notable contracts in the upcoming 5G wireless infrastructure build-outs. Supply chain issues had hampered growth in 2021 for the company, but with some improvements there recently, we believe Marvell is set to exhibit robust growth in the upcoming year.""

**Innovium Acquisition:**

Innovium develops and deploys it’s technologies to address the most challenging issues facing cloud and edge data centres. It specialises in advanced scalable Ethernet switch silicon, with the goal of providing clients with a single consistent scalable switch architecture that offers both high performance and a good feature set. It’s leading product is Teralynx, an Ethernet switch silicon family which delivers analytics, standards-based programmability, and power efficiency. This enables data centres and companies to deploy fewer network switches and tiers; thereby reducing cost, power and latency. Marvell adds engineering resources to innovate in cloud-optimised silicon through the Teralynx platform, to be named the Prestera 9K product series (Marvell also plans to advance its 2K and 8K product series which are aimed at the enterprise and carrier switch market).
 
The deal was completed in October 2021, it had a $1.1 billion price tag, including Innovium cash and exercise proceeds worth approximately $145 million. This resulted in a net cost to Marvell of $955 million. Innovium had an impressive market share of 29% in Q4 2020, and is the only company so far to challenge Broadcom which had a 70% market share. This acquisition allows Marvell to obtain a more substantial portfolio to face what lies ahead in networking (chiplets, onboard optics, and silicon photonics). It also allows it to grow ASIC market share, with more OEM/ODM ASIC choices, and increased innovation and R&amp;D in this market. Ethernet switches will be critical to deploying AI and Machine Learning, and other future workload technologies. Marvell can now complete more broadly against competitors such as Broadcom, Intel, AMD, ARM, Texas Instruments, and Microchip. Following the acquisitions of Inphi and Innovium, Broadcom and Intel will need to step up their game and directly respond, or risk falling behind the strong momentum Marvell has with hyperscalers and other cloud service providers. 
 
Now Marvell can target a wider range of chip-level cloud DC needs, including:

* Cloud-optimized Ethernet switches per the Innovium deal
* High-speed Electro-Optical PAM4 and Coherent DSP chipsets (Inphi)
* OCTEON-based DPUs for security, offload, and acceleration
* Custom Arm-based service CPUs
* Full custom ASICs
* Bravera Flash and HDD-based storage
* Pluggable COLORZ DCI modules
 
Innovium’s CTO and Founder Puneet Agarwall, with 20 years of experience in developing groundbreaking products, has joined Marvell following this acquisition. He will serve as an advisor to Marvell, and the talented Innovium team will continue to grow the cloud-optimised switch solutions that they provide. 
 
This acquisition has essentially further stepped up Marvell’s cloud data centre game, further developing their strength in the Ethernet switch semiconductor market, and allowing them to participate in the fastest growing segment of this market. Marvell has also secured Innovium’s channels throughout the merchant cloud semiconductor switching market. This acquisition is a move to target the biggest data centre spenders in the world, including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft and Google. 
 
&gt; “Data center capex spending by hyperscale operators—led by AWS, Microsoft, Google and Facebook— reached $38 billion in just the first quarter of 2021 alone, according to IT research firm Synergy Research Group.” (CRN)
 
&gt; *Marvell CEO statement:*

&gt; “Our acquisition of Innovium and its complementary offerings further extends Marvell’s leadership in the cloud, and I am excited that Innovium has secured significant share at a marquee cloud customer,” said Matt Murphy, President and CEO of Marvell. “Innovium has established itself as a strong cloud data center merchant switch silicon provider with a proven platform, and we look forward to working with their talented team who have a strong track record in the industry for delivering multiple generations of highly successful products.”

**Other Acquisitions:**

Throughout the years Marvell has acquired numerous companies, check the wikipedia for this.
 
**Marvell’s 5G exposure:**

Marvell will innovate in 5G through its acquisition of Inphi. Marvell optical interconnect solutions reliably move 100’s of gigabits per second, even over large distances (thousands of kilometers). Marvell has also been awarded numerous Supplier of the year awards by the world’s leading optical module companies.
 
Many carriers are choosing Marvell’s optical connectivity technology to meet stringent requirements in the 5G sector. Announced in 2017, the Polaris PAM4 DSP, which is Marvell’s foundation technology for 5G networks, has shipped millions of ports. Hyperscale data centres have been connected using Polaris by some of the world’s most demanding tier one cloud providers. Building on the success of Polaris, Marvell have recently released the AtlasOne PAM4 DSP.
 
&gt; “From Smart Cities to wireless industrial automation, to autonomous driving and good ‘old fashioned’ smartphone video or gaming, the fifth generation of wireless technology can truly transform how we live and work.  The ability of 5G to enable innovative new services and enhanced mobile broadband experiences requires increased transport bandwidth that connects all key elements in the data path from the radio tower, across the edge to the core network.  With superior performance, reliability and economies of scale proven with hyperscale data center operators, direct detect optics utilizing robust PAM4 modulation are playing an essential role in developing future-ready 5G infrastructure — today.” (Marvell)
 
*Marvell partners with Dell to bridge 5G Open RAN performance gap:*

Marvell and Dell have launched a solution to address the current performance challenges of Open RAN deployment in virtualized distributed unit environments. This accelerator card is used for servers in 5G networks. It was announced on the 22nd of February ahead of the Mobile World Congress (MWC) conference. Named the “Dell Open RAN Accelerator Card”, it uses Marvell’s Octeon. Octeon is a chip that handles networking and security chores. They can scale to 16 cores and are programmable. Octeon is often found in a network interface controller, and when loaded with modestly-powerful compute cores and a little storage these NIC’s become a SmartNIC. SmartNICs are now the standard for hyperscalers such s Alibaba, Baidu and Google/Alphabet. As they work to move data, SmartNICs are now described as data-processing units (DPUs), and are essential for demanding workloads like AI/ML. I will cover DPU’s in more detail later in this DD. 
 
With that information on Octeon, let's move back to the Accelerator Card. The use of Octeon enables the CPU’s housed in the PowerEdge servers used in 5G networks to be freed from processing Layer 1 traffic, hence allowing the CPU’s to focus on running the Open RAN. Freeing up the CPU for critical workloads, and instead using an accelerator to handle plumbing is the same reasoning Intel, Nvidia, Pensando, and most hyperscale clouds offer adding DPU’s to servers. 
 
The card, which is designed for Dell PowerEdge and other x86-based servers, also features PTP syncing, which enables various parts of a telco network to be synchronised. This thereby eliminates the need for additional modules in order to orchestrate the synchronisation. 
 
&gt; 'Speaking with ZDNet, Dell Technologies Asia Pacific and Japan head of telecom Sam Saba explained the Open RAN Accelerator Card has been designed to bring the performance of traditional RAN solution to Open RAN.
&gt; ""[There's] this gap of performance and energy consumption. Effectively, we believe now this card will bridge that performance,"" he said.
&gt;  ""The way we're doing this is through what we call the layer 1 offload. With that, we're looking at taking all that layer 1 processing out of the standard CPU that sits in the server, which occupies 60-70% of overall processing capacity … and putting it in a PCIe card in line into the virtual distributed unit close to the base station … in doing that we're effectively relieving, or releasing, a lot of the capacity in the standard processing card to do more processing.""’ (ZDNet)
 
&gt; ‘“Marvell is delighted to partner with Dell Technologies to enable an open, virtualised 5G RAN architecture that delivers advanced features and performance built on our proven OCTEON Fusion platform,” said Raj Singh, executive vice president, Processors Business Unit at Marvell.
 
&gt; “The new Dell Open RAN Accelerator Card is an innovative no-compromise, cloud-native, in-line, Open RAN Layer 1 acceleration solution that addresses the shortcomings of existing vRAN alternatives.”
 
&gt; “We’re pleased to see Dell Technologies and Marvell come together to innovate and create technologies that will enhance Open RAN platform capability and vendor diversity for operators,” said Andy Dunkin, Open RAN RF and digital platform development manager at Vodafone.
 
&gt; “The promise of virtualised Open RAN platforms will be enhanced with the Dell Open Ran Accelerator Card that should offer network operators like Vodafone a less costly and more efficient path to Open RAN.”
 
*‘Marvell Technology : showcases its new no-compromise Open RAN solution with ecosystem partners (ARM and Meta) using best of cloud, wireless compute architectures’ (marketscreener/Marvell):*
 
I could only find one article for this, but it appears that Marvell is also separately showcasing it’s Open RAN architecture (linked to the previously mentioned one, but not in collaboration with Dell. It appears the Dell card builds upon this technology). This uses its Octeon Fusion processor, and is in collaboration with ARM and Meta to drive adoption of 5G Open Ran solutions. Marvell’s new 5G Open RAN Accelerator will be on display at Mobile World Congress 2022, at the ARM booth. Marvell has extensive compute collaboration with ARM, and it is possible that this will increase Open RAN capabilities for ecosystem initiatives such as the Meta Connectivity Evenstar program, which is aiming to expand the global adoption of Open RAN.
 
5G is already a rapidly expanding technology, which is being rolled out by every major operator worldwide. 5G’s high bandwidth and low latency is powering applications such as the metaverse, autonomous driving, industrial Internet of Things (IoT), private networks and more. 5G is set to transform entire industries, serving the world’s connectivity needs for years. The networks themselves are undergoing changes in architecture, specifically, that significant portions of the 5G radio access network (RAN) are moving into the cloud. Hyperscale clouds as well as software defined networks, have accelerated innovation, value creation and growth across nearly every industry. It is a data centre revolution, where technologies such as virtualisation, disaggregation and open standards enable agility, efficiency and massive scalability. These benefits have great appeal to 5G carriers that are pursuing large growth opportunities in the industrial and enterprise markets. 
 
With disaggregation and open interfaces, carriers will also have the opportunity to evolve 5G RAN to a more flexible architecture which optimises bandwidth, power and cost, thereby allowing diverse network traffic conditions and advanced features such as a Massive MIMO.
 
The Evenstar program by Meta Connectivity is a collaborative industry effort working towards expanding the global adoption of Open RAN. Through a unified platform architecture, Evenstar removes interoperability risk and helps mobile network operators deploy Open RAN solutions. Meta Connectivity is collaborating with Marvell to optimise performance, cost and power efficiency in 5G Networks. 
 
&gt; “We at Marvell are proud of our collaborations with Arm and Meta Connectivity to facilitate 5G-Cloud convergence. Our no-compromise 5G Open RAN solution represents a big step forward. With open standards and proven, best-in-class RAN features and the virtualization and scaling techniques used in the most advanced clouds, we are helping to realize the promises of 5G and fuel our world with intelligent connectivity.” (Marvell)

This is one of Marvell’s smallest market segments, but Marvell is expecting to grow in this area due to increasing demand. Marvell offers a complete portfolio of Automotive Brightlane Ethernet PHY, tracievers, bridges and switches supporting speeds of 100Mbps to 10Gbps with enhanced safety and security features. These security features protect automotive networks from malicious attacks. This portfolio is described as a ‘One-stop shop for in-vehicle networking’ by Marvell.
 
In December 2021, Marvell introduced the industry’s first multi-gig Ethernet camera bridge solution. This is the latest addition to Marvell’s Brightlane automotive portfolio. The new bridge provides standardisation for in-vehicle distribution in multiple areas. 
 
&gt; “We are extending our leadership in Ethernet-based solutions to enable autonomous driving and usher in the next generation of automotive architectures,” said Will Chu, senior vice president and general manager of the Automotive Business Unit, Marvell. “Marvell’s newest Ethernet bridge solution builds on the introduction of our multi-gig 802.3ch Ethernet 10Gbps PHY, integrated with image sensor interface. The new Ethernet device underscores Marvell’s commitment to enabling smarter, safer and greener vehicles with innovative automotive networking, storage, compute and security semiconductor solutions.” (Marvell)
 
&gt; “Marvell’s Ethernet-based bridges are becoming an essential component for the software-defined cars of today,” said Ian Riches, vice president for the Global Automotive Practice, Strategy Analytics. “Not only do Ethernet-based products fit seamlessly into a zonal architecture, but with 802.3ch they are also proving to be an attractive alternative to the SerDes solutions currently used to transport video data in the vehicle.” (Marvell)
 
&gt; “Today’s high-speed long-distance camera to ECU communication are proprietary point-to-point protocols that narrow our customers’ design options, which is why they have been requesting a standardized protocol such as Ethernet,” said Stephen Harris, director of Automotive Systems Architecture at onsemi. “Marvell’s 88QB5224 is a single chip 10 Gbps standard Ethernet PHY solution that provides the fast speed needed to enable our portfolio of high-performance, ultra-dynamic range image sensors. onsemi has become the leader in automotive imaging by developing and supporting innovative solutions in this space and is excited to be an early adopter of 88QB5224 by adding it to our popular MARS (Modular Automotive Reference System) development platform.”  (Marvell)
 
The automotive industry suffered a significant decline in sales during the pandemic. Thereby decreasing demand for automotive ethernet. Manufacturing plants stopped production to avoid further losses, and governments of various countries banned import-export activities. Thereby hampering growth of this market. However, there are numerous factors expected to influence and increase growth in future. 
 
The automotive ethernet market size was $2.1 billion in 2021. It is forecasted to grow to $11.1 billion by 2030. Automotive ethernet can increase vehicle safety. Increasing consumer awareness and favourable government regulations pertaining to safety will likely have a positive impact on the market. The European Commission has also announced a new regulation related to the implementation of Intelligent Speed Assistance (ISA) for light vehicles. These factors increase market growth. 
 
Rising disposable income will also increase demand for luxury vehicles which offer advanced services (using automotive ethernet). Increasing popularity of ADAS, and the emergence of MEMS (Micro-electromechanical systems) will drive automotive ethernet market growth.  There are also trends such as the increasing demand of Internet of Things (IoT) in automotive. As well as the increasing demand for lightweight, electric and hybrid vehicles. Both these factors drive growth.

I am not here to rant on why tesla is obviously over-valued and how fundamentals don't mean shit to some of these stocks (I have Tesla calls, don't punish me).  


#  1 Timeline

Anytime between now and the market crashes, cool, isn't that what every stupid bear ever said. Let's just buy a shit ton of leaps and pray. No. It is much easier than that. The play i am trying to explain is a 6 month to 1 year timeframe. This gives the market enough time to slowly bleed and adjust to interest rate hikes, war nonsense, inflation, and balance sheet reduction.  


# 2 Catalysts

 Everyone says ""But stonks only go up"", ""These are down %50-%70 from ATH"". I am not looking at companies like $PYPL, $SQ which have fundamentals and make money. I am looking at companies that have no free cash flow, bad technicals, and make no money. Some of these have already came down a lot, but they have a long ways to go. With interest rate hikes and balance sheet reduction it will be extremely difficult for overvalued companies to get bonds and loans to increase their production or operations. How might this affect bigger companies that are not neccessarily overvalued, rather, blue chip growth stocks like GOOG and AAPL. They will certainly go down in the next 6 months to 1 year but will recover and hit more ATH in the near future. So stop buying puts on big tech and wondering why they won't react as bad as some others.   


# 3 The Play

**Lucid Motors, Rivian, Draft Kings, Beyond Meat are all trash can water and belong behind Wendy's with the rest of you retards buying OTM 0DTE on margin**  


How the hell is LCID a 20 billion dollar company, Rivian twice that size, and how is Beyond Meat still a public company.   


To the people who say they made bank 2020-2021 on these, congrats your calls printed but we are moving on with this rotation. There will not be anymore meme relevance or squeezes for these stocks. Look at how much they have already came down from ATH. There is so much more room to go down, it is obvious these can EASILY decrease %50 more. Remember when [Pets.com](https://Pets.com) was public and going crazy in 1999? Yeah it got delisted after the first bubble pop. THIS IS EXACLTY what is going to happen to some of these companies this year, and people cannot fathom how it will happen, because it will happen when we are not ready for it  


# 4 The bubble

 It is clear stocks are in a massive bubble based on their Price to Sale (P/S valuation). 

Warren Buffett  stated that his favorite means of valuing stock was the stock market capitalization to GDP ratio.

Below is a chart for this metric. As you can see, the stock market today is as overvalued relative to the economy as it was at the peak of the 1999 Tech Mania.  


https://preview.redd.it/k0pvdtigpmj81.png?width=460&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=376c74db877985f3878fab9ad2081981abc07816

 So stocks are overvalued based on the most reliable corporate data point (revenues) and they are also overvalued relative to the economy. Scratch that, they're not overvalued... they're **trading at 1999-Tech Bubble insanity levels**. 

This time the FED has created a **bubble in everything**. A ""risk-free rate"" of return against which ALL risk assets are valued. 

&amp;#x200B;

Comparing to 1999 tech bubble, 2008 housing market bubble, this will be considered the 2022 Digitial Currency/EV bubble. Look at the 10-20 year charts for any automotive company. It is not pretty. So what makes Rivian and LCID worth more than GM or Toyota? Nothing, since its a bubble. I will rule out Tesla on this one since we know damn well they make money, have an incredible CEO, and produce something tangible unlike these others. Tesla is still overvalued and it will go down with the digital currency/ev crash, but most likely not as hard as other competitors.   


# 5 Short Bull thesis counterargument

*""What if it takes 3 more years to crash these sectors? Look at Tesla in 2016, 2017, 2018 retard, you thought it was overvalued then, look how high it is now.""*   
Good point, but that's what a bubble is, and the government allowed companies to become overvalued by constantly printing money and rising inflation since before the pandemic so stocks could only go up and create this bubble we are currently in.   


*""How can you be so sure these will keep dropping?""*  
A stock can never hit 0 but can become pennies. Look at WISH, CLOV, and those aren't even penny stocks yet, or delisted, but a lot lower from what their overvalued price was WITHOUT interest rate hikes, and balance sheet reduction. We can be sure many of these will be delisted or go to single digits. I will explain which ones below  


6 Positions  
Mostly playing monthly to year puts to reduce Theta decay and try to let them expire when the market will most likely feel the change the most. Trying to not go so far OTM in case we see more short-term bull runs, as often these occur in bear markets as well. Tesla is more of a gamble since 250 seems incredibly unlikely, but so did most of the stocks in 2000 (DELL $60 to $2)

182,DELL,$DELL - A Sleeping Giant Primed for Inflation Proof Gains,"
**Edit: should’ve inversed myself.**


You probably missed the insane execution of Dell's management team or the fact that they're undervalued given their position in the market and current multiples. 

""Dell Technologies Inc. designs, develops, manufactures, markets, sells,  and supports Information technology solutions, products, and services  worldwide."" - Fidelity

My thesis is that this company is undervalued when compared to their peers and especially when compared to their earnings. They also have pricing power so increase in input costs and goods is going to be easily passed on to consumers. 

**TL DR: Old schools is new school. Dell is making bank and unnoticed by the average investor.**

&amp;#x200B;

Let's start by comparing multiples in the industry and where we stand. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Let's Look At Some PE**
   1. Dell: 7
   2. HP (HPQ): 7.1
   3. Seagate Technologies (STX): 14.1
   4. Hewlet Packard Enterprise (HPE): 6.8
2. **How about Price to Sales?** 
   1. Dell: .6
   2. HPQ: .4
   3. HPE: .4
   4. STX: 1.2
3. **Price to Cash Flow**
   1. Dell: 6.4
   2. HPQ: 6.5
   3. HPE: 4.8
   4. STX: 9.0
4. **Price to Free Cash Flow**
   1. Dell: 5.9
   2. HPQ: 6.5
   3. STX: 9.0
   4. HPE: -14.6
5. **Return on Equity**
   1. Dell: 131.1
   2. HPQ: -127.6
   3. HPE: -2.0
   4. STX: 56.2

**Let's take a look at market capitalization (billion).** 

1. Dell: 46.6
2. HPQ: 41.9
3. HPE: 22.4
4. STX: 24.6

**And now Revenue (billion):** 

1. Dell: 94
2. HPQ: 63.5
3. HPE: 27.8
4. STX: 10.7

&amp;#x200B;

Alright enough with random multiples. This is a long term play for me and not a quick money maker. But if we focus on their revenue, earnings, and then current pricing, they're fairly undervalued. I bought my calls based on where I thought the price could go and I'm fairly confident we'll get there with this company.

77,DELL,"Morning Update for Monday, 1/10/22","Good morning everyone, hope you had a nice and relaxing weekend. 

*These posts are for informational purposes only. I am not a financial advisor.*

**Main Watchlist:**

Gapping UP:

* DELL: Looking to test ATH levels. Potential support level at 59, will watch for more upside if it holds up.
* TSM: Potential resistance level at 126, could provide shorting opportunities if it fails to break over that level. Will watch for upwards movement if it can hold up over 126. Potential support level around \~124. 
* VIAC: Will be watching 36 as potential support level. Potential resistance level around 38. 
* BUD: Potential resistance level at 64. 
* BMRN: Potential support level at 88, will watch for upwards movement towards 90 resistance if it holds up. Could provide shorting opportunities towards 86 support if it fails to hold over 88. 
* UVXY: Potential support levels at 13.25 and 13. Will look to play this if we see more overall weakness, particularly for SPY.

Gapping DOWN:

* LULU: Potential resistance levels at 336 and 340. Will be watching for more weakness if it fails to get over those levels. 
* TSLA: Will be watching the 1,000 level as potential support/resistance this morning.
* TTWO: Potential support/resistance level at 150. Could retrace towards 145 if it fails, room for upside if it can get back over resistance. 
* ABNB: I'll be watching for shorting opportunities if it breaks down below 160 support. 
* NET: Potential support level at 100. 
* AFRM: Potential resistance levels at 78 and 80.
* MARA: Potential resistance at 28. Potential support level around 27-27.50. 
* GME: Potential resistance levels at 136 and 140. Could see more choppiness if it fails to get back over those levels. 

**Momentum Watchlist:**

* RVPH: Appears to have found premarket support at \~3.25. Will watch for more upside if it can hold up. Won't be too interested if it breaks down and cannot recover. 
* DNAY: Will be watching to see if it can get back above the 10.50 level. Won't be too interested in trading it otherwise.
* OCGN: Potential support level at 4.20, potential resistance around 4.50. 
* TLRY: Potential resistance levels at 7, 7.25, and 7.50.

**Market Outlook:**

Stocks are looking to open lower to start the week after we saw some selling off towards the end of last week. We could be in for some more choppiness, as omicron cases saw another surge. Treasury yields also continued to rise, with the 10-year seeing its biggest weekly move since late 2019. We'll see what things look like closer to open, but it could be another day for shorting. 

S&amp;P Futures are down \~60 basis points, Dow Futures are down \~30 basis points, and Nasdaq Futures are down a bit over 1%. Gold and silver are trading slightly lower. Crude oil is down a bit as well, now trading back below the $80 resistance level. Banks are showing continued strength, with several banks pushing through to fresh ATH levels. This could continue given the uncertainty surrounding Fed financial policy at the moment, as an interest rate hike is likely on the horizon. Chinese stocks are mixed in premarket trading after closing last week with relative strength compared to the rest of the market. Airlines and cruise stocks have seen decent strength over the past couple weeks, but are still trading below previous support levels. If they reject those levels over the next few days, they could be in for more weakness. Meme stocks had some pretty intense intraday sell-offs on Friday, still worth keeping an eye on them to start the week though. The crypto market is seeing continued weakness after a relatively uneventful weekend. Bitcoin is currently trading around 40,800. I'll be watching around the 40,000-40,500 level as potential support, but I'm expecting more choppiness. Crypto-related stocks are down in premarket trading as a result. 

Remember to use proper risk management; size appropriately for your account and have a plan for every trade you enter. Happy trading everyone :)",7,12,1641824529.0,2022-01-10T14:22:09+00:00,t3_s0l5nj,StockMarket

DELL has a huge grasp of the enterprise desktop and laptop market as well as a solid footing in data center server hardware, so I think they definitely have room to grow long term. DELL isn't as popular of a tech stock as AAPL or MSFT though, so I'm not sure how much of a runup to really estimate on a LEAPS timeframe.

183,DELL,Corsair Gaming (CRSR): What's it worth? Deep-Dive Analysis,"Growth has underperformed value stocks over the last year due to inflation concerns. This has presented buying opportunities for those who want to add to their boomer portfolios for the long-term. I've decided to analyze companies that are down 50%+ from their 52-week highs.

**Company Overview**

Founded in 1994, Corsair Gaming Inc. (“Corsair” or the “Company”) provides gear for gamers and content creators. The Company designs and sells gaming and streaming peripherals, components and systems globally. Corsair operates through two segments: Gamer and Creator peripherals, and Gaming components and systems. To increase brand loyalty and repeat purchases, the Company has 2 proprietary software platforms: iCUE for Gamers and Elgato for Content Creators.

With many of Corsair’s products maintaining a number one US market share position, its brand, scale and global reach provide significant competitive advantages and allows the company to continue to capture a growing share of the rapidly expanding gaming and streaming market, estimated at over $36.0 billion in 2019.

Corsair leverages its scale and operations to acquire and integrate complementary brands and businesses into its portfolio, completing 6 acquisitions since 2018. Notable acquisitions include Elgato, Origin PC, SCUF Gaming, EpocCam, and Gamer Sensei.

*Historical Revenue, EBITDA, and EBITDA Margins. 2021E - 2025E based on my own assumptions*

Sales growth from 2018 - 2019 was 17.03%, and increased by 55.16% in 2020 due to increased demand, consumer sentiment, and better margins. Over the historical period, gross margins increased from 20.55% to 27.34% and EBITDA margins increased from 6.22% to 11.84%. Net Income and Earnings per share had a significant increase primarily due to strong top-line revenue growth, gross margin expansion in both segments, expanding EBITDA with low capital expenditures, an asset light business model, and investing to consolidate market leadership.

**Q3 2021 Results**

* Corsair gained market share in almost every category through Q3 2021
* Q3 Revenue was impacted by availability of reasonably priced GPUs which curtailed the demand for new PC builds and its components
* Higher logistics costs including ocean and air freight had an impact on Q3 margins resulting in Gross Profit Margin of 25.9%
* Gaming Components and Systems segment was impacted by GPU shortages which caused retail prices to surge to 150%+ of MSRP causing many customers to hold off building a performance gaming PC
* Gamer and Creator Peripherals segment was impacted by IC shortages which caused Corsair’s premium high value products to be in limited supply. Additionally, Gross Profit Margins were impacted by increased logistics costs as well as some reduced sales in premium products
* Company refinanced LT Debt, increased revolver size, and reduced the interest rate to LIBOR + 125.0 bps

**Preliminary Risks**

* Corsair’s competitive position and success in the market depend upon the ability to build and maintain the strength of its brand among gaming enthusiasts
* Long term success and company growth depend heavily on continuous development and improvement of existing and new products
* The Company depends on the introduction and success of third-party high performance computer hardware including GPUs, CPUs, and sophisticated new video games to drive sales of its products
* Industry is highly competitive and Corsair faces intense competition for market share
* Sales depends on the growth of gaming, streaming, and eSports industries

**DCF Valuation**

https://preview.redd.it/hjdj09e3zp881.png?width=740&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0460d39adfc6d85e4a4ccfbcd32417c7836cc9c1

*Base Case DCF Valuation: $28.72 / share*

*Winter's Opinion Case DCF Valuation: $42.58 / share*

Winter's Assumptions: Revenue Growth of 13.0% / 20.0% / 17.5% / 17.5% / 15.0% in projected years, EBITDA Margin 11.0% to 12.5% in projected years, Cost of Equity 10%, Terminal Value EBITDA Exit Multiple 10x (used EBITDA given CapEx estimates), $20.0MM growth capex per year, effective tax rate of 17.4%

* Commentary: Conservative growth estimates based on management expectations and industry growth. Supply chain disruptions should begin to decrease throughout 2022 and its likely GPUs and other systems will have pent-up demand over the next few quarters. The company should see a bullwhip effect in sales growth and a decrease in operating costs moving forward. Increase in stay-at-home lifestyle due to Covid-19 should help sustain sales for years to come.

**Public Comps Analysis**

Competitors: Logitech, Turtle Beach, Dell Technologies, HP Inc.

Based on Multiples (EV/Revenue, EV/EBITDA, Price/Earnings), CRSR share price ranges from $17.40 to $32.30 with an average estimated share price of $23.31

**Outlook and Final Thoughts**

Based on my intrinsic valuation, I believe Corsair is valued at $32.95 (average est. share price of DCF/Comps). Corsair closed at $21.17 on 12.10.2021, representing a 55% discount to my valuation. I think that Corsair is undervalued and selling at a discount. Growth stocks will continue to face problems based on inflation risk until supply chain issues are resolved. The share price may remain volatile in the coming weeks or months. I think this is a good stock to own if you're a strong believer in the gaming industry for the long term and believe that Corsair can continue to capture market share through marketing efforts and quality products.

103,DELL,Would you rather invest in a profitable company with a low valuation or an unprofitable company with a compelling growth story?,"I’ve been thinking about this for a while and wanted to poll this group. What kind of company do you think is a better investment?

At their extremes, the first category would include stocks that look undervalued by multiple different measurements (P/S, Price/Free Cash Flow, etc.) in addition to P/E. They have proven they can be profitable but might be “undervalued” for a good reason. Companies in this category would include MetLife, Dell, Kohl’s, and U.S. Steel. Nobody seems to have strong feelings about these stocks.

The second category would be story stocks including Ark stocks. Companies that strive to be the next big something. They might have compelling fundamentals (rising sales growth, low debt, etc.). But they’re still disliked by many who think unprofitable companies are too speculative. This would include Teledoc, Unity, Beyond Meat, and ChargePoint.

&gt; Fellow automaker Ford also fell, down 2.2% following news that by 2030 Toyota would be investing $35 billion into battery-powered electronic vehicles, a space where Ford has sought to establish itself as a leader. Toyota itself declined even more, with shares off 3.4% premarket.
*****
&gt; Pfizer shares rose nearly 1% after final results of tests on its Covid drug showed it reduced hospitalizations and deaths by 89% in high-risk patients.
*****
&gt; The market will get fresh inflation data Tuesday when November’s producer price index number is reported. Economists are expecting it to show that prices rose 0.5% for the month, according to estimates from Dow Jones. This would be a slight slowdown from October’s 0.6% increase.
*****
&gt; The Federal Reserve also kicks off its two-day meeting on Tuesday. The central bank will release a statement on Wednesday with quarterly projections for the economy, inflation and interest rates. Chairman Jerome Powell will also hold a press conference.
*****
&gt; Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman told CNBC on Monday that he thinks the central bank should start raising rates soon.
*****
&gt; “The Federal Reserve would be better off storing away some of rate increases, so when the inevitable turn down comes, you’ve got some ammunition to fight with,” he said. “At the moment, at zero interest rates, we have no ammunition.”
*****
&gt; Investors will be watching closely for commentary around if the Fed plans to accelerate the end of its bond-buying program. At present, the central bank’s asset purchase program will end in June 2022, but several officials have spoken about ending the purchases sooner.
*****
&gt; “So far the bond market has given the Fed a pass on inflation — whether it will continue to do so is in doubt,” noted Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at All Star Charts. “The real fireworks coming from the meeting are likely to be around expectations for rate hikes in 2022,” he added.
*****
&gt; The latest CNBC Fed Survey showed that investment professionals and economists expect the Fed to wind down its asset purchases by March and begin rate hikes in June.
*****
&gt; During trading Monday, the Dow slid 0.89%, or 320 points, while the S&amp;P 500 dipped 0.9%. The Nasdaq Composite fell 1.39% as investors rotated out of technology stocks with high valuations.
*****
&gt; Shares of airlines and cruise line operators declined amid fears that the omicron variant could slow travel.
*****
&gt; While equities fell broadly on Monday, growth areas of the market underperformed. The iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF dipped 1.22%, while the iShares Russell 1,000 Value ETF declined 0.45%.
*****
&gt; Despite Monday’s decline for equities, the S&amp;P 500 is roughly 1.6% below its Nov. 22 all-time intraday high. The Dow is 2.5% below its record, while the Nasdaq Composite is about 5% under its high-water mark. The Russell 2000 index is down a sharper 11.3% since its Nov. 8 high.
*****
&gt; Looking forward, some strategists, including LPL Financial’s Ryan Detrick, believe there’s upside ahead for equities.
*****
&gt; “We believe pent-up demand, gradual improvement in supply chain challenges, solid labor force growth, and productivity gains will all contribute to another year of above-trend economic growth in 2022,” he wrote in a note to clients. “COVID-19-related risks remain and the potential for a policy mistake may be elevated as the economy moves towards normalization, but we think the overall environment will be supportive of business growth and ultimately equity markets,” he added.

# [Stock futures slip lower ahead of key inflation data, Fed meeting](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/13/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock index futures were marginally lower during morning trading Tuesday after the major averages started the week in the red as Covid omicron fears hit sentiment.
*****
&gt; Futures contracts tied to the S&amp;P 500 futures declined 0.13% while and Nasdaq 100 futures were off by nearly 0.5%. Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average bounced between gains and losses.
*****
&gt; Tesla shares were among the biggest early droppers on the S&amp;P 500, falling 2.3% premarket after CEO Elon Musk announced that that he has sold another $906.5 million in shares.
*****
&gt; Fellow automaker Ford also fell, down 2.2% following news that by 2030 Toyota would be investing $35 billion into battery-powered electronic vehicles, a space where Ford has sought to establish itself as a leader. Toyota itself declined even more, with shares off 3.4% premarket.
*****
&gt; Pfizer shares rose nearly 1% after final results of tests on its Covid drug showed it reduced hospitalizations and deaths by 89% in high-risk patients.
*****
&gt; The market will get fresh inflation data Tuesday when November’s producer price index number is reported. Economists are expecting it to show that prices rose 0.5% for the month, according to estimates from Dow Jones. This would be a slight slowdown from October’s 0.6% increase.
*****
&gt; The Federal Reserve also kicks off its two-day meeting on Tuesday. The central bank will release a statement on Wednesday with quarterly projections for the economy, inflation and interest rates. Chairman Jerome Powell will also hold a press conference.
*****
&gt; Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman told CNBC on Monday that he thinks the central bank should start raising rates soon.
*****
&gt; “The Federal Reserve would be better off storing away some of rate increases, so when the inevitable turn down comes, you’ve got some ammunition to fight with,” he said. “At the moment, at zero interest rates, we have no ammunition.”
*****
&gt; Investors will be watching closely for commentary around if the Fed plans to accelerate the end of its bond-buying program. At present, the central bank’s asset purchase program will end in June 2022, but several officials have spoken about ending the purchases sooner.
*****
&gt; “So far the bond market has given the Fed a pass on inflation — whether it will continue to do so is in doubt,” noted Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at All Star Charts. “The real fireworks coming from the meeting are likely to be around expectations for rate hikes in 2022,” he added.
*****
&gt; The latest CNBC Fed Survey showed that investment professionals and economists expect the Fed to wind down its asset purchases by March and begin rate hikes in June.
*****
&gt; During trading Monday, the Dow slid 0.89%, or 320 points, while the S&amp;P 500 dipped 0.9%. The Nasdaq Composite fell 1.39% as investors rotated out of technology stocks with high valuations.
*****
&gt; Shares of airlines and cruise line operators declined amid fears that the omicron variant could slow travel.
*****
&gt; While equities fell broadly on Monday, growth areas of the market underperformed. The iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF dipped 1.22%, while the iShares Russell 1,000 Value ETF declined 0.45%.
*****
&gt; Despite Monday’s decline for equities, the S&amp;P 500 is roughly 1.6% below its Nov. 22 all-time intraday high. The Dow is 2.5% below its record, while the Nasdaq Composite is about 5% under its high-water mark. The Russell 2000 index is down a sharper 11.3% since its Nov. 8 high.
*****
&gt; Looking forward, some strategists, including LPL Financial’s Ryan Detrick, believe there’s upside ahead for equities.
*****
&gt; “We believe pent-up demand, gradual improvement in supply chain challenges, solid labor force growth, and productivity gains will all contribute to another year of above-trend economic growth in 2022,” he wrote in a note to clients. “COVID-19-related risks remain and the potential for a policy mistake may be elevated as the economy moves towards normalization, but we think the overall environment will be supportive of business growth and ultimately equity markets,” he added.

27,DELL,Corsair Gaming (CRSR): Intrinsic Valuation Analysis,"Growth has underperformed value stocks over the last year due to inflation concerns. This has presented buying opportunities for those who want to add to their boomer portfolios for the long-term. I've decided to analyze companies that are down 50%+ from their 52-week highs.

**Company Overview**

Founded in 1994, Corsair Gaming Inc. (“Corsair” or the “Company”) provides gear for gamers and content creators. The Company designs and sells gaming and streaming peripherals, components and systems globally. Corsair operates through two segments: Gamer and Creator peripherals, and Gaming components and systems. To increase brand loyalty and repeat purchases, the Company has 2 proprietary software platforms: iCUE for Gamers and Elgato for Content Creators.

With many of Corsair’s products maintaining a number one US market share position, its brand, scale and global reach provide significant competitive advantages and allows the company to continue to capture a growing share of the rapidly expanding gaming and streaming market, estimated at over $36.0 billion in 2019.

Corsair leverages its scale and operations to acquire and integrate complementary brands and businesses into its portfolio, completing 6 acquisitions since 2018. Notable acquisitions include Elgato, Origin PC, SCUF Gaming, EpocCam, and Gamer Sensei.

**Financial Snapshot &amp; Commentary**

[https://imgur.com/a/tFAjRJs](https://imgur.com/a/tFAjRJs)

[https://imgur.com/a/FsjHNIQ](https://imgur.com/a/FsjHNIQ)

*Historical Revenue, EBITDA, and EBITDA Margins. 2021E - 2025E based on my own assumptions*

Sales growth from 2018 - 2019 was 17.03%, and increased by 55.16% in 2020 due to increased demand, consumer sentiment, and better margins. Over the historical period, gross margins increased from 20.55% to 27.34% and EBITDA margins increased from 6.22% to 11.84%. Net Income and Earnings per share had a significant increase primarily due to strong top-line revenue growth, gross margin expansion in both segments, expanding EBITDA with low capital expenditures, an asset light business model, and investing to consolidate market leadership.

**Q3 2021 Results**

* Corsair gained market share in almost every category through Q3 2021
* Q3 Revenue was impacted by availability of reasonably priced GPUs which curtailed the demand for new PC builds and its components
* Higher logistics costs including ocean and air freight had an impact on Q3 margins resulting in Gross Profit Margin of 25.9%
* Gaming Components and Systems segment was impacted by GPU shortages which caused retail prices to surge to 150%+ of MSRP causing many customers to hold off building a performance gaming PC
* Gamer and Creator Peripherals segment was impacted by IC shortages which caused Corsair’s premium high value products to be in limited supply. Additionally, Gross Profit Margins were impacted by increased logistics costs as well as some reduced sales in premium products
* Company refinanced LT Debt, increased revolver size, and reduced the interest rate to LIBOR + 125.0 bps

**Preliminary Risks**

* Corsair’s competitive position and success in the market depend upon the ability to build and maintain the strength of its brand among gaming enthusiasts
* Long term success and company growth depend heavily on continuous development and improvement of existing and new products
* The Company depends on the introduction and success of third-party high performance computer hardware including GPUs, CPUs, and sophisticated new video games to drive sales of its products
* Industry is highly competitive and Corsair faces intense competition for market share
* Sales depends on the growth of gaming, streaming, and eSports industries

**DCF Valuation**

[https://imgur.com/a/ZzXmFOh](https://imgur.com/a/ZzXmFOh)

*Base Case DCF Valuation: $28.72 / share*

*Winter's Opinion Case DCF Valuation: $42.58 / share*

Winter's Assumptions: Revenue Growth of 13.0% / 20.0% / 17.5% / 17.5% / 15.0% in projected years, EBITDA Margin 11.0% to 12.5% in projected years, Cost of Equity 10%, Terminal Value EBITDA Exit Multiple 10x (used EBITDA given CapEx estimates), $20.0MM growth capex per year, effective tax rate of 17.4%

* Commentary: Conservative growth estimates based on management expectations and industry growth. Supply chain disruptions should begin to decrease throughout 2022 and its likely GPUs and other systems will have pent-up demand over the next few quarters. The company should see a bullwhip effect in sales growth and a decrease in operating costs moving forward. Increase in stay-at-home lifestyle due to Covid-19 should help sustain sales for years to come.

**Public Comps Analysis**

Competitors: Logitech, Turtle Beach, Dell Technologies, HP Inc.

Based on Multiples (EV/Revenue, EV/EBITDA, Price/Earnings), CRSR share price ranges from $17.40 to $32.30 with an average estimated share price of $23.31

**Outlook and Final Thoughts**

Based on my intrinsic valuation, I believe Corsair is valued at $32.95 (average est. share price of DCF/Comps). Corsair closed at $21.17 on 12.10.2021, representing a 55% discount to my valuation. I think that Corsair is undervalued and selling at a discount. Growth stocks will continue to face problems based on inflation risk until supply chain issues are resolved. The share price may remain volatile in the coming weeks or months. I think this is a good stock to own if you're a strong believer in the gaming industry for the long term and believe that Corsair can continue to capture market share through marketing efforts and quality products.

184,DELL,IONQ,"Real DD from the first 2 days of the Q2B conference in Santa Clara, summarized by me:

Head of Air Force Research Labs quantum tech says US, UK, Canada, NZ, and Australia are collaborating on quantum applications for unaided navigation, encryption, communication and sensors/ML. A joint field test will be conducted this summer. The small size of IONQ's processors and lack of need for cooling (done by lasers), they believe, will allow them to be mounted inside aircraft. Some testing of this is underway already. AF believes trapped ions are the superior QC method and there is ""much more to come.""

Dell collaboration is moving past the test phase, but specifics were kept under lock and key.

MIT's Center For Quantum Computing believes there will be many winners, depending on the usage needs for each system, but IONQ's small form (ie the QPU can be held in the palm of your hand vs you being able to walk inside it) and the ability to operate at room temperature continue to be significant practical advantages for scaling. IONQ has confirmed they are on track for a rack mounted system. 

Using trapped Barium-133 ions appears superior to Ytterbium. It is rumored that is what IONQ has now been using. 

Mark Solomon, who worked in quantum computing sales at IBM before joining IONQ, said unequivocally when asked that he ""left [IBM] because IONQ's tech was far superior on every front."" 

Confirmed QCWare did derivative calculations for Goldman Sachs on IONQ systems. 

Staff plans to have 200 employees by the end of 2022. It currently stands at 100, up from 60 last year. 



Here is a synopsis of day 2 of Q2B. Despite the stock price, it was a VERY significant one for IONQ. Once again, I do not take credit for the information provided here, just compiling it and few thoughts of my own. The credit goes to those on the ground reporting it live.

The QC industry stands at $490 million, but is growing 3x faster than the classical computing industry. It appears most in the industry agree the point of critical inflection is 2-3 years away. This is in line with my personal research into the industry and is important because a year ago the most optimistic estimates had it 5, 10, or even 20 years away. There is zero doubt at this time that IONQ leads the pack. Everyone else is trying (and might) catch up.

The Air Force presentation yesterday foreshadowed todays announcement using Barium-133 in the next generation of QCs. This allows for 99.98% gate fidelity BEFORE error correction. That alone should blow your mind if you understand this stuff. If not, they are also able to use cheap and easily sourced visual lasers to control individual atoms through SOFTWARE. This speaks to the new level of precision. In addition to this, they are working on 3 more generations of QCs. That is to say the Barium computer is not a plan or theoretical - it's being used. There are 3 additional ones already being worked on. When the 3rd generation comes out, it is nearly impossible to believe they won't have 70+ algorithmic qubits, which is generally held as the standard for true quantum supremacy.

The Barium laser software controlled QC is likely why not only Dell chose to work with IONQ, but also the US, UK, NZ, Canada, and Australian militaries.

In private, both Peter Chapman and Mark Solomon agreed that this will be the technology that is able to scale up, be modular, and overtake classical computing forever on complex calculations. 

2-3 years, possibly sooner, we will be headed towards the dawn of a fundamentally new era not only in the company, but human history. The stock price will eventually catch up, but this is difficult stuff for experts, let alone Main Street, to grasp. It will happen though, and much sooner than people used to think.",76,73,1639009326.0,2021-12-09T00:22:06+00:00,t3_rc4z1j,wallstreetbets

186,DELL,Dell DD (earnings tomorrow),"TL/DR

PC’s from 2012-2018 will replaced en mass over the next 2 years because of TPM requirements for Windows 11. Old servers 2012- 2018 will be replaced because new technologies make these investments worthwhile (ddr5, pcie 4 &amp; 5, gpu acceleration, machine learning, and much higher performance and lower power server CPUs.)

&amp;#x200B;

I expect we’ll see bump from a Windows 11 push. 11 is still very new and doesn’t even show up on the w3 OS platform statistics yet. 1. Many 11 sales will be organic, (people just wanting a new faster computer), but many will be forced because their computer doesn’t meet system requirements.

Dell’s has always had a consistent server share. Frankly though, prior to 2018, there really weren’t too many huge performance benefits for a company to upgrade their servers.

It took a while, but there is now a lot of hardware that can utilize PCIe4. Also, PCIe5 is now being rolled out but will be hitting servers and consumer PC’s in 2022.

DDR5 is in high demand, short supply, but supply should start catching up in 2022.

**Regarding separation from VMWare and most recent Earnings.**

Take this section with more than a grain of salt. I’m not the greatest at maths and not an expert on “sspinoffs”.

^(“Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE: DELL) stockholders will receive .440626 of a share of Vmware, Inc Common stock, Class A (NYSE: VMW) for each share of Dell held as of October 29.)

^(Dell will shed its 81% stake in VMware, creating an independent software company with a stock market value of $64 billion, Financial Times reports.“)

Dell went from 85B to 42B  (IMO an overreaction)

VMW is currently worth 50B.

&amp;#x200B;

**Extractions from FY22’ earnings:**

^(“VMware revenue was $3.1 billion for the second quarter, up 8% driven by broad-based strength across a diverse product portfolio. Operating income for the quarter was $849 million, or 27.0% of VMware revenue.)

^(Infrastructure Solutions Group revenue for the second quarter was $8.4 billion, up 3% as customers accelerate their IT investments with focus on multi-cloud solutions. Servers and networking revenue was $4.5 billion, up 6%, and storage revenue was $4.0 billion, down 1%. Operating income was $970 million for the second quarter, or approximately 11.5% of Infrastructure Solutions Group revenue.)

^(Client Solutions Group revenue for the second quarter was up 27% to a record $14.3 billion. Operating income was a second quarter record $995 million, up 39%, and 7% of Client Solutions Group revenue, as the company innovates across the ecosystem to deliver an enhanced experience for customers looking to work and play effectively from anywhere. Commercial client revenue was $10.6 billion, up 32%, and consumer revenue was a second quarter record of $3.7 billion, up 17%.“)

VMWare accounted for 30% operating income (849 / 2814)

VMWare accounted for 12% revenue. (3.1 / 25.8)

VMW was a considerable source of income and revenue, but I don’t think warrants the price of VMW now, or the hit that it caused Dell. I think Dell investors were scared, but this earnings will put fears at ease.

46,DELL,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning November 22nd, 2021","Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 22nd, 2021.

# **Stocks may be entering an optimal period in the Thanksgiving holiday week - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/19/stocks-may-be-entering-an-optimal-period-in-the-thanksgiving-holiday-week.html)**
*****
&gt; If history is a guide, the market should do well in the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday week.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was slightly higher in the past week, buoyed by positive economic reports, particularly the unexpectedly strong 1.7% jump in October’s retail sales. There are a number of economic reports in the week ahead. The most important release is Wednesday’s personal consumption expenditures, which includes the inflation measure most watched by the Federal Reserve.
*****
&gt; “The last five trading days of November are traditionally positive, since 1950,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. “There’s a two-thirds likelihood the market is up on the day before Thanksgiving and a 57% likelihood the day after Thanksgiving, and a 71% likelihood that it’s up on Monday.”
*****
&gt; This year that holiday rally could depend on whether Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell continues in his role after his term expires in February. Biden has also interviewed Fed Governor Lael Brainard, who is supported by progressive Democrats.
*****
&gt; Strategists expect market volatility around the appointment, particularly if it is Brainard. She is viewed as more dovish than Powell, meaning she may be slower to raise interest rates. Elevated levels of inflation have been a concern in the market, and the worry is Brainard would not be as aggressive fighting it with rate hikes if necessary.
*****
&gt; “Barring a change at the helm of the Fed, I think the market trajectory is going to continue to be higher, as we move toward 2022,” said Jeff Schulze, investment strategist with ClearBridge Investments. “Given that Brainard is even more dovish than Powell, I think markets would recover very quickly... the markets are unsure whether the new Fed chairman could command consensus within the FOMC to effectively deliver policy,” he added.
*****
&gt; Schulze said the economic momentum is improving, and he expects that fourth-quarter gross domestic product could be in the double digits after the disappointing 2% pace of the third quarter. The second reading for the third-quarter GDP is released Wednesday.
*****
&gt; In the past week, the Philadelphia Fed manufacturing index also showed solid, better-than-expected activity in the mid-Atlantic region. “It really confirms the view that despite supply side constraints, the recovery is on track after the Covid-related slowdown in Q3,” Schulze said. “I think the markets are going to price in better earnings as we move into fourth-quarter earnings and 2022.”
*****
&gt; But Stovall said the market may take a pause before it moves higher, and he expects a choppy period. The S&amp;P 500 gains on average 7.2% between its October low and the end of the year. But by early November, the S&amp;P 500 was up more than 9% from its low, and was overbought, he said.
*****
&gt; Stovall also said the market could become concerned again about the spread of Covid in Europe and beyond. Due to a high rate of new cases, the government of Austria announced a three-week lockdown and a vaccine mandate.
*****
&gt; Stocks reacted negatively to the Austrian news Friday, though the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained. Stocks were mixed for the week, with the Dow down 1.4% and the Nasdaq up 1.2%, lifted by tech stock gains. The S&amp;P 500 was up 0.3% for the week, ending at 4,697.
*****
&gt; “There is still upside potential. The worry about inflation and now Covid are reasons for the overbought condition to work itself through,” he said. Stovall added the market could move sideways to lower for awhile, but it should end the year higher. “But right now, there’s a bit of choppiness because of Covid, because of the Fed chair possibly being replaced the worry about inflation and now and a whole variety of things,” he said.
*****
&gt; For investors who watch the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, Wells Fargo bond strategists point out that long-term Treasury yields generally move lower on the Monday and Tuesday before Thanksgiving.
*****
&gt; “Our take is straightforward, and is essentially the same rationale as for moves around Labor Day: risk appetite is low on both the buy and sell sides,” they said. But later in the week, starting Wednesday, the yield tends to rise.

&gt; # Tech is Leading Again

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Information Technology Sector has gained 27% in the past six months, outperforming the broader S&amp;P 500 by more than 10%. But could its run of leadership just be getting started? As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the sector just broke out to fresh relative highs for the first time since September 2020.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Chart-11.18.21.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; 14 months without a new relative high may not sound like a lot, but that actually represented the longest streak of underperformance for the tech sector since a more than 3-year run that ended in 2015. And while the sector’s breakout does not mean that it will automatically go on another run of multiyear outperformance, we do believe context is important and that investors should recognize that just because technology has had a strong run recently, over the past 14 months the sector has performed just in line with the broader market. We would also note that these are not all-time relative highs for the sector, as it still sits below its early-2000 peak.

&gt; “The theme of 2021 has been rotation, rotation, rotation,” said LPL Financial Technical Strategist Scott Brown. “But technology is the only sector to recently hit a 52-week relative high and we believe that sets up a favorable outlook heading into 2022.”

&gt; From a fundamental perspective, technology continues to be a key enabler of higher productivity and home to many of the fastest growing companies. Despite topping all sectors with 9% earnings growth in 2020, earnings growth this year is on track to exceed 30%.

&gt; So does this mean investors should be shifting all of their assets over to growth stocks again? We don’t necessarily think so, and continue to find opportunities in both growth and value styles. In our proprietary sector trend rankings, technology comes in at #2, trailing only energy and just ahead of financials, both of which sit firmly in the value style and have benefitted from the continued reopening and above trend economic growth. We believe quality growth and more cyclical value companies can both do well in the current environment and remain most negative on defensive sectors such as consumer staples and utilities that have traditionally underperformed during early-to-middle stages of the business cycle.

&gt; # Sentiment Back to Average

&gt; The past week has seen the S&amp;P 500 hover right below but not at record highs. The lack of new highs in price appears to have left individual investors apprehensive as bullish sentiment in the AAII survey pulled back 9.2 percentage points to 38.8%. That was the biggest one-week drop since a 16.5 percentage point decline in the week of September 16th, though back then, bullish sentiment sat much lower at 22.4%. At the current level, bullish sentiment is still within one percentage point of the historical average.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111821-AAII-Bull.png))**



&gt; While bullish sentiment saw a sharp reversal lower, bearish sentiment rose modestly to 27.2%. That is the highest level since the end of October and that remains roughly 3 percentage points below the historical average.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111821-AAII-Bear.png))**

&gt; Those inverse moves resulted in the bull-bear spread falling to 11.6. While lower, that still indicates overall sentiment favors optimists.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111821-AAII-Spread.png))**

&gt; A greater share of the losses to bullish sentiment shifted to the neutral camp with around a third of respondents reporting as such. That is the highest level since the first week of October. That reading is a few percentage points above the historical average meaning that like bullish and bearish sentiment, current survey readings do not indicate sentiment is elevated or depressed to any sort of notable extent.

&gt; # 2021 Now Has The Second Most New Highs Ever

&gt; The incredible bull run of 2021 continues, with the S&amp;P 500 Index only 0.02% away from the 66th all-time high this calendar year, tied with (for now) the 65 set in 1964 and behind only the record 77 set in 1995. “We’ve run out of superlatives to describe what we’ve seen so far this year, so we’ll keep it very simple. Years like this don’t happen very often, so let’s remember to enjoy it,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, 66 new highs this year would be second only to 1995. With about six weeks to go this year, 2021 is on pace to just barely miss setting a new record of new highs, but they say you won’t hit the pitches you don’t swing at and 2021 still has a lot of swings left, so anything is possible.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/11.17.21-Blog-Chart1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; As we noted at the start of the month, November has been the best month of the year for stocks and it has been quite strong yet again this year. But be aware that November is historically rather strong early and late, while the middle can be choppy. Suggesting new highs could be a little tough to come by in the near-term, at least until we all get our fill of Turkey next week.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/11.17.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Additionally, post-election years can get quite choppy from now until late in December. After the run we’ve had lately, maybe some sideways chop is necessary, but we see further gains ahead through year-end.

&gt; # Small and Mid Caps Gain Ground

&gt; Equities broadly have been in rally mode so far this quarter, but in the month of November smaller market caps have generally outperformed. Month to date, the small-cap S&amp;P 600 ETF (IJR) has gained 5.88% as of this morning while the mid-cap S&amp;P 400 ETF (IJH) has risen 4.21%. Large caps as proxied by the S&amp;P 500 (SPY), meanwhile, are up less than 2% MTD. While there is plenty of time left in the month for things to change, the spread between the month-to-date performance of small and mid-caps versus large caps is on pace to be on the wider side of all months of the past twenty years. As shown in the charts below, IJR is currently outperforming SPY MTD by 4.05 percentage points, and that reading is 2.37 percentage points for IJH versus SPY. Those rank in the 91st and 86th percentiles, respectively, of all months of the past twenty years. That also marks the first month with significant outperformance of smaller market caps relative to large caps since the stretch of large-cap underperformance that ran from the fall of last year through this past February. Prior to that, you would have to go back to March 2018 to find the last time that small and mid-caps both outperformed large caps by as much as they are this month.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 22nd, 2021.

# **Stocks may be entering an optimal period in the Thanksgiving holiday week - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/19/stocks-may-be-entering-an-optimal-period-in-the-thanksgiving-holiday-week.html)**
*****
&gt; If history is a guide, the market should do well in the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday week.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was slightly higher in the past week, buoyed by positive economic reports, particularly the unexpectedly strong 1.7% jump in October’s retail sales. There are a number of economic reports in the week ahead. The most important release is Wednesday’s personal consumption expenditures, which includes the inflation measure most watched by the Federal Reserve.
*****
&gt; “The last five trading days of November are traditionally positive, since 1950,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. “There’s a two-thirds likelihood the market is up on the day before Thanksgiving and a 57% likelihood the day after Thanksgiving, and a 71% likelihood that it’s up on Monday.”
*****
&gt; This year that holiday rally could depend on whether Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell continues in his role after his term expires in February. Biden has also interviewed Fed Governor Lael Brainard, who is supported by progressive Democrats.
*****
&gt; Strategists expect market volatility around the appointment, particularly if it is Brainard. She is viewed as more dovish than Powell, meaning she may be slower to raise interest rates. Elevated levels of inflation have been a concern in the market, and the worry is Brainard would not be as aggressive fighting it with rate hikes if necessary.
*****
&gt; “Barring a change at the helm of the Fed, I think the market trajectory is going to continue to be higher, as we move toward 2022,” said Jeff Schulze, investment strategist with ClearBridge Investments. “Given that Brainard is even more dovish than Powell, I think markets would recover very quickly... the markets are unsure whether the new Fed chairman could command consensus within the FOMC to effectively deliver policy,” he added.
*****
&gt; Schulze said the economic momentum is improving, and he expects that fourth-quarter gross domestic product could be in the double digits after the disappointing 2% pace of the third quarter. The second reading for the third-quarter GDP is released Wednesday.
*****
&gt; In the past week, the Philadelphia Fed manufacturing index also showed solid, better-than-expected activity in the mid-Atlantic region. “It really confirms the view that despite supply side constraints, the recovery is on track after the Covid-related slowdown in Q3,” Schulze said. “I think the markets are going to price in better earnings as we move into fourth-quarter earnings and 2022.”
*****
&gt; But Stovall said the market may take a pause before it moves higher, and he expects a choppy period. The S&amp;P 500 gains on average 7.2% between its October low and the end of the year. But by early November, the S&amp;P 500 was up more than 9% from its low, and was overbought, he said.
*****
&gt; Stovall also said the market could become concerned again about the spread of Covid in Europe and beyond. Due to a high rate of new cases, the government of Austria announced a three-week lockdown and a vaccine mandate.
*****
&gt; Stocks reacted negatively to the Austrian news Friday, though the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained. Stocks were mixed for the week, with the Dow down 1.4% and the Nasdaq up 1.2%, lifted by tech stock gains. The S&amp;P 500 was up 0.3% for the week, ending at 4,697.
*****
&gt; “There is still upside potential. The worry about inflation and now Covid are reasons for the overbought condition to work itself through,” he said. Stovall added the market could move sideways to lower for awhile, but it should end the year higher. “But right now, there’s a bit of choppiness because of Covid, because of the Fed chair possibly being replaced the worry about inflation and now and a whole variety of things,” he said.
*****
&gt; For investors who watch the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, Wells Fargo bond strategists point out that long-term Treasury yields generally move lower on the Monday and Tuesday before Thanksgiving.
*****
&gt; “Our take is straightforward, and is essentially the same rationale as for moves around Labor Day: risk appetite is low on both the buy and sell sides,” they said. But later in the week, starting Wednesday, the yield tends to rise.

&gt; # Tech is Leading Again

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Information Technology Sector has gained 27% in the past six months, outperforming the broader S&amp;P 500 by more than 10%. But could its run of leadership just be getting started? As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the sector just broke out to fresh relative highs for the first time since September 2020.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Chart-11.18.21.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; 14 months without a new relative high may not sound like a lot, but that actually represented the longest streak of underperformance for the tech sector since a more than 3-year run that ended in 2015. And while the sector’s breakout does not mean that it will automatically go on another run of multiyear outperformance, we do believe context is important and that investors should recognize that just because technology has had a strong run recently, over the past 14 months the sector has performed just in line with the broader market. We would also note that these are not all-time relative highs for the sector, as it still sits below its early-2000 peak.

&gt; “The theme of 2021 has been rotation, rotation, rotation,” said LPL Financial Technical Strategist Scott Brown. “But technology is the only sector to recently hit a 52-week relative high and we believe that sets up a favorable outlook heading into 2022.”

&gt; From a fundamental perspective, technology continues to be a key enabler of higher productivity and home to many of the fastest growing companies. Despite topping all sectors with 9% earnings growth in 2020, earnings growth this year is on track to exceed 30%.

&gt; So does this mean investors should be shifting all of their assets over to growth stocks again? We don’t necessarily think so, and continue to find opportunities in both growth and value styles. In our proprietary sector trend rankings, technology comes in at #2, trailing only energy and just ahead of financials, both of which sit firmly in the value style and have benefitted from the continued reopening and above trend economic growth. We believe quality growth and more cyclical value companies can both do well in the current environment and remain most negative on defensive sectors such as consumer staples and utilities that have traditionally underperformed during early-to-middle stages of the business cycle.

&gt; # Sentiment Back to Average

&gt; The past week has seen the S&amp;P 500 hover right below but not at record highs. The lack of new highs in price appears to have left individual investors apprehensive as bullish sentiment in the AAII survey pulled back 9.2 percentage points to 38.8%. That was the biggest one-week drop since a 16.5 percentage point decline in the week of September 16th, though back then, bullish sentiment sat much lower at 22.4%. At the current level, bullish sentiment is still within one percentage point of the historical average.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111821-AAII-Bull.png))**



&gt; While bullish sentiment saw a sharp reversal lower, bearish sentiment rose modestly to 27.2%. That is the highest level since the end of October and that remains roughly 3 percentage points below the historical average.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111821-AAII-Bear.png))**

&gt; Those inverse moves resulted in the bull-bear spread falling to 11.6. While lower, that still indicates overall sentiment favors optimists.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111821-AAII-Spread.png))**

&gt; A greater share of the losses to bullish sentiment shifted to the neutral camp with around a third of respondents reporting as such. That is the highest level since the first week of October. That reading is a few percentage points above the historical average meaning that like bullish and bearish sentiment, current survey readings do not indicate sentiment is elevated or depressed to any sort of notable extent.

&gt; # 2021 Now Has The Second Most New Highs Ever

&gt; The incredible bull run of 2021 continues, with the S&amp;P 500 Index only 0.02% away from the 66th all-time high this calendar year, tied with (for now) the 65 set in 1964 and behind only the record 77 set in 1995. “We’ve run out of superlatives to describe what we’ve seen so far this year, so we’ll keep it very simple. Years like this don’t happen very often, so let’s remember to enjoy it,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, 66 new highs this year would be second only to 1995. With about six weeks to go this year, 2021 is on pace to just barely miss setting a new record of new highs, but they say you won’t hit the pitches you don’t swing at and 2021 still has a lot of swings left, so anything is possible.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/11.17.21-Blog-Chart1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; As we noted at the start of the month, November has been the best month of the year for stocks and it has been quite strong yet again this year. But be aware that November is historically rather strong early and late, while the middle can be choppy. Suggesting new highs could be a little tough to come by in the near-term, at least until we all get our fill of Turkey next week.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/11.17.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Additionally, post-election years can get quite choppy from now until late in December. After the run we’ve had lately, maybe some sideways chop is necessary, but we see further gains ahead through year-end.

&gt; # Small and Mid Caps Gain Ground

&gt; Equities broadly have been in rally mode so far this quarter, but in the month of November smaller market caps have generally outperformed. Month to date, the small-cap S&amp;P 600 ETF (IJR) has gained 5.88% as of this morning while the mid-cap S&amp;P 400 ETF (IJH) has risen 4.21%. Large caps as proxied by the S&amp;P 500 (SPY), meanwhile, are up less than 2% MTD. While there is plenty of time left in the month for things to change, the spread between the month-to-date performance of small and mid-caps versus large caps is on pace to be on the wider side of all months of the past twenty years. As shown in the charts below, IJR is currently outperforming SPY MTD by 4.05 percentage points, and that reading is 2.37 percentage points for IJH versus SPY. Those rank in the 91st and 86th percentiles, respectively, of all months of the past twenty years. That also marks the first month with significant outperformance of smaller market caps relative to large caps since the stretch of large-cap underperformance that ran from the fall of last year through this past February. Prior to that, you would have to go back to March 2018 to find the last time that small and mid-caps both outperformed large caps by as much as they are this month.

So far the shortage has cost 2.2 Million vehicles. That could just be a tiny fraction if Taiwan has more serious future issues such as natural disasters or China invasion, which could cost businesses TRILLIONS in damages to companies such as:  Ford (F) , General Motors (GM) , and Toyota (TM), Dell Technologies (DELL),  Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOGL), AMD, NVDA, and many more.


&gt;The group, which also includes the governors of auto-producing states like Alabama, said the shortage had cost automakers 2.2 million vehicles and affected 575,000 jobs in the industry.

&gt;The semiconductor funding passed the U.S. Senate earlier this year by 68-32 as part of the broader U.S. Innovation and Competition Act, or USICA. But it has not passed the House of Representatives.

​​4 ways to reduce water consumption in semiconductor manufacturing:

* Transition from wet to dry etching
* Improvements on the efficiency of etching processes used for ultrapure water (UPW) production
* Optimization of tools and procedures for UPW production process
* Reuse of spent rinse waters/wastewater streams

**Technical Analysis**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9brk0w620oo71.png?width=2668&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e9e48b60a203a512e916039a142c8f77362a176

Looking at the 6-month chart for TSM, strong resistance and support lines indicate a resistance around the $125 mark and solid support around the $108 mark. A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108.

**Conclusion**

The biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates. Large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank, are only scratching the surface. TSM’s Green Marketing Strategy does little to address the issue at hand. The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn’t pay out high dividends (\~1.56% annually) but does re-invest that money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden’s $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies. TSM has a positive outlook for the next 3-4 years.

​​4 ways to reduce water consumption in semiconductor manufacturing:

* Transition from wet to dry etching
* Improvements on the efficiency of etching processes used for ultrapure water (UPW) production
* Optimization of tools and procedures for UPW production process
* Reuse of spent rinse waters/wastewater streams

**Technical Analysis**

Looking at the 6-month chart for TSM, strong resistance and support lines indicate a resistance around the $125 mark and solid support around the $108 mark. A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108.

**Conclusion**

The biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates. Large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank, are only scratching the surface. TSM’s Green Marketing Strategy does little to address the issue at hand. The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn’t pay out dividends but instead uses the money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden’s $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies. TSM has a positive outlook for the next 3-4 years.

The recent chip shortage has shown that the U.S can't keep up with semiconductor demand. Joe Biden has laid out a $50B subsidy plan for research and development in the semiconductor industry. In the CEO Summit on Semiconductor Supply Chain Resilience, Biden stated that this was a “once in a generation” investment for the future. Semiconductor chips are as essential to our everyday lives as water.

*This list is geared towards day trading. With the momentum watchlist especially, I am typically in and out very quickly, only occasionally longer than a couple minutes, usually faster scalps.* Always have a plan when you enter a trade (for profit taking and for taking a loss), and use proper risk management for your account.

Gapping DOWN:

**Market Outlook:**

Stocks are looking to open higher after another choppy trading session on Friday. Fears over regulatory scrutiny in China continue, as the Financial Times reported that Beijing was looking to break up financial tech company Alipay. BABA and other Chinese stocks are trading lower in premarket, as a result. We should be getting more inflation numbers in this week, and this will be important to monitor, as it could affect how/when the Fed steps in. The August consumer price index (CPI) should be reported on Tuesday. We have been seeing some supply chain issues around the world, and this will likely apply upwards pressure on inflation numbers, at least in the short-term. Retail sales are expected to drop once again, we'll see if they're in line with analyst estimates. I think we could see some more volatility in the coming days.

DIA is trading a bit under 349. 348 will be a support level to watch, but we could hold up after a bounce off the SMA(100) in Friday's trading. I'll be watching price action around that level. QQQ is trading a bit over 378 and is hovering between support and resistance. If we continue to see weakness, it could test 375 as support. If it sees strength, it could test 380 as resistance.

I was suprised on some companies not being added to SP500 such as dell or zoom.  To be included in the SP500 stocks need to be worth at least 10 billion and need to be profitable U.S companies. SP400 is 2-10 billion and SP600 are 300 million to 2 billion.

84,DELL,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning August 23rd, 2021","Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 23rd, 2021.

# **Fed officials will seek to avoid a tantrum as they keep ‘taper talk’ going at Jackson Hole - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/20/fed-officials-will-seek-to-avoid-a-tantrum-as-they-keep-taper-talk-going-at-jackson-hole.html)**
*****
&gt; The Federal Reserve’s efforts to reverse its easy policy will be a dominant theme for markets in the week ahead, as central bankers gather in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
*****
&gt; The central bankers may even look relaxed against the backdrop of the Grand Tetons in the crisp late August air. But they will be under pressure to gently steer toward less policy support, without creating a market tantrum.
*****
&gt; Federal Reserve officials, in numerous recent speeches and interviews, have already managed to speed up expectations for when they could begin to slowly pare back their $120 billion a month in bond purchases. More of that talk is expected at their annual symposium, which begins Thursday.
*****
&gt; The Fed chairman’s speech is typically the highlight of the annual event, and various Fed chairs have used Jackson Hole to send important messages. The question is whether Jerome Powell will channel his speech Friday morning to provide more details on how the Fed could begin to unwind its bond buying, and even whether he is personally ready to embrace it.
*****
&gt; “We’re not expecting a big policy reveal at this meeting,” said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. short strategy at Bank of America. “I don’t think Powell wants to front run the [September] meeting, given the myriad of voices that are out there. I don’t think this is the time when Powell really wants to make a splash.”
*****
&gt; Besides the Fed, the week has a few economic reports. Existing home sales are released Monday; new home sales Tuesday and durable goods Wednesday. Friday has personal consumption expenditures data and the inflation index, closely watched by the Fed.
*****
&gt; Earnings are also expected from companies including Best Buy and Nordstrom on Tuesday, Salesforce.com on Wednesday and HP and Dell Technologies on Thursday.
*****
&gt; # Fed and markets
But the Fed will matter most, as investors will also keep an eye on how the economy is responding to the spread of the Covid delta variant. Stocks were lower in the past week, with the S&amp;P 500 down 0.6%.
*****
&gt; There could be some volatility around the Fed’s symposium, after the release this past Tuesday of minutes from the last official meeting rattled investors. The minutes described most members of the Federal Open Market Committee as being ready to taper this year if the economy is strong enough. Cabana said he changed his view after that release and now expects the Fed to begin paring back purchases in November, rather than January.
*****
&gt; “We just think this signal in communications is pretty clear,” he said. “For now, it’s safe to say they are wanting to start later this year, and we think the data will allow them to do that.”
*****
&gt; As for Powell, “he’s not going to announce taper. What we anticipate is that he’s going to give a live speech that talks about a lot of the progress that has been made since the start of Covid, and there’s a lot of it,” said Cabana. He said Powell could reiterate that the Fed will be data dependent in its decision to taper, and that many Fed officials believe it could make sufficient progress toward that goal later this year.
*****
&gt; The minutes caused hiccups in markets as investors reacted to the idea that the Fed will take its first steps toward peeling away the extraordinary amount of policy it used to fight the impact of the pandemic. Tapering the bond program could take months, but once it ends it could herald the onset of rate hikes.
*****
&gt; Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, said Powell should provide a road map for how the Fed will taper, but with the caveat of being able to step back if Covid becomes more serious than expected.
*****
&gt; “The asset purchases were initially to stabilize financial conditions. ... There’s clearly a consensus building stronger than it even was at the last meeting in July, given how [Fed officials] have been speaking out since then,” said Swonk. “They want to wind down asset purchases. As they wind them down, they’re not hitting the brakes. They’re only lifting their foot off the accelerator. The difference is important for [Powell] to lay out at Jackson Hole.”
*****
&gt; Swonk said the Fed needs to provide a road map for tapering, but also with off ramps in the event that Covid is worse than expected.
*****
&gt; “To avoid this becoming a tantrum and avoid financial markets seizing up again, he wants to get the messaging out and the context of it, as much as possible,” Swonk said. “If this becomes a disorderly reaction and things are melting down, they would have to pivot. Where we’re at is these types of purchases are no longer justified and may be detrimental in terms of how much liquidity they’re putting into financial markets when its no longer needed.”

&gt; # September Almanac: DJIA, S&amp;P 500 &amp; NASDAQ Worst Month of Year

&gt; Start of the business year, end of summer vacations, and back to school once made September a leading barometer month in first 60 years of 20th century, now portfolio managers back after Labor Day tend to clean house Since 1950, September is the worst performing month of the year for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971), Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 (since 1979). After four solid years from 1995-1998 during the dot.com bubble buildup, S&amp;P 500 was down five Septembers straight from 1999-2003. In the 17 years since, S&amp;P 500 has advanced 11 times in September and declined six times.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/40afab5bf8a7d5d83f5c0df66416bd63/64275cde73d35d0e-b1/s400x600/f24c1395359fa121818eb1387e2f2cde70364a83.jpg))**

&gt; In post-election years, September’s overall rank improves modestly in post-election years going back to 1953 (third or fourth worst month depending on index). Average losses are little changed. Although September 2001 does influence the average declines, the fact remains DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have declined in 9 of the last 17 post-election year Septembers. Russell 2000 has the best post-election year record, up seven times in 10 years.

&gt; # US Dollar Breaks Out

&gt; After roughly two months of declines, at the end of May the US dollar (proxied by Bloomberg's dollar index) found support around the lows from the first week of the year. Since then, the dollar has rallied 4.13%, moving back above its moving averages in the process which have also acted as support ever since. This week alone the dollar has gained 1.4%, and that upward move brings the dollar to the highest levels since early November and the early spring highs when the index stopped short of its 200-DMA.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082021-Dollar.png))**

&gt; Taking a step back to look at the past five years, those lows that were reached earlier this spring and at the start of the year can actually be traced all the way back to early 2018 lows. Similarly, the recent highs that were taken out this week are around the same levels as the early 2016 lows. With the dollar now having broken out, it is no longer at the low end of that five-year range.

&gt; # One of the Best Weeks of the Year for Claims

&gt; Initial jobless claims hit another pandemic low this week dropping to 348K from last week's 2K upwardly revised reading of 377K. That was also 16K below expectations and the first better than expected print in six weeks. While recent releases have disappointed relative to forecasts, this week did mark the fourth week in a row that claims have dropped. That is the longest stretch of consecutive declines since a six-week streak ending on June 4th.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081921-Initial-Jobless-Claims-SA.png))**

&gt; On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, initial claims fell to 308.57K which is again the lowest level since the start of the pandemic. Meanwhile, pandemic unemployment assistance claims ticked up to 109.38K from 103.85K the previous week. The main state driving that increase was Ohio which saw claims more than double. Maryland, Oregon, and California were the other states to have seen the biggest increase in PUA claims. Those increases also come even as the program is slated to end in just two weeks on September 4th.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081921-Initial-Jobless-Claims-NSA.png))**

&gt; As for the decline in claims for unadjusted regular state programs, we would caution against reading too deep into the number on account of strong seasonal tailwinds. As shown below, the current week of the year (33rd) is tied at second for the week of the year that most often sees claims decline. As shown in the second chart below, there has only been one year, last year, in which claims were higher week over week in the 33rd week of the year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081921-Initial-Jobless-Claims-Seasonal-1a.png))**

&gt; Seasonally adjusted continuing claims missed expectations by 20K this week, but at 2.82 million, this week's reading still marked a third consecutive decline. As such, claims are still at the lowest level of the pandemic and are closing in on coming within one million from the March 2020 levels.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081921-Con-Jobless-Claims-SA.png))**

&gt; While the most recent reading on continuing claims was lower, purely looking at regular state claims does not show the full picture. Including all other programs creates some additional lag meaning the most recent data is through the last week of July. Through that week, total claims fell below 12 million for the first time of the pandemic, totaling 11.76 million. Driving that decline were 79.9K and 66.08K declines in regular state and PEUC programs. The biggest decline came from the extended benefits program, though. That program saw claims get more than cut in half after a significant uptick the previous week. Throughout the month of July, claim counts for the extended benefits program were particularly volatile. They started off the month with a sub-100K reading of 98.4K, then rose all the way up to 343.5K, dropped to 239.6K, then rose again to 398.8K before falling back down to 177.9K in the week of July 30th.

&gt; # Homebuilder Sentiment: The Next Big Miss

&gt; Prior to the pandemic, the NAHB's record monthly reading on homebuilder sentiment was back in December 1998 when the index hit 78. Last November, the sentiment bar was set even higher when the index reached 90. Since then, though, two-thirds of the releases have declined month over month. The most recent release saw the index drop five more points to 75, marking the first time in a year that homebuilder sentiment came in below the pre-pandemic record high. Additionally, August's 5-point drop is the largest one-month decline since last April when the index collapsed by a record 42 points at the onset of the pandemic. It is also tied with a dozen other months for the seventh-largest month-over-month decline in the history of the index going back to 1985.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081721-NAHB-1a.png))**

&gt; While the release indicates worsening, but still historically strong, sentiment among homebuilders, it can be added to the growing list of economic indicators that have been coming in well below expectations. As we noted in last week's Bespoke Report, Citi Surprise indices measuring how economic data comes in relative to estimates tipped into negative territory last week. That was as the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment survey saw the biggest miss relative to expectations on record. Today's reading on homebuilders was not far off those results. The five-point miss relative to expectations was the largest since last April and is tied with 4 other months (April and May 2006, November 2008, and October 2014) for the six largest miss going back to at least 2003.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081721-NAHB-1b.png))**

&gt; Driving the decline in the headline reading were five-point drops in present sales and traffic. Even though there has been deterioration in those readings on current conditions, future sales have held up better going unchanged at 81.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081721-NAHB-3.png))**

&gt; Looking across regions, the ones that have seen COVID cases rising the most of late, namely in the South and Midwest, generally saw sharp drops in homebuilder sentiment in August although those are in the context of longer-term declines. The Northeast and the West, on the other hand, are off of their peaks but each region did show an uptick in sentiment for August.

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend a great trading week ahead r/StockMarket. :)",8,3,1629547466.0,2021-08-21T12:04:26+00:00,t3_p8q9mc,StockMarket
188,DELL,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning August 23rd, 2021","Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 23rd, 2021.

# **Fed officials will seek to avoid a tantrum as they keep ‘taper talk’ going at Jackson Hole - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/20/fed-officials-will-seek-to-avoid-a-tantrum-as-they-keep-taper-talk-going-at-jackson-hole.html)**
*****
&gt; The Federal Reserve’s efforts to reverse its easy policy will be a dominant theme for markets in the week ahead, as central bankers gather in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
*****
&gt; The central bankers may even look relaxed against the backdrop of the Grand Tetons in the crisp late August air. But they will be under pressure to gently steer toward less policy support, without creating a market tantrum.
*****
&gt; Federal Reserve officials, in numerous recent speeches and interviews, have already managed to speed up expectations for when they could begin to slowly pare back their $120 billion a month in bond purchases. More of that talk is expected at their annual symposium, which begins Thursday.
*****
&gt; The Fed chairman’s speech is typically the highlight of the annual event, and various Fed chairs have used Jackson Hole to send important messages. The question is whether Jerome Powell will channel his speech Friday morning to provide more details on how the Fed could begin to unwind its bond buying, and even whether he is personally ready to embrace it.
*****
&gt; “We’re not expecting a big policy reveal at this meeting,” said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. short strategy at Bank of America. “I don’t think Powell wants to front run the [September] meeting, given the myriad of voices that are out there. I don’t think this is the time when Powell really wants to make a splash.”
*****
&gt; Besides the Fed, the week has a few economic reports. Existing home sales are released Monday; new home sales Tuesday and durable goods Wednesday. Friday has personal consumption expenditures data and the inflation index, closely watched by the Fed.
*****
&gt; Earnings are also expected from companies including Best Buy and Nordstrom on Tuesday, Salesforce.com on Wednesday and HP and Dell Technologies on Thursday.
*****
&gt; # Fed and markets
But the Fed will matter most, as investors will also keep an eye on how the economy is responding to the spread of the Covid delta variant. Stocks were lower in the past week, with the S&amp;P 500 down 0.6%.
*****
&gt; There could be some volatility around the Fed’s symposium, after the release this past Tuesday of minutes from the last official meeting rattled investors. The minutes described most members of the Federal Open Market Committee as being ready to taper this year if the economy is strong enough. Cabana said he changed his view after that release and now expects the Fed to begin paring back purchases in November, rather than January.
*****
&gt; “We just think this signal in communications is pretty clear,” he said. “For now, it’s safe to say they are wanting to start later this year, and we think the data will allow them to do that.”
*****
&gt; As for Powell, “he’s not going to announce taper. What we anticipate is that he’s going to give a live speech that talks about a lot of the progress that has been made since the start of Covid, and there’s a lot of it,” said Cabana. He said Powell could reiterate that the Fed will be data dependent in its decision to taper, and that many Fed officials believe it could make sufficient progress toward that goal later this year.
*****
&gt; The minutes caused hiccups in markets as investors reacted to the idea that the Fed will take its first steps toward peeling away the extraordinary amount of policy it used to fight the impact of the pandemic. Tapering the bond program could take months, but once it ends it could herald the onset of rate hikes.
*****
&gt; Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, said Powell should provide a road map for how the Fed will taper, but with the caveat of being able to step back if Covid becomes more serious than expected.
*****
&gt; “The asset purchases were initially to stabilize financial conditions. ... There’s clearly a consensus building stronger than it even was at the last meeting in July, given how [Fed officials] have been speaking out since then,” said Swonk. “They want to wind down asset purchases. As they wind them down, they’re not hitting the brakes. They’re only lifting their foot off the accelerator. The difference is important for [Powell] to lay out at Jackson Hole.”
*****
&gt; Swonk said the Fed needs to provide a road map for tapering, but also with off ramps in the event that Covid is worse than expected.
*****
&gt; “To avoid this becoming a tantrum and avoid financial markets seizing up again, he wants to get the messaging out and the context of it, as much as possible,” Swonk said. “If this becomes a disorderly reaction and things are melting down, they would have to pivot. Where we’re at is these types of purchases are no longer justified and may be detrimental in terms of how much liquidity they’re putting into financial markets when its no longer needed.”

&gt; # September Almanac: DJIA, S&amp;P 500 &amp; NASDAQ Worst Month of Year

&gt; Start of the business year, end of summer vacations, and back to school once made September a leading barometer month in first 60 years of 20th century, now portfolio managers back after Labor Day tend to clean house Since 1950, September is the worst performing month of the year for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971), Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 (since 1979). After four solid years from 1995-1998 during the dot.com bubble buildup, S&amp;P 500 was down five Septembers straight from 1999-2003. In the 17 years since, S&amp;P 500 has advanced 11 times in September and declined six times.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/40afab5bf8a7d5d83f5c0df66416bd63/64275cde73d35d0e-b1/s400x600/f24c1395359fa121818eb1387e2f2cde70364a83.jpg))**

&gt; In post-election years, September’s overall rank improves modestly in post-election years going back to 1953 (third or fourth worst month depending on index). Average losses are little changed. Although September 2001 does influence the average declines, the fact remains DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have declined in 9 of the last 17 post-election year Septembers. Russell 2000 has the best post-election year record, up seven times in 10 years.

&gt; # US Dollar Breaks Out

&gt; After roughly two months of declines, at the end of May the US dollar (proxied by Bloomberg's dollar index) found support around the lows from the first week of the year. Since then, the dollar has rallied 4.13%, moving back above its moving averages in the process which have also acted as support ever since. This week alone the dollar has gained 1.4%, and that upward move brings the dollar to the highest levels since early November and the early spring highs when the index stopped short of its 200-DMA.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082021-Dollar.png))**

&gt; Taking a step back to look at the past five years, those lows that were reached earlier this spring and at the start of the year can actually be traced all the way back to early 2018 lows. Similarly, the recent highs that were taken out this week are around the same levels as the early 2016 lows. With the dollar now having broken out, it is no longer at the low end of that five-year range.

&gt; # One of the Best Weeks of the Year for Claims

&gt; Initial jobless claims hit another pandemic low this week dropping to 348K from last week's 2K upwardly revised reading of 377K. That was also 16K below expectations and the first better than expected print in six weeks. While recent releases have disappointed relative to forecasts, this week did mark the fourth week in a row that claims have dropped. That is the longest stretch of consecutive declines since a six-week streak ending on June 4th.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081921-Initial-Jobless-Claims-SA.png))**

&gt; On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, initial claims fell to 308.57K which is again the lowest level since the start of the pandemic. Meanwhile, pandemic unemployment assistance claims ticked up to 109.38K from 103.85K the previous week. The main state driving that increase was Ohio which saw claims more than double. Maryland, Oregon, and California were the other states to have seen the biggest increase in PUA claims. Those increases also come even as the program is slated to end in just two weeks on September 4th.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081921-Initial-Jobless-Claims-NSA.png))**

&gt; As for the decline in claims for unadjusted regular state programs, we would caution against reading too deep into the number on account of strong seasonal tailwinds. As shown below, the current week of the year (33rd) is tied at second for the week of the year that most often sees claims decline. As shown in the second chart below, there has only been one year, last year, in which claims were higher week over week in the 33rd week of the year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081921-Initial-Jobless-Claims-Seasonal-1a.png))**

&gt; Seasonally adjusted continuing claims missed expectations by 20K this week, but at 2.82 million, this week's reading still marked a third consecutive decline. As such, claims are still at the lowest level of the pandemic and are closing in on coming within one million from the March 2020 levels.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081921-Con-Jobless-Claims-SA.png))**

&gt; While the most recent reading on continuing claims was lower, purely looking at regular state claims does not show the full picture. Including all other programs creates some additional lag meaning the most recent data is through the last week of July. Through that week, total claims fell below 12 million for the first time of the pandemic, totaling 11.76 million. Driving that decline were 79.9K and 66.08K declines in regular state and PEUC programs. The biggest decline came from the extended benefits program, though. That program saw claims get more than cut in half after a significant uptick the previous week. Throughout the month of July, claim counts for the extended benefits program were particularly volatile. They started off the month with a sub-100K reading of 98.4K, then rose all the way up to 343.5K, dropped to 239.6K, then rose again to 398.8K before falling back down to 177.9K in the week of July 30th.

&gt; # Homebuilder Sentiment: The Next Big Miss

&gt; Prior to the pandemic, the NAHB's record monthly reading on homebuilder sentiment was back in December 1998 when the index hit 78. Last November, the sentiment bar was set even higher when the index reached 90. Since then, though, two-thirds of the releases have declined month over month. The most recent release saw the index drop five more points to 75, marking the first time in a year that homebuilder sentiment came in below the pre-pandemic record high. Additionally, August's 5-point drop is the largest one-month decline since last April when the index collapsed by a record 42 points at the onset of the pandemic. It is also tied with a dozen other months for the seventh-largest month-over-month decline in the history of the index going back to 1985.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081721-NAHB-1a.png))**

&gt; While the release indicates worsening, but still historically strong, sentiment among homebuilders, it can be added to the growing list of economic indicators that have been coming in well below expectations. As we noted in last week's Bespoke Report, Citi Surprise indices measuring how economic data comes in relative to estimates tipped into negative territory last week. That was as the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment survey saw the biggest miss relative to expectations on record. Today's reading on homebuilders was not far off those results. The five-point miss relative to expectations was the largest since last April and is tied with 4 other months (April and May 2006, November 2008, and October 2014) for the six largest miss going back to at least 2003.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081721-NAHB-1b.png))**

&gt; Driving the decline in the headline reading were five-point drops in present sales and traffic. Even though there has been deterioration in those readings on current conditions, future sales have held up better going unchanged at 81.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081721-NAHB-3.png))**

&gt; Looking across regions, the ones that have seen COVID cases rising the most of late, namely in the South and Midwest, generally saw sharp drops in homebuilder sentiment in August although those are in the context of longer-term declines. The Northeast and the West, on the other hand, are off of their peaks but each region did show an uptick in sentiment for August.

30,DELL,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning August 23rd, 2021","Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 23rd, 2021.

# **Fed officials will seek to avoid a tantrum as they keep ‘taper talk’ going at Jackson Hole - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/20/fed-officials-will-seek-to-avoid-a-tantrum-as-they-keep-taper-talk-going-at-jackson-hole.html)**
*****
&gt; The Federal Reserve’s efforts to reverse its easy policy will be a dominant theme for markets in the week ahead, as central bankers gather in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
*****
&gt; The central bankers may even look relaxed against the backdrop of the Grand Tetons in the crisp late August air. But they will be under pressure to gently steer toward less policy support, without creating a market tantrum.
*****
&gt; Federal Reserve officials, in numerous recent speeches and interviews, have already managed to speed up expectations for when they could begin to slowly pare back their $120 billion a month in bond purchases. More of that talk is expected at their annual symposium, which begins Thursday.
*****
&gt; The Fed chairman’s speech is typically the highlight of the annual event, and various Fed chairs have used Jackson Hole to send important messages. The question is whether Jerome Powell will channel his speech Friday morning to provide more details on how the Fed could begin to unwind its bond buying, and even whether he is personally ready to embrace it.
*****
&gt; “We’re not expecting a big policy reveal at this meeting,” said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. short strategy at Bank of America. “I don’t think Powell wants to front run the [September] meeting, given the myriad of voices that are out there. I don’t think this is the time when Powell really wants to make a splash.”
*****
&gt; Besides the Fed, the week has a few economic reports. Existing home sales are released Monday; new home sales Tuesday and durable goods Wednesday. Friday has personal consumption expenditures data and the inflation index, closely watched by the Fed.
*****
&gt; Earnings are also expected from companies including Best Buy and Nordstrom on Tuesday, Salesforce.com on Wednesday and HP and Dell Technologies on Thursday.
*****
&gt; # Fed and markets
But the Fed will matter most, as investors will also keep an eye on how the economy is responding to the spread of the Covid delta variant. Stocks were lower in the past week, with the S&amp;P 500 down 0.6%.
*****
&gt; There could be some volatility around the Fed’s symposium, after the release this past Tuesday of minutes from the last official meeting rattled investors. The minutes described most members of the Federal Open Market Committee as being ready to taper this year if the economy is strong enough. Cabana said he changed his view after that release and now expects the Fed to begin paring back purchases in November, rather than January.
*****
&gt; “We just think this signal in communications is pretty clear,” he said. “For now, it’s safe to say they are wanting to start later this year, and we think the data will allow them to do that.”
*****
&gt; As for Powell, “he’s not going to announce taper. What we anticipate is that he’s going to give a live speech that talks about a lot of the progress that has been made since the start of Covid, and there’s a lot of it,” said Cabana. He said Powell could reiterate that the Fed will be data dependent in its decision to taper, and that many Fed officials believe it could make sufficient progress toward that goal later this year.
*****
&gt; The minutes caused hiccups in markets as investors reacted to the idea that the Fed will take its first steps toward peeling away the extraordinary amount of policy it used to fight the impact of the pandemic. Tapering the bond program could take months, but once it ends it could herald the onset of rate hikes.
*****
&gt; Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, said Powell should provide a road map for how the Fed will taper, but with the caveat of being able to step back if Covid becomes more serious than expected.
*****
&gt; “The asset purchases were initially to stabilize financial conditions. ... There’s clearly a consensus building stronger than it even was at the last meeting in July, given how [Fed officials] have been speaking out since then,” said Swonk. “They want to wind down asset purchases. As they wind them down, they’re not hitting the brakes. They’re only lifting their foot off the accelerator. The difference is important for [Powell] to lay out at Jackson Hole.”
*****
&gt; Swonk said the Fed needs to provide a road map for tapering, but also with off ramps in the event that Covid is worse than expected.
*****
&gt; “To avoid this becoming a tantrum and avoid financial markets seizing up again, he wants to get the messaging out and the context of it, as much as possible,” Swonk said. “If this becomes a disorderly reaction and things are melting down, they would have to pivot. Where we’re at is these types of purchases are no longer justified and may be detrimental in terms of how much liquidity they’re putting into financial markets when its no longer needed.”

&gt; # September Almanac: DJIA, S&amp;P 500 &amp; NASDAQ Worst Month of Year

&gt; Start of the business year, end of summer vacations, and back to school once made September a leading barometer month in first 60 years of 20th century, now portfolio managers back after Labor Day tend to clean house Since 1950, September is the worst performing month of the year for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971), Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 (since 1979). After four solid years from 1995-1998 during the dot.com bubble buildup, S&amp;P 500 was down five Septembers straight from 1999-2003. In the 17 years since, S&amp;P 500 has advanced 11 times in September and declined six times.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/40afab5bf8a7d5d83f5c0df66416bd63/64275cde73d35d0e-b1/s400x600/f24c1395359fa121818eb1387e2f2cde70364a83.jpg))**

&gt; In post-election years, September’s overall rank improves modestly in post-election years going back to 1953 (third or fourth worst month depending on index). Average losses are little changed. Although September 2001 does influence the average declines, the fact remains DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have declined in 9 of the last 17 post-election year Septembers. Russell 2000 has the best post-election year record, up seven times in 10 years.

&gt; # US Dollar Breaks Out

&gt; After roughly two months of declines, at the end of May the US dollar (proxied by Bloomberg's dollar index) found support around the lows from the first week of the year. Since then, the dollar has rallied 4.13%, moving back above its moving averages in the process which have also acted as support ever since. This week alone the dollar has gained 1.4%, and that upward move brings the dollar to the highest levels since early November and the early spring highs when the index stopped short of its 200-DMA.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082021-Dollar.png))**

&gt; Taking a step back to look at the past five years, those lows that were reached earlier this spring and at the start of the year can actually be traced all the way back to early 2018 lows. Similarly, the recent highs that were taken out this week are around the same levels as the early 2016 lows. With the dollar now having broken out, it is no longer at the low end of that five-year range.

&gt; # One of the Best Weeks of the Year for Claims

&gt; Initial jobless claims hit another pandemic low this week dropping to 348K from last week's 2K upwardly revised reading of 377K. That was also 16K below expectations and the first better than expected print in six weeks. While recent releases have disappointed relative to forecasts, this week did mark the fourth week in a row that claims have dropped. That is the longest stretch of consecutive declines since a six-week streak ending on June 4th.

&gt; On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, initial claims fell to 308.57K which is again the lowest level since the start of the pandemic. Meanwhile, pandemic unemployment assistance claims ticked up to 109.38K from 103.85K the previous week. The main state driving that increase was Ohio which saw claims more than double. Maryland, Oregon, and California were the other states to have seen the biggest increase in PUA claims. Those increases also come even as the program is slated to end in just two weeks on September 4th.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081921-Initial-Jobless-Claims-NSA.png))**

&gt; As for the decline in claims for unadjusted regular state programs, we would caution against reading too deep into the number on account of strong seasonal tailwinds. As shown below, the current week of the year (33rd) is tied at second for the week of the year that most often sees claims decline. As shown in the second chart below, there has only been one year, last year, in which claims were higher week over week in the 33rd week of the year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081921-Initial-Jobless-Claims-Seasonal-1a.png))**

&gt; Seasonally adjusted continuing claims missed expectations by 20K this week, but at 2.82 million, this week's reading still marked a third consecutive decline. As such, claims are still at the lowest level of the pandemic and are closing in on coming within one million from the March 2020 levels.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081921-Con-Jobless-Claims-SA.png))**

&gt; While the most recent reading on continuing claims was lower, purely looking at regular state claims does not show the full picture. Including all other programs creates some additional lag meaning the most recent data is through the last week of July. Through that week, total claims fell below 12 million for the first time of the pandemic, totaling 11.76 million. Driving that decline were 79.9K and 66.08K declines in regular state and PEUC programs. The biggest decline came from the extended benefits program, though. That program saw claims get more than cut in half after a significant uptick the previous week. Throughout the month of July, claim counts for the extended benefits program were particularly volatile. They started off the month with a sub-100K reading of 98.4K, then rose all the way up to 343.5K, dropped to 239.6K, then rose again to 398.8K before falling back down to 177.9K in the week of July 30th.

&gt; # Homebuilder Sentiment: The Next Big Miss

&gt; Prior to the pandemic, the NAHB's record monthly reading on homebuilder sentiment was back in December 1998 when the index hit 78. Last November, the sentiment bar was set even higher when the index reached 90. Since then, though, two-thirds of the releases have declined month over month. The most recent release saw the index drop five more points to 75, marking the first time in a year that homebuilder sentiment came in below the pre-pandemic record high. Additionally, August's 5-point drop is the largest one-month decline since last April when the index collapsed by a record 42 points at the onset of the pandemic. It is also tied with a dozen other months for the seventh-largest month-over-month decline in the history of the index going back to 1985.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081721-NAHB-1a.png))**

&gt; While the release indicates worsening, but still historically strong, sentiment among homebuilders, it can be added to the growing list of economic indicators that have been coming in well below expectations. As we noted in last week's Bespoke Report, Citi Surprise indices measuring how economic data comes in relative to estimates tipped into negative territory last week. That was as the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment survey saw the biggest miss relative to expectations on record. Today's reading on homebuilders was not far off those results. The five-point miss relative to expectations was the largest since last April and is tied with 4 other months (April and May 2006, November 2008, and October 2014) for the six largest miss going back to at least 2003.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081721-NAHB-1b.png))**

&gt; Driving the decline in the headline reading were five-point drops in present sales and traffic. Even though there has been deterioration in those readings on current conditions, future sales have held up better going unchanged at 81.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081721-NAHB-3.png))**

&gt; Looking across regions, the ones that have seen COVID cases rising the most of late, namely in the South and Midwest, generally saw sharp drops in homebuilder sentiment in August although those are in the context of longer-term declines. The Northeast and the West, on the other hand, are off of their peaks but each region did show an uptick in sentiment for August.

Most are not around anymore.  Some still are. TXN for example, hit \~$99 in 2000 and didn't see that again until 2017.  CSCO $82 high in 2000, that is still the ATH.  NOK 62.5, same story.  Dell has gone private and re-public since then.

My lesson learned, you can bet on Fidel Castro, but most revolutions fail.  Bet on the dictator.  In finance, that means bet on google, amzn, SPY/VTI.  Let DDD/SSYS go...

In April 2021, [VMware and Dell announced](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210414005849/en/) that they had reached an agreement to spin VMware out of Dell, and part of that announcement, they also announced a ""$11.5B to $12.0B special cash dividend that VMware will provide to all stockholders ranges from $27.43 per share to $28.62 per share, based on outstanding shares as of March 16, 2021"" with the deal slated to close ""during the fourth quarter of calendar 2021, subject to certain conditions"".

On the date that this announcement was made, I was holding \~500 shares of VMware stock. I have since retained all of those shares.

My question is, in order to ensure I receive that dividend, do I need to continue holding those shares until the close date of that spin-off agreement later this year, or can I sell some or all of those shares today and still receive the dividend?",6,6,1629120422.0,2021-08-16T13:27:02+00:00,t3_p5g1fu,stocks

**Conclusion**

    Meta Materials is going to take the market by surprise. They have a wide diversity of product applications across many industries. Industries include consumer electronics, health and wellness, aerospace automotive, and clean energy. META has changed the manufacturing process of chips. If NanoWeb can be used with any metal, including silicon, then imagine how much you can save on semiconductor chips. Instead of making full silicon discs, companies could use a plastic wafer and print the NanoWeb onto it. META's NanoWeb and holoOPTIC technology is unparalleled to the current competition. Their technology can be produced faster and cheaper than competitors. Their technology is way beyond our current imagination. 
    
    The semiconductor chip shortage is a sign. Chips are going to be as essential to our everyday lives as water. The shortage showed the U.S that they are behind the curve. The U.S wants to be in the position to not only supply themselves with chips but also export them to other countries. Biden's $50B plan will play a strategic role in controlling chip supply. META will also seek to capitalize on the semiconductor chip boom. The RML tech will change semiconductor chip manufacturing. This is a great long-term investment. Potentially one of the best silicon stocks to buy. Also, check out the \[META homepage\](https://metamaterial.com/). The video up on their homepage goes hard.

**Conclusion**

	Meta Materials is going to take the market by surprise. They have a wide diversity of product applications across many industries. Industries include consumer electronics, health and wellness, aerospace automotive, and clean energy. META has changed the manufacturing process of chips. If NanoWeb can be used with any metal, including silicon, then imagine how much you can save on semiconductor chips. Instead of making full silicon discs, companies could use a plastic wafer and print the NanoWeb onto it. META's NanoWeb and holoOPTIC technology is unparalleled to the current competition. Their technology can be produced faster and cheaper than competitors. Their technology is way beyond our current imagination. 

	The semiconductor chip shortage is a sign. Chips are going to be as essential to our everyday lives as water. The shortage showed the U.S that they are behind the curve. The U.S wants to be in the position to not only supply themselves with chips but also export them to other countries. Biden's $50B plan will play a strategic role in controlling chip supply. META will also seek to capitalize on the semiconductor chip boom. The RML tech will change semiconductor chip manufacturing. This is a great long-term investment. Potentially one of the best silicon stocks to buy. Also, check out the \[META homepage\](https://metamaterial.com/). The video up on their homepage goes hard.

	The U.S heavily relies on Asia to produce chips. This is a major issue because instead of building the infrastructure to produce our own chips, we end up spending billions on foreign products. To combat this problem, the Senate has approved a $52B subsidy plan to help semiconductor manufacturers in the U.S to help boost fabrication. However, it will take time to build the infrastructure.

**Management**

	New CEO Cristiano Amon has worked at Qualcomm since 1995. Amon has helped spearhead Qualcomm's 5G strategy and global markets. Before working at Qualcomm, Amon was the CTO of Vésper (wireless operator in Brazil). He also worked for NEC and Velocom. Amon has a good track record. He's been in the industry for a long time while holding multiple leadership roles. Qualcomm might be his biggest leadership role yet. I have no doubt that Cristiano Amon will use his prior knowledge to help guide QCOM into a bright future. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion**

	We've seen tremendous growth across the semiconductor industry over the past two years. The recent chip shortage caused by COVID-19 has been driving QCOM's stock price up. Semiconductor manufactures are having trouble keeping up with consumer demand. It is uncertain when the chip shortage will sort itself out. Some experts have said that it could take several years before supply catches up to demand. A few key takeaways from QCOM's financials are Gross Margin and Price/Book ratio. Gross Margin has remained consistent over the past five years. The average gross margin in the semiconductor industry is 33.76%. QCOM is leading the pack at 60% gross margin. The PB ratio seems a little high to me. QCOM currently has a PB ratio of 21.51. To put that into perspective, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) has a PB ratio of 9.05. While Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has a PB of 17.05. This tells me that QCOM might be overvalued at its current price. Overall, I'd say the company's financials are pretty average in the industry.

109,DELL,Thoughts on a PC (gaming) focused portfolio?,"I'm considering adding some of the following (12), but I'm more than willing to trim the list. 
My rationale, especially for the components portion, is that you really can't avoid these companies and maintain general compatibility and quality (AMD vs NVDA, AMD vs INTC, WDC vs STX). 
Brands like corsair and asus certainly charge a premium, but also make high quality, very good looking products. 
The large office/personal computer companies at the end of the list have been branching out into high end (but also high premium) prebuilt gaming pcs and laptops

Components:

* NVDA
* AMD
* INTC

* STX
* CRSR
* ASUUY

I was also thinking about retailers (BBY, NEGG), but I'm not sure I want brick and mortar exposure, at least not with this.
Dividend yield is also pretty negligible thanks to most of the companies not paying at all, or paying very little *ahem* NVIDIA.

110,DELL,Work from home index?,"Some companies seem to be more reluctant than others to keep work from home going in a post covid world.  Lots of workers, including myself, view work from home as a perk and would prioritize a company that offered it over one that didn't. 

Where I'm going with this is that in the near future is that any company that offers work from home will have a bigger/better talent pool to choose from while hiring and might see some better numbers.

111,DELL,What if you invested in the Linkedin Top 10 Companies to work for each year? I looked into it,"For 5 years now (They skipped 2020/Covid) LinkedIn has produced a list of top companies to work for (called various things through the years).  I wanted to see what the (basic) results would be if one invested in the top ten companies.  However, not all of the companies are public or were at the time of the list.  So I skipped those and continued on the list till I had the top 10 public companies.  Also, the formatting is hard so I just included total results for each period and the total for all 5 periods.  I did not include dividends.  

This is not perfect, but just for fun.  I based the results on the begining and ending share price.  It's not weighted in any way, just percent gain (or loss) for each company during that period.  Same for SPY.

To put us in context, Corsair has been trading sideways for about 3-4 months since its peak to 45 produced by the boom in disruptive companies. It is a recent IPO, it went public in September 2020.

It is clear that there are funds interested in keeping it below 35, as there have been moments of 6% drop in the aftermarket with a ridiculous volume : less than 50,000.

Also on the other hand there is downward pressure: Eagletree Capital, as I understand, has to reduce its position in Corsair from the current 61% to 10% in less than 5 years, which is helping to keep the price flat.

Edit: apparently this eagletree Capital was a fake new, so not confirmed. anyways they reduced position from 70% to 61%, so they are atleast taking some profit.

Let's talk numbers:

Corsair's latest report has shattered all expectations:

· EPS of 0.58 versus the 0.25 estimate.

· A gross margin of 30.3%.

· Revenue increased 72%  YoY.

· Adjusted ebitda was up 197% to 80.4M

· They reduced debt by 28M

**Basically beat all 4 estimates.**

And Corsair improved forecast from 1.8B to 2.1B. They tend to be quite cautious with their estimates, just look at how they have far outperformed analysts in past quarters.

And now, let's get to the key point. I see a very repeated comment and that is the comparison between Corsair and Logitech or Dell.

They have nothing to do with each other.

Corsair's strength is how well it utilizes its capital to obtain profitable ventures.

This is where the good stuff comes in.

· Corsair owns elgato. That company that has a monopoly on capture, green screens, spotlights, streamdeck... and aggressively increasing their products to cameras, capture, mic stands, microphones... I don't know how high up you are in the streaming world, but elgato is literally in any setup. And if you see the exponential growth of Twitch, add 1 + 1. Not only for streamers, but also the work at home movement is driving the sale of their products.

· Corsair has just acquired in February 2021 Visuals by impulse, a company dedicated to the creation of overlays and alerts, to further monopolize the stream environment.

· Corsair owns Scuf gaming, a company dedicated to custom controllers for pc, xbox or play station.

· Corsair owns Gamer Sensei, a platform that connects professionals or people skilled in video games with others who want to improve their level.

· Corsair owns origin pc, a platform for selling peripherals and pre-assembled computers.

**The acquisition of Visuals by impulse, gamer sensei and scuf gaming occurred in 2019, 2020 and 2021. In other words, they have an insurmountable acquisition hunger.**

And of course, Corsair, market leader in peripherals and components in various niche markets, the king of RGB, amazing towers, probably the best software and a HUB to control all your components.

Basically it remains to expand into the mobile sector, but their intentions are quite clear, they are looking to be leaders in multiple sectors.

When I was younger, about 10 years ago, if you liked video games you were basically the class geek, and your chances of being bullied increased dramatically.

Now things have changed, the freak is basically the one who doesn't play. And watching streamings has become the new television for the new generations.

One of the arguments against corsair is that once the pandemic is over people will stop playing and do other things. You can tell they have never met a gamer. When a person starts, they don't stop. You don't buy a $2500 computer and trade it in for a $500 computer later. And a gamer, is always a gamer.

It is also very relevant the fact that there is still a lot of population without internet access and the video game sector is one of the most expanding sectors ahead, which is a tremendously bullish argument.

And another plus point, this incredible surpassing of expectations has happened in an environment with chip problems, where people didn't have graphics cards (or they were extremely expensive), nor did they have PS5 to buy and stream with it, and Corsair itself has said that they focused on building only premium products with high margins to stay competent. This clearly says how much potential they have if they have overcome such a difficult time.

**TL:DR:**

I could give many empty arguments, talk about shorts, to the moon.... but that's not the point. We are talking about a temporarily manipulated high growth company trading at a FORWARD PER of almost 15. It is a simply ridiculous situation, and even more with the current valuations shown by the market.

45-50$ is the fair value, but we can go even higher.",565,163,1623508530.0,2021-06-12T14:35:30+00:00,t3_ny84rr,wallstreetbets
190,DELL,$AMAT DD and why semi-conductor stocks are a great play right now,"As usual for me, I took some of my adderall prescription and it drove me to write a DD on my most watched stocks at the moment.

Applied Matterials Inc ($AMAT) is a large-cap stock, and I base my play upon it's high quality and strong momentum; as well as confidence in semi-conductor stocks. AMAT provides manufacturing equipment, services and software to the semiconductor, display and related industries.

Applied Materials is the leading producer of equipment and materials for producing microchips, TV's (OLED's/LCD's), and solar panels. They also have their services business which offers manufacturing consulting and automation software. They are based in California, but have factories around the world, with Asian customers accounting for 80% of it's revenue.

To summarise:

- Semi-conductor systems make 60% of revenue, this is for equipment used to manufacture semiconductor devices such as microprocessors and memory.

- Applied global services provide a quarter of revenue. This is for integrated solutions to optimise equipment, performance and productivity,

- And the display markets account for 10% of it's revenue. Providing products for manufacturing LCD's and OLED displays.

- It's customers include Apple, HP and Dell.

With the current silicon shortage, I expect the stock to surge further when this shortage slows down.

- AMAT has been stair stepping higher in the recent bull trend, as a leader in one of the stronger industry groups in tech (semiconductors), I believe it among other semi-conductor stocks are a great buy for a long right now.

- AMAT's 5-year return on Capital Employed is 25.1%, which is a strong indicator that it has the power to grow profitably. AMAT's share price has had a 72.1% return relative to the market over the past 12 months.

- Furthermore, it's earnings outlook is improving. Analysts are still raising their earnings estimates for the company. For the year, the stock currently has an earnings estimate of $6.53 per share, up 56.59% from a year ago.

- AMAT is testing the 10 week line on the weekly chart, after declining recently. This has formed a handle, and if you rebound from here to get above the handle, there could be a breakout.

- As Nvidia recently broke out we could see other semiconductor stocks such as TSM, AMAT, LCRX, and ASML following this pattern.

- ASML is also in the buy range after finding support at the 10-week line.

Why semi-conductor stocks are a good play: 
- The Innovator IBD Breakout Oppurtunities Index (BOUT) jumped 152% from March 2020 lows before pulling back in February. This ETF is now integrating leading components manufacturers such as DELL, ZBRA, AMAT, LRCX, UCTT, and TER.

Jim Cramer himself is now looking at AMAT, TSM and AMD.

""Cramer recently said that if investors think chips are truly in short supply and we need capital equipment, then the company they most need is Lam Research (LRCX), other than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM)""

""Jim Cramer recently named chip equipment major Applied Materials (AMAT), as one of the stocks that got away.

He called out the bull market in semiconductor equipment. We need to make more chips, he said, and companies like Applied Materials can make that happen.

The semiconductor equipment major reported mixed fiscal-second-quarter earnings and received a number of positive reviews and price-target upgrades from Wall Street analysts.""

Anyway, aside from Cramer there are many other reasons to own semi-conductor stocks.

One of my primary reasons is the growth in data centre demand. This was why I bought NVDA calls at $620, aside from the stock-split. AMD is also bringing out new data-centre GPUs.

- There has been a huge growth in demand for data centre equipment, due to the rise in work-from-home driving data centre's to increase their cloud-storage capacities. This has fuelled demand for data-centre chips from data centre operators.

- The data centre market is expected to grow to $519.34 billion during 2021-2025, driven by the growing clout of cloud services and digitization. Further, increase in adoption of multi-cloud and network upgrade to support 5G is fueling growth.

- New semiconductor manufacturing processes from 10nm, 7nm, to 5nm and 3nm has opened new business avenues.

- 5G deployment is spuring further sector growth.

- VR and AR devices, gaming, wearables and drones, have grown in use due to Coronavirus - hence leading to a increase in usage of online services globablly.

- Improvements in DRAM and NAND pricing are fueling semi-conductor stocks catering to the memory market.

- AMD, and TSM delivered good performance in the first quarter driven by data centre demand.

I think my adderall has worn off now, but I will update with a part 2 later on. I'm going to open a position in TSMC, AMAT, LCRX, and ASML today. I will look at AMD also.",17,17,1623332540.0,2021-06-10T13:42:20+00:00,t3_nwnysp,wallstreetbets

27,DELL,Intel is over looked by AMD hype,"Intel is possibly the only chip maker that's fairly or under valued atm, amd is making 800m free cash flow a year and worth 90b, nvidia makes 4.3b and valued at 348b (insane) and intel has 15b free cash flow and valued at 218b, regardless of what your personal favourite brand/company is for making chips, intel is the clear winner financially and price wise. It also pays a dividend which means little but it's a bonus for what is a growing company numbers wise. I would also add I love dell and is a personal favourite stock to buy Atm but as they are not a chip maker doesn't really fit in here",37,145,1622236890.0,2021-05-28T21:21:30+00:00,t3_nn7zx6,investing
87,DELL,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, May 28, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, May 28, 2021**

Stocks gained on Friday, with market participants encouraged by new economic data on consumer spending, income and inflation, and a strong Weekly unemployment report. The market has made a remarkable recovery, particularly in technology, after the market tumbled 4% following the April Consumer Price Index roughly two weeks ago. In my view, as I have said for weeks, the recovery in the market confirms that the initial sell-off driven by inflationary fears forcing the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected was overblown.

New government data on Friday showed personal income fell less than expected in April, but still pulled back after March's stimulus-fueled surge. Personal income fell by 13.1% in April compared to March, less than the 14.2% drop expected. This follows a 20.9% increase during March which had been buoyed by the distribution of $1,400 stimulus checks to most Americans. 

In another report, the Department of Commerce reported core personal consumption expenditures increased 3.1% in April from a year earlier, blowing past the Fed’s traditional 2% target. Federal Reserve members consider the core PCE to be the gauge of inflation. The strong inflation readings reported by the Commerce Department on Friday had been widely anticipated as the pandemic's grip eases, thanks to vaccinations, and will have no impact on monetary policy. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly stated that higher inflation will be transitory. Supply-chain constraints combined, labor shortages in certain industries, and rising demand as the US economy recovers from the coronavirus-induced recession have all contributed to higher inflationary readings. These are all factors that are widely considered transitory, meaning not permanent. In an April 28 statement, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said, “An episode of one-time price increases as the economy reopens is not likely to lead to persistent year-over-year inflation into the future. Clogged supply-chains won’t affect Federal Reserve policy because they’re temporary and expected to resolve themselves.” Moreover, he said “For inflation to move up in a persistent way that moves expectations up, that would take some time, and you would think it would be likely we would be in very strong employment for that to happen.” In other words, Powell is saying he expects issues driving inflation higher to resolve themselves moving forward and doesn’t expect inflationary pressures to materialize until the labor market further improves.

In remarks this week, members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), reiterated their stance that they were not yet concerned that new inflation data would force the Fed to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he believed increases in inflation would be “mostly temporary” and that the Fed was “not quite there yet” when it came to discussing tapering its asset purchase program. In separate comments, Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said she did not want the Fed to be “overly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judging the outlook for inflation.” 

Richard Clarida, Vice Chairman of the Fed, offered a slightly different view but one that is in-line with what the Federal Reserve has already said publicly in the past. Clarida said, “there will come a time in upcoming meetings” when the Fed would consider tapering the asset purchase program but that “it is going to depend on the flow of data”. The Fed is currently buying $120 billion a month in government-issued and government-backed securities, and has pledged to continue doing that until the economy is more fully recovered.

This reaffirms the market that the Fed is not on a set timeline when it comes to rolling back current accommodative policies and will, as they have said time and again, wait for concrete data before any considerations are made. This follows a similar statement from Jerome Powell back in April 14, which proves market participants shouldn’t worry about quantitative easing tapering, in my opinion. Powell said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.”

The Department of Labor’s Weekly Unemployment Report showed jobless claims fell for the fourth straight week to yet another pandemic-era low, an encouraging sign that the labor market is improving following the extremely disappointing April Jobs report, which showed 266,000 new jobs added in the month, far below estimated of more than 1 million and a sharp deceleration in job growth compared to March. 

* **Initial jobless claims, week ended May 22:** 406,000 vs. 425,000 expected and 444,000 the week prior
* **Continuing claims, week ended May 15:** 3.642 million vs. 3.680 million expected and a revised 3.738 the week prior

88,DELL,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning May 24th, 2021","Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 24th, 2021.

# **Stocks could be volatile in week ahead amid turbulence from cryptocurrency - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/21/stocks-could-be-volatile-in-week-ahead-amid-turbulence-from-cryptocurrency.html)**
*****
&gt; The trading pattern of the past two weeks – particularly alongside cryptocurrency’s movements – suggests stocks could continue to be volatile in the week ahead.
*****
&gt; Investors are watching the wild swings in bitcoin and trying to gauge whether technology shares can gain traction after a rally attempt in the past week.
*****
&gt; The Dow and S&amp;P 500 were lower in the past week, but Nasdaq was slightly higher, helped by a positive move in tech, as well as buying in biotech and big cap growth names like FANG members Alphabet, Facebook and Netflix.
*****
&gt; A steep plunge in bitcoin after China announced new regulations soured the mood for risk assets during the past week. The U.S. also called for stricter compliance with the IRS. Further, on Friday, China said it would crack down on bitcoin mining and trading.
*****
&gt; “What’s interesting is the market is being bullied around by where bitcoin goes,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer with Bleakley Advisory Group. Bitcoin plunged by as much as 30% on Wednesday, to about $30,000. Though it recovered to above $42,000, it slid again on Friday.
*****
&gt; The cryptocurrency was down about 9% late Friday, hovering around $36,000, according to Coin Metrics.
*****
&gt; “Bitcoin is a poster child for risk appetite,” said Boockvar. “It tells you the stock market is more on uneven ground, if we’re getting dragged along by bitcoin.”
*****
&gt; There is some key data in the week ahead. Consumer confidence, home price data and new home sales are out on Tuesday. Durable goods will be released Thursday, and the consumer sentiment report is issued Friday.
*****
&gt; But the most important data will be the personal income and spending data, which includes the personal consumption expenditure price deflator, the Fed’s preferred inflation measure.
*****
&gt; “The key to next week is going to be the inflation numbers. The inflation numbers are now becoming the new payroll numbers in terms of market performance,” said Boockvar. “What will also be interesting is inside the consumer confidence numbers, is where the inflation expectations go.”
*****
&gt; The consumer price index was surprisingly hot when released last week, showing core inflation at a year over year pace of 3% in April. The core PCE price index was up 1.8% year over year in March.
*****
&gt; In the week ahead, earnings season is winding down but there continue to be reports from retailers, like Best Buy, Costco and Nordstrom. NVIDIA and Dell also report.
*****
&gt; # No correction yet
&gt; As the market has chopped around this month, dip buyers have stepped into the declines and snapped up perceived bargains.
*****
&gt; Some strategists do not see a correction just yet, though pullbacks could continue.
*****
&gt; “For me, my framework is we can only get a 10% correction when we have a liquidity set back, when we have a policy tightening,” said Barry Knapp, managing partner of Ironsides Macroeconomics. “In any of the little disturbances, we are getting about a 4% to 6% pullback.
*****
&gt; Knapp said investors are fretting too much about higher interest rates being a problem for technology companies. “You should be in the cyclical parts of tech,” he said. Knapp noted that subsectors like semiconductors and software should do well with the economic reopening and global manufacturing rebound.
*****
&gt; Tech squeaked out a slight gain in the past week, gaining 0.1%, but semiconductors popped nearly 3%. Software was up 0.2%.
*****
&gt; The Nasdaq was 0.3% higher on the week to 13,470, while the Dow was off a half percent at 34,207. The S&amp;P 500 was down 0.4% to 4,155.
*****
&gt; The best performing sector was real estate investment trusts, up 0.9%, followed by health care, up 0.7%. Biotech was higher on the week with the IBB iShares Nasdaq Biotech ETF, up 1.1%.
*****
&gt; “It wouldn’t shock me if we went straight back to new highs,” Knapp said. “Part of the reason I thought we would trade in a range, was earnings season was done but net revisions is surging.”
*****
&gt; He said earnings for the S&amp;P 500 are now expected to be up 7% more for the year than when the first quarter reporting season began.
*****
&gt; Knapp expects the Fed may discuss tapering its bond buying at its Jackson Hole meeting in late summer, and that is the likely trigger for a correction. Back to World War II, he said the first correction after a recession was triggered by the Fed normalizing policy.
*****
&gt; “Last cycle, we had eight of those,” he said. “Every attempt they made to normalize policy caused one of these risk off events.”
*****
&gt; Knapp said it’s natural for investors to be focused on the Fed now. “It’s an uncertainty shock,” he said. “It will cause a correction and everyone is focused on it. The Fed has not really changed its policy since the depths of the pandemic.”
*****
&gt; Knapp said Treasury yields have drifted lower during efforts in Washington to reach a bipartisan plan on infrastructure spending. But he expects the market to react differently in the next two weeks, since he expects those efforts will clearly fail and Democrats will focus on a big spending program that will increase the deficit.
*****
&gt; The bitcoin crypto mania was lifted by the idea of big spending from Washington, and the infrastructure spending could be positive. “The thing that was the surprise in 2021 that really drove the mania was the blue wave and then the spending blowout,” he said, noting bitcoin gained on the potential for inflation and big deficit spending.

&gt; # Economic Surprise Index Tips Negative For The First Time In A Year

&gt; While the overall trend of economic data has been for further improvement, things have slowed recently relative to expectations. In the charts below, we show the charts of the Citi Economic Surprise indices for the US, Emerging Markets, the Eurozone, and the entire world. Broadly speaking, positive readings indicate that economic data is coming in better than forecasts while negative readings indicate the opposite. Every region of the globe has pulled back over the past couple of months but for the most part, current readings remain at the high end of their historical ranges. In fact, the indices for Emerging Markets, Eurozone, and the whole globe all sit in the top 3% of all readings in their histories. The one place that is not the case is the US. Since last summer, the surprise index has been trending lower off of record levels, and just yesterday, it hit it tipped negative for the first time since June 2nd of last year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/CESI.png))**

&gt; Lasting 248 trading days, this was the longest streak of consecutive positive readings in the index's history dating back to 2003. The only other streak that lasted nearly as long was a 189 day long one which came to an end in June 2018.

&gt; # Post-Election-Year June: Third Worst S&amp;P 500 Month

&gt; June has shone brighter on NASDAQ stocks over the last 50 years as a rule ranking sixth with a 0.9% average gain, up 28 of 50 years. This contributes to NASDAQ’s “Best Eight Months” which ends in June. June ranks near the bottom on the Dow Jones Industrials just above September since 1950 with an average loss of 0.2%. S&amp;P 500 performs similarly poorly, ranking ninth, but essentially flat (0.1% average gain). Small caps also tend to fare well in June. Russell 2000 has averaged 0.8% in the month since 1979.

&gt; In post-election years since 1953, June still ranks poorly and its average loss for DJIA increases to –1.1% while S&amp;P 500′s modestly positive performance becomes a 0.6% loss. DJIA struggles the most, advancing in just four post-election year Junes (1977, 1985, 1997 and 2017). Russell 2000 fares best, up seven times in ten years with an average gain of 1.2%. NASDAQ lands in the middle, advancing 50% of the time with an average gain of 0.4%

&gt; # May Manufacturing Starting Off Strong

&gt; The first manufacturing data for May came out this morning with the release of the New York Fed's Empire State Manufacturing Survey. General business conditions remain at historically strong levels although there was some slowing in May as was expected. After hitting the highest level since October 2017 last month, it was expected to fall to 23.9 in May. The index did in fact decline, but only to 24.3. While lower, that is still around some of the strongest levels (excluding last month) in three years as more businesses continue to report improvements in business conditions than weakness.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-Empire-1.png))**

&gt; Breadth in this month's report was pretty mixed; namely with regards to current conditions versus expectations. Every index is still showing an expansionary reading with particular strength out of the indices for the present situation. In fact, most of those indices still sit in the top decile of their historical range with a few like those for unfilled orders, delivery times, and prices even at or just off of record highs. But there were a handful that moved lower: delivery times, inventories, and number of employees.

&gt; Regarding expectations, it was much harder to find an increase. Delivery times and technology spending were the only two of these indices to rise month over month. While many indices for expectations still sit at historically strong levels, there are more that are middling within their respective historical ranges. Overall, the report showed that New York area firms have seen a peak in optimism even as they continue to report strong conditions.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-Empire-Table.png))**

&gt; Demand certainly appears to be one area without much in the way of weakness. New orders rose 2 points month over month to 28.9. That is the highest level in just over 15 years and the only other readings as high occurred throughout late 2003 to mid-2004. Those orders are making their way out the door at an increased rate too as shipments climbed to 29.7. That index has been making a vertical climb since the winter as it reached its highest level since August 2007.

&gt; Despite this, NY area firms are not fulfilling orders fast enough. Last month saw the Unfilled Orders index rise by one of the largest amounts in a single month on record, and it continued to climb albeit by a much smaller 0.2 points in May. The only month on record with a higher reading in unfilled orders was September 2001. Inventories were one of the few current condition indices to fall in May, although the reading still indicated growth. In other words, those unfilled orders are not necessarily drawing down on inventory levels.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-Empire-2.png))**

&gt; Supply chains are one of the main areas that are likely holding things back. Higher readings in the delivery times index mean that businesses are reporting that it takes longer for products to reach their destination. Even after falling 4.5 points in May off of the April record, the current level sits well above the prior record high of 16.2 from March 2018.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-Empire-3.png))**

&gt; In addition to taking longer for products to get to where they are going, the price point is on the rise. Both indices for prices paid and received rose to record highs in May. In fact, over the past two months, there has not been a single respondent to have reported a decrease in prices paid. That is the first time that has occurred since February and March 2012.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-Empire-4.png))**

&gt; Last week saw a blockbuster job openings report and the Empire Fed survey is showing a similar willingness to take on more workers. The current conditions index for the number of employees continues to show that businesses are on net increasing their workforce, though at a slowed pace from April. Additionally, the index is at a much less elevated part of its range (the 81st percentile) relative to other indices within the report, but the much more elevated reading in expectations (98th percentile) would indicate the businesses would like to take on far more workers. That is, there appears to be a bit of a disconnect between the actual number of new hires and businesses' expectations to take on more workers. Potentially as a result of an inability to hire enough workers, the average workweek has continued to climb. At 18.7, the index is at its highest level in a decade.

&gt; # Homebuilder Sentiment Holds Steady

&gt; Our new Constitution is now established, everything seems to promise it will be durable; but, in this world, nothing is certain except death and taxes,” Benjamin Franklin

&gt; The national average on a 30 year fixed rate mortgage currently sits around 3.06%, little changed over the past month. Homebuilder sentiment as measured by the NAHB Housing Market Index similarly went unchanged in May staying at 83. Although it has been six months since the record high of 90 without much of a push back up to those record levels, homebuilder sentiment continues to come in well above anything observed prior to the pandemic. Commentary from the NAHB noted that the strong reading on homebuilder confidence is thanks to the low housing inventories, low rates, and strong demand, despite the headwinds of rising costs. While that could have played into the small decline in traffic, future sales did tick higher.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-NAHB-HL.png))**
&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-NAHB-Table.png))**

&gt; Whereas the headline number was flat on the month, readings based on each region saw much more variety. By far the largest move was for the Northeast. Since running back up to the record high back in February, homebuilder sentiment in the Northeast has fallen for three straight months and is now at the lowest level since January. The decline in sentiment in the Northeast is relatively recent. Whereas the region tied its record high earlier this year, the other regions all peaked out in the fall. For the Midwest, the declines have kept coming with 3 point declines in each of the past three months alone. The West and South, on the other hand, have found some respite. The South has ticked higher by 2 points in back-to-back months as it reached the highest level since December. Meanwhile, the West was unchanged at 91 in May.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-NAHB-Region.png))**

&gt; As for homebuilder stocks, the iShares US Home Construction ETF (ITB) had been trading in overbought territory throughout most of the spring but in the past couple of weeks, it has come back down to Earth. Last Wednesday, ITB successfully tested its 50-DMA with a small bounce at the tail end of the week. So far today, it has turned lower alongside the broader market with a 1.35% decline. While that means Friday's close marks a lower high, for the time being, the uptrend is still intact.

&gt; # Increased Caution Across Sentiment Indicators

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has been holding up at its 50-DMA in the past week while more speculative areas of the market (i.e. crypto) have experienced wild swings. As a result, sentiment on the part of individual investors has not seen much of a move. The American Association of Individual Investors' weekly reading on bullish sentiment was little changed this week climbing half of one percentage point to 37%. Although that was not a large move in the past week, sentiment has taken a big hit over the past month having fallen from well above 50%. In spite of that big drop and even though sentiment is around the lowest levels of the past half-year, the current sentiment level is within one percentage point of the historical average. In other words, optimism is low versus recent history but is very much middling from a longer term perspective.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052021-AAII-Bull.png))**

&gt; Meanwhile, bearish sentiment fell 0.7 percentage points to 26.3%. Unlike bullish sentiment, that is a bit lower than the historical average of 30.5%

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052021-AAII-Bear.png))**

&gt; Those corresponding moves meant the bull-bear spread climbed to 10.7 from 9.5 the prior week. Excluding last week, that is still one of the lowest readings since February.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052021-AAII-Bull-Bear.png))**

&gt; Neutral sentiment has been the star of the show recently. The gain this week was tiny at only 0.2 percentage points, but nonetheless, it marked the fifth consecutive week in which neutral sentiment has risen. At 36.7%, it is now at the highest level since the second week of 2020.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052021-AAII-Neutral.png))**

&gt; The Investors Intelligence survey of equity newsletter writers took a less optimistic tone this week as bullish sentiment fell 4.1 percentage points to a ten-week low of 54.5%. Bearish sentiment was unchanged at the highest level since the end of March. The survey also questions respondents on whether or not they expect a correction. That reading rose 4.1 percentage points to 28.3% in the biggest one-week uptick since the last week of April when it rose 4.7 percentage points. That leaves the reading at the highest level since the week of March 10th. Before that, you would need to go back to September 23rd to find as high of a reading.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052021-II-Correction.png))**

&gt; Another sentiment reading that has taken an even more dramatically negative tone lately has been the National Association of Active Investment Managers Exposure Index. This index measures how exposed to equities managers are where readings of 200 would mean they are leveraged long, 100 would be fully invested long, 0 would be neutral, -100 is fully short, and -200 is leveraged short. This week saw the index fall another 2.65 points after a massive 40-point decline last week. That is the lowest level since last March and April of last year. Altogether, while sentiment still favors bulls, there has been a more cautious tone that has been reflected in managers reducing exposure to equities.

112,DELL,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning May 24th, 2021","Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 24th, 2021.

# **Stocks could be volatile in week ahead amid turbulence from cryptocurrency - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/21/stocks-could-be-volatile-in-week-ahead-amid-turbulence-from-cryptocurrency.html)**
*****
&gt; The trading pattern of the past two weeks – particularly alongside cryptocurrency’s movements – suggests stocks could continue to be volatile in the week ahead.
*****
&gt; Investors are watching the wild swings in b/itcoin and trying to gauge whether technology shares can gain traction after a rally attempt in the past week.
*****
&gt; The Dow and S&amp;P 500 were lower in the past week, but Nasdaq was slightly higher, helped by a positive move in tech, as well as buying in biotech and big cap growth names like FANG members Alphabet, Facebook and Netflix.
*****
&gt; A steep plunge in b/itcoin after China announced new regulations soured the mood for risk assets during the past week. The U.S. also called for stricter compliance with the IRS. Further, on Friday, China said it would crack down on b/itcoin mining and trading.
*****
&gt; “What’s interesting is the market is being bullied around by where b/itcoin goes,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer with Bleakley Advisory Group. B/itcoin plunged by as much as 30% on Wednesday, to about $30,000. Though it recovered to above $42,000, it slid again on Friday.
*****
&gt; The cryptocurrency was down about 9% late Friday, hovering around $36,000, according to Coin Metrics.
*****
&gt; “B/itcoin is a poster child for risk appetite,” said Boockvar. “It tells you the stock market is more on uneven ground, if we’re getting dragged along by b/itcoin.”
*****
&gt; There is some key data in the week ahead. Consumer confidence, home price data and new home sales are out on Tuesday. Durable goods will be released Thursday, and the consumer sentiment report is issued Friday.
*****
&gt; But the most important data will be the personal income and spending data, which includes the personal consumption expenditure price deflator, the Fed’s preferred inflation measure.
*****
&gt; “The key to next week is going to be the inflation numbers. The inflation numbers are now becoming the new payroll numbers in terms of market performance,” said Boockvar. “What will also be interesting is inside the consumer confidence numbers, is where the inflation expectations go.”
*****
&gt; The consumer price index was surprisingly hot when released last week, showing core inflation at a year over year pace of 3% in April. The core PCE price index was up 1.8% year over year in March.
*****
&gt; In the week ahead, earnings season is winding down but there continue to be reports from retailers, like Best Buy, Costco and Nordstrom. NVIDIA and Dell also report.
*****
&gt; # No correction yet
&gt; As the market has chopped around this month, dip buyers have stepped into the declines and snapped up perceived bargains.
*****
&gt; Some strategists do not see a correction just yet, though pullbacks could continue.
*****
&gt; “For me, my framework is we can only get a 10% correction when we have a liquidity set back, when we have a policy tightening,” said Barry Knapp, managing partner of Ironsides Macroeconomics. “In any of the little disturbances, we are getting about a 4% to 6% pullback.
*****
&gt; Knapp said investors are fretting too much about higher interest rates being a problem for technology companies. “You should be in the cyclical parts of tech,” he said. Knapp noted that subsectors like semiconductors and software should do well with the economic reopening and global manufacturing rebound.
*****
&gt; Tech squeaked out a slight gain in the past week, gaining 0.1%, but semiconductors popped nearly 3%. Software was up 0.2%.
*****
&gt; The Nasdaq was 0.3% higher on the week to 13,470, while the Dow was off a half percent at 34,207. The S&amp;P 500 was down 0.4% to 4,155.
*****
&gt; The best performing sector was real estate investment trusts, up 0.9%, followed by health care, up 0.7%. Biotech was higher on the week with the IBB iShares Nasdaq Biotech ETF, up 1.1%.
*****
&gt; “It wouldn’t shock me if we went straight back to new highs,” Knapp said. “Part of the reason I thought we would trade in a range, was earnings season was done but net revisions is surging.”
*****
&gt; He said earnings for the S&amp;P 500 are now expected to be up 7% more for the year than when the first quarter reporting season began.
*****
&gt; Knapp expects the Fed may discuss tapering its bond buying at its Jackson Hole meeting in late summer, and that is the likely trigger for a correction. Back to World War II, he said the first correction after a recession was triggered by the Fed normalizing policy.
*****
&gt; “Last cycle, we had eight of those,” he said. “Every attempt they made to normalize policy caused one of these risk off events.”
*****
&gt; Knapp said it’s natural for investors to be focused on the Fed now. “It’s an uncertainty shock,” he said. “It will cause a correction and everyone is focused on it. The Fed has not really changed its policy since the depths of the pandemic.”
*****
&gt; Knapp said Treasury yields have drifted lower during efforts in Washington to reach a bipartisan plan on infrastructure spending. But he expects the market to react differently in the next two weeks, since he expects those efforts will clearly fail and Democrats will focus on a big spending program that will increase the deficit.
*****
&gt; The b/itcoin crypto mania was lifted by the idea of big spending from Washington, and the infrastructure spending could be positive. “The thing that was the surprise in 2021 that really drove the mania was the blue wave and then the spending blowout,” he said, noting b/itcoin gained on the potential for inflation and big deficit spending.

&gt; # Economic Surprise Index Tips Negative For The First Time In A Year

&gt; While the overall trend of economic data has been for further improvement, things have slowed recently relative to expectations. In the charts below, we show the charts of the Citi Economic Surprise indices for the US, Emerging Markets, the Eurozone, and the entire world. Broadly speaking, positive readings indicate that economic data is coming in better than forecasts while negative readings indicate the opposite. Every region of the globe has pulled back over the past couple of months but for the most part, current readings remain at the high end of their historical ranges. In fact, the indices for Emerging Markets, Eurozone, and the whole globe all sit in the top 3% of all readings in their histories. The one place that is not the case is the US. Since last summer, the surprise index has been trending lower off of record levels, and just yesterday, it hit it tipped negative for the first time since June 2nd of last year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/CESI.png))**

&gt; Lasting 248 trading days, this was the longest streak of consecutive positive readings in the index's history dating back to 2003. The only other streak that lasted nearly as long was a 189 day long one which came to an end in June 2018.

&gt; # Post-Election-Year June: Third Worst S&amp;P 500 Month

&gt; June has shone brighter on NASDAQ stocks over the last 50 years as a rule ranking sixth with a 0.9% average gain, up 28 of 50 years. This contributes to NASDAQ’s “Best Eight Months” which ends in June. June ranks near the bottom on the Dow Jones Industrials just above September since 1950 with an average loss of 0.2%. S&amp;P 500 performs similarly poorly, ranking ninth, but essentially flat (0.1% average gain). Small caps also tend to fare well in June. Russell 2000 has averaged 0.8% in the month since 1979.

&gt; In post-election years since 1953, June still ranks poorly and its average loss for DJIA increases to –1.1% while S&amp;P 500′s modestly positive performance becomes a 0.6% loss. DJIA struggles the most, advancing in just four post-election year Junes (1977, 1985, 1997 and 2017). Russell 2000 fares best, up seven times in ten years with an average gain of 1.2%. NASDAQ lands in the middle, advancing 50% of the time with an average gain of 0.4%

&gt; # May Manufacturing Starting Off Strong

&gt; The first manufacturing data for May came out this morning with the release of the New York Fed's Empire State Manufacturing Survey. General business conditions remain at historically strong levels although there was some slowing in May as was expected. After hitting the highest level since October 2017 last month, it was expected to fall to 23.9 in May. The index did in fact decline, but only to 24.3. While lower, that is still around some of the strongest levels (excluding last month) in three years as more businesses continue to report improvements in business conditions than weakness.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-Empire-1.png))**

&gt; Breadth in this month's report was pretty mixed; namely with regards to current conditions versus expectations. Every index is still showing an expansionary reading with particular strength out of the indices for the present situation. In fact, most of those indices still sit in the top decile of their historical range with a few like those for unfilled orders, delivery times, and prices even at or just off of record highs. But there were a handful that moved lower: delivery times, inventories, and number of employees.

&gt; Regarding expectations, it was much harder to find an increase. Delivery times and technology spending were the only two of these indices to rise month over month. While many indices for expectations still sit at historically strong levels, there are more that are middling within their respective historical ranges. Overall, the report showed that New York area firms have seen a peak in optimism even as they continue to report strong conditions.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-Empire-Table.png))**

&gt; Demand certainly appears to be one area without much in the way of weakness. New orders rose 2 points month over month to 28.9. That is the highest level in just over 15 years and the only other readings as high occurred throughout late 2003 to mid-2004. Those orders are making their way out the door at an increased rate too as shipments climbed to 29.7. That index has been making a vertical climb since the winter as it reached its highest level since August 2007.

&gt; Despite this, NY area firms are not fulfilling orders fast enough. Last month saw the Unfilled Orders index rise by one of the largest amounts in a single month on record, and it continued to climb albeit by a much smaller 0.2 points in May. The only month on record with a higher reading in unfilled orders was September 2001. Inventories were one of the few current condition indices to fall in May, although the reading still indicated growth. In other words, those unfilled orders are not necessarily drawing down on inventory levels.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-Empire-2.png))**

&gt; Supply chains are one of the main areas that are likely holding things back. Higher readings in the delivery times index mean that businesses are reporting that it takes longer for products to reach their destination. Even after falling 4.5 points in May off of the April record, the current level sits well above the prior record high of 16.2 from March 2018.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-Empire-3.png))**

&gt; In addition to taking longer for products to get to where they are going, the price point is on the rise. Both indices for prices paid and received rose to record highs in May. In fact, over the past two months, there has not been a single respondent to have reported a decrease in prices paid. That is the first time that has occurred since February and March 2012.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-Empire-4.png))**

&gt; Last week saw a blockbuster job openings report and the Empire Fed survey is showing a similar willingness to take on more workers. The current conditions index for the number of employees continues to show that businesses are on net increasing their workforce, though at a slowed pace from April. Additionally, the index is at a much less elevated part of its range (the 81st percentile) relative to other indices within the report, but the much more elevated reading in expectations (98th percentile) would indicate the businesses would like to take on far more workers. That is, there appears to be a bit of a disconnect between the actual number of new hires and businesses' expectations to take on more workers. Potentially as a result of an inability to hire enough workers, the average workweek has continued to climb. At 18.7, the index is at its highest level in a decade.

&gt; # Homebuilder Sentiment Holds Steady

&gt; Our new Constitution is now established, everything seems to promise it will be durable; but, in this world, nothing is certain except death and taxes,” Benjamin Franklin

&gt; The national average on a 30 year fixed rate mortgage currently sits around 3.06%, little changed over the past month. Homebuilder sentiment as measured by the NAHB Housing Market Index similarly went unchanged in May staying at 83. Although it has been six months since the record high of 90 without much of a push back up to those record levels, homebuilder sentiment continues to come in well above anything observed prior to the pandemic. Commentary from the NAHB noted that the strong reading on homebuilder confidence is thanks to the low housing inventories, low rates, and strong demand, despite the headwinds of rising costs. While that could have played into the small decline in traffic, future sales did tick higher.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-NAHB-HL.png))**
&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-NAHB-Table.png))**

&gt; Whereas the headline number was flat on the month, readings based on each region saw much more variety. By far the largest move was for the Northeast. Since running back up to the record high back in February, homebuilder sentiment in the Northeast has fallen for three straight months and is now at the lowest level since January. The decline in sentiment in the Northeast is relatively recent. Whereas the region tied its record high earlier this year, the other regions all peaked out in the fall. For the Midwest, the declines have kept coming with 3 point declines in each of the past three months alone. The West and South, on the other hand, have found some respite. The South has ticked higher by 2 points in back-to-back months as it reached the highest level since December. Meanwhile, the West was unchanged at 91 in May.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-NAHB-Region.png))**

&gt; As for homebuilder stocks, the iShares US Home Construction ETF (ITB) had been trading in overbought territory throughout most of the spring but in the past couple of weeks, it has come back down to Earth. Last Wednesday, ITB successfully tested its 50-DMA with a small bounce at the tail end of the week. So far today, it has turned lower alongside the broader market with a 1.35% decline. While that means Friday's close marks a lower high, for the time being, the uptrend is still intact.

&gt; # Increased Caution Across Sentiment Indicators

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has been holding up at its 50-DMA in the past week while more speculative areas of the market (i.e. crypto) have experienced wild swings. As a result, sentiment on the part of individual investors has not seen much of a move. The American Association of Individual Investors' weekly reading on bullish sentiment was little changed this week climbing half of one percentage point to 37%. Although that was not a large move in the past week, sentiment has taken a big hit over the past month having fallen from well above 50%. In spite of that big drop and even though sentiment is around the lowest levels of the past half-year, the current sentiment level is within one percentage point of the historical average. In other words, optimism is low versus recent history but is very much middling from a longer term perspective.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052021-AAII-Bull.png))**

&gt; Meanwhile, bearish sentiment fell 0.7 percentage points to 26.3%. Unlike bullish sentiment, that is a bit lower than the historical average of 30.5%

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052021-AAII-Bear.png))**

&gt; Those corresponding moves meant the bull-bear spread climbed to 10.7 from 9.5 the prior week. Excluding last week, that is still one of the lowest readings since February.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052021-AAII-Bull-Bear.png))**

&gt; Neutral sentiment has been the star of the show recently. The gain this week was tiny at only 0.2 percentage points, but nonetheless, it marked the fifth consecutive week in which neutral sentiment has risen. At 36.7%, it is now at the highest level since the second week of 2020.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052021-AAII-Neutral.png))**

&gt; The Investors Intelligence survey of equity newsletter writers took a less optimistic tone this week as bullish sentiment fell 4.1 percentage points to a ten-week low of 54.5%. Bearish sentiment was unchanged at the highest level since the end of March. The survey also questions respondents on whether or not they expect a correction. That reading rose 4.1 percentage points to 28.3% in the biggest one-week uptick since the last week of April when it rose 4.7 percentage points. That leaves the reading at the highest level since the week of March 10th. Before that, you would need to go back to September 23rd to find as high of a reading.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052021-II-Correction.png))**

&gt; Another sentiment reading that has taken an even more dramatically negative tone lately has been the National Association of Active Investment Managers Exposure Index. This index measures how exposed to equities managers are where readings of 200 would mean they are leveraged long, 100 would be fully invested long, 0 would be neutral, -100 is fully short, and -200 is leveraged short. This week saw the index fall another 2.65 points after a massive 40-point decline last week. That is the lowest level since last March and April of last year. Altogether, while sentiment still favors bulls, there has been a more cautious tone that has been reflected in managers reducing exposure to equities.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 24th, 2021.

# **Stocks could be volatile in week ahead amid turbulence from cryptocurrency - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/21/stocks-could-be-volatile-in-week-ahead-amid-turbulence-from-cryptocurrency.html)**
*****
&gt; The trading pattern of the past two weeks – particularly alongside cryptocurrency’s movements – suggests stocks could continue to be volatile in the week ahead.
*****
&gt; Investors are watching the wild swings in bitcoin and trying to gauge whether technology shares can gain traction after a rally attempt in the past week.
*****
&gt; The Dow and S&amp;P 500 were lower in the past week, but Nasdaq was slightly higher, helped by a positive move in tech, as well as buying in biotech and big cap growth names like FANG members Alphabet, Facebook and Netflix.
*****
&gt; A steep plunge in bitcoin after China announced new regulations soured the mood for risk assets during the past week. The U.S. also called for stricter compliance with the IRS. Further, on Friday, China said it would crack down on bitcoin mining and trading.
*****
&gt; “What’s interesting is the market is being bullied around by where bitcoin goes,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer with Bleakley Advisory Group. Bitcoin plunged by as much as 30% on Wednesday, to about $30,000. Though it recovered to above $42,000, it slid again on Friday.
*****
&gt; The cryptocurrency was down about 9% late Friday, hovering around $36,000, according to Coin Metrics.
*****
&gt; “Bitcoin is a poster child for risk appetite,” said Boockvar. “It tells you the stock market is more on uneven ground, if we’re getting dragged along by bitcoin.”
*****
&gt; There is some key data in the week ahead. Consumer confidence, home price data and new home sales are out on Tuesday. Durable goods will be released Thursday, and the consumer sentiment report is issued Friday.
*****
&gt; But the most important data will be the personal income and spending data, which includes the personal consumption expenditure price deflator, the Fed’s preferred inflation measure.
*****
&gt; “The key to next week is going to be the inflation numbers. The inflation numbers are now becoming the new payroll numbers in terms of market performance,” said Boockvar. “What will also be interesting is inside the consumer confidence numbers, is where the inflation expectations go.”
*****
&gt; The consumer price index was surprisingly hot when released last week, showing core inflation at a year over year pace of 3% in April. The core PCE price index was up 1.8% year over year in March.
*****
&gt; In the week ahead, earnings season is winding down but there continue to be reports from retailers, like Best Buy, Costco and Nordstrom. NVIDIA and Dell also report.
*****
&gt; # No correction yet
&gt; As the market has chopped around this month, dip buyers have stepped into the declines and snapped up perceived bargains.
*****
&gt; Some strategists do not see a correction just yet, though pullbacks could continue.
*****
&gt; “For me, my framework is we can only get a 10% correction when we have a liquidity set back, when we have a policy tightening,” said Barry Knapp, managing partner of Ironsides Macroeconomics. “In any of the little disturbances, we are getting about a 4% to 6% pullback.
*****
&gt; Knapp said investors are fretting too much about higher interest rates being a problem for technology companies. “You should be in the cyclical parts of tech,” he said. Knapp noted that subsectors like semiconductors and software should do well with the economic reopening and global manufacturing rebound.
*****
&gt; Tech squeaked out a slight gain in the past week, gaining 0.1%, but semiconductors popped nearly 3%. Software was up 0.2%.
*****
&gt; The Nasdaq was 0.3% higher on the week to 13,470, while the Dow was off a half percent at 34,207. The S&amp;P 500 was down 0.4% to 4,155.
*****
&gt; The best performing sector was real estate investment trusts, up 0.9%, followed by health care, up 0.7%. Biotech was higher on the week with the IBB iShares Nasdaq Biotech ETF, up 1.1%.
*****
&gt; “It wouldn’t shock me if we went straight back to new highs,” Knapp said. “Part of the reason I thought we would trade in a range, was earnings season was done but net revisions is surging.”
*****
&gt; He said earnings for the S&amp;P 500 are now expected to be up 7% more for the year than when the first quarter reporting season began.
*****
&gt; Knapp expects the Fed may discuss tapering its bond buying at its Jackson Hole meeting in late summer, and that is the likely trigger for a correction. Back to World War II, he said the first correction after a recession was triggered by the Fed normalizing policy.
*****
&gt; “Last cycle, we had eight of those,” he said. “Every attempt they made to normalize policy caused one of these risk off events.”
*****
&gt; Knapp said it’s natural for investors to be focused on the Fed now. “It’s an uncertainty shock,” he said. “It will cause a correction and everyone is focused on it. The Fed has not really changed its policy since the depths of the pandemic.”
*****
&gt; Knapp said Treasury yields have drifted lower during efforts in Washington to reach a bipartisan plan on infrastructure spending. But he expects the market to react differently in the next two weeks, since he expects those efforts will clearly fail and Democrats will focus on a big spending program that will increase the deficit.
*****
&gt; The bitcoin crypto mania was lifted by the idea of big spending from Washington, and the infrastructure spending could be positive. “The thing that was the surprise in 2021 that really drove the mania was the blue wave and then the spending blowout,” he said, noting bitcoin gained on the potential for inflation and big deficit spending.

&gt; # Economic Surprise Index Tips Negative For The First Time In A Year

&gt; While the overall trend of economic data has been for further improvement, things have slowed recently relative to expectations. In the charts below, we show the charts of the Citi Economic Surprise indices for the US, Emerging Markets, the Eurozone, and the entire world. Broadly speaking, positive readings indicate that economic data is coming in better than forecasts while negative readings indicate the opposite. Every region of the globe has pulled back over the past couple of months but for the most part, current readings remain at the high end of their historical ranges. In fact, the indices for Emerging Markets, Eurozone, and the whole globe all sit in the top 3% of all readings in their histories. The one place that is not the case is the US. Since last summer, the surprise index has been trending lower off of record levels, and just yesterday, it hit it tipped negative for the first time since June 2nd of last year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/CESI.png))**

&gt; Lasting 248 trading days, this was the longest streak of consecutive positive readings in the index's history dating back to 2003. The only other streak that lasted nearly as long was a 189 day long one which came to an end in June 2018.

&gt; # Post-Election-Year June: Third Worst S&amp;P 500 Month

&gt; June has shone brighter on NASDAQ stocks over the last 50 years as a rule ranking sixth with a 0.9% average gain, up 28 of 50 years. This contributes to NASDAQ’s “Best Eight Months” which ends in June. June ranks near the bottom on the Dow Jones Industrials just above September since 1950 with an average loss of 0.2%. S&amp;P 500 performs similarly poorly, ranking ninth, but essentially flat (0.1% average gain). Small caps also tend to fare well in June. Russell 2000 has averaged 0.8% in the month since 1979.

&gt; In post-election years since 1953, June still ranks poorly and its average loss for DJIA increases to –1.1% while S&amp;P 500′s modestly positive performance becomes a 0.6% loss. DJIA struggles the most, advancing in just four post-election year Junes (1977, 1985, 1997 and 2017). Russell 2000 fares best, up seven times in ten years with an average gain of 1.2%. NASDAQ lands in the middle, advancing 50% of the time with an average gain of 0.4%

&gt; # May Manufacturing Starting Off Strong

&gt; The first manufacturing data for May came out this morning with the release of the New York Fed's Empire State Manufacturing Survey. General business conditions remain at historically strong levels although there was some slowing in May as was expected. After hitting the highest level since October 2017 last month, it was expected to fall to 23.9 in May. The index did in fact decline, but only to 24.3. While lower, that is still around some of the strongest levels (excluding last month) in three years as more businesses continue to report improvements in business conditions than weakness.

&gt; Breadth in this month's report was pretty mixed; namely with regards to current conditions versus expectations. Every index is still showing an expansionary reading with particular strength out of the indices for the present situation. In fact, most of those indices still sit in the top decile of their historical range with a few like those for unfilled orders, delivery times, and prices even at or just off of record highs. But there were a handful that moved lower: delivery times, inventories, and number of employees.

&gt; Regarding expectations, it was much harder to find an increase. Delivery times and technology spending were the only two of these indices to rise month over month. While many indices for expectations still sit at historically strong levels, there are more that are middling within their respective historical ranges. Overall, the report showed that New York area firms have seen a peak in optimism even as they continue to report strong conditions.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-Empire-Table.png))**

&gt; Demand certainly appears to be one area without much in the way of weakness. New orders rose 2 points month over month to 28.9. That is the highest level in just over 15 years and the only other readings as high occurred throughout late 2003 to mid-2004. Those orders are making their way out the door at an increased rate too as shipments climbed to 29.7. That index has been making a vertical climb since the winter as it reached its highest level since August 2007.

&gt; Despite this, NY area firms are not fulfilling orders fast enough. Last month saw the Unfilled Orders index rise by one of the largest amounts in a single month on record, and it continued to climb albeit by a much smaller 0.2 points in May. The only month on record with a higher reading in unfilled orders was September 2001. Inventories were one of the few current condition indices to fall in May, although the reading still indicated growth. In other words, those unfilled orders are not necessarily drawing down on inventory levels.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-Empire-2.png))**

&gt; Supply chains are one of the main areas that are likely holding things back. Higher readings in the delivery times index mean that businesses are reporting that it takes longer for products to reach their destination. Even after falling 4.5 points in May off of the April record, the current level sits well above the prior record high of 16.2 from March 2018.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-Empire-3.png))**

&gt; In addition to taking longer for products to get to where they are going, the price point is on the rise. Both indices for prices paid and received rose to record highs in May. In fact, over the past two months, there has not been a single respondent to have reported a decrease in prices paid. That is the first time that has occurred since February and March 2012.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-Empire-4.png))**

&gt; Last week saw a blockbuster job openings report and the Empire Fed survey is showing a similar willingness to take on more workers. The current conditions index for the number of employees continues to show that businesses are on net increasing their workforce, though at a slowed pace from April. Additionally, the index is at a much less elevated part of its range (the 81st percentile) relative to other indices within the report, but the much more elevated reading in expectations (98th percentile) would indicate the businesses would like to take on far more workers. That is, there appears to be a bit of a disconnect between the actual number of new hires and businesses' expectations to take on more workers. Potentially as a result of an inability to hire enough workers, the average workweek has continued to climb. At 18.7, the index is at its highest level in a decade.

&gt; # Homebuilder Sentiment Holds Steady

&gt; Our new Constitution is now established, everything seems to promise it will be durable; but, in this world, nothing is certain except death and taxes,” Benjamin Franklin

&gt; The national average on a 30 year fixed rate mortgage currently sits around 3.06%, little changed over the past month. Homebuilder sentiment as measured by the NAHB Housing Market Index similarly went unchanged in May staying at 83. Although it has been six months since the record high of 90 without much of a push back up to those record levels, homebuilder sentiment continues to come in well above anything observed prior to the pandemic. Commentary from the NAHB noted that the strong reading on homebuilder confidence is thanks to the low housing inventories, low rates, and strong demand, despite the headwinds of rising costs. While that could have played into the small decline in traffic, future sales did tick higher.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-NAHB-HL.png))**
&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-NAHB-Table.png))**

&gt; Whereas the headline number was flat on the month, readings based on each region saw much more variety. By far the largest move was for the Northeast. Since running back up to the record high back in February, homebuilder sentiment in the Northeast has fallen for three straight months and is now at the lowest level since January. The decline in sentiment in the Northeast is relatively recent. Whereas the region tied its record high earlier this year, the other regions all peaked out in the fall. For the Midwest, the declines have kept coming with 3 point declines in each of the past three months alone. The West and South, on the other hand, have found some respite. The South has ticked higher by 2 points in back-to-back months as it reached the highest level since December. Meanwhile, the West was unchanged at 91 in May.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-NAHB-Region.png))**

&gt; As for homebuilder stocks, the iShares US Home Construction ETF (ITB) had been trading in overbought territory throughout most of the spring but in the past couple of weeks, it has come back down to Earth. Last Wednesday, ITB successfully tested its 50-DMA with a small bounce at the tail end of the week. So far today, it has turned lower alongside the broader market with a 1.35% decline. While that means Friday's close marks a lower high, for the time being, the uptrend is still intact.

&gt; # Increased Caution Across Sentiment Indicators

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has been holding up at its 50-DMA in the past week while more speculative areas of the market (i.e. crypto) have experienced wild swings. As a result, sentiment on the part of individual investors has not seen much of a move. The American Association of Individual Investors' weekly reading on bullish sentiment was little changed this week climbing half of one percentage point to 37%. Although that was not a large move in the past week, sentiment has taken a big hit over the past month having fallen from well above 50%. In spite of that big drop and even though sentiment is around the lowest levels of the past half-year, the current sentiment level is within one percentage point of the historical average. In other words, optimism is low versus recent history but is very much middling from a longer term perspective.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052021-AAII-Bull.png))**

&gt; Meanwhile, bearish sentiment fell 0.7 percentage points to 26.3%. Unlike bullish sentiment, that is a bit lower than the historical average of 30.5%

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052021-AAII-Bear.png))**

&gt; Those corresponding moves meant the bull-bear spread climbed to 10.7 from 9.5 the prior week. Excluding last week, that is still one of the lowest readings since February.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052021-AAII-Bull-Bear.png))**

&gt; Neutral sentiment has been the star of the show recently. The gain this week was tiny at only 0.2 percentage points, but nonetheless, it marked the fifth consecutive week in which neutral sentiment has risen. At 36.7%, it is now at the highest level since the second week of 2020.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052021-AAII-Neutral.png))**

&gt; The Investors Intelligence survey of equity newsletter writers took a less optimistic tone this week as bullish sentiment fell 4.1 percentage points to a ten-week low of 54.5%. Bearish sentiment was unchanged at the highest level since the end of March. The survey also questions respondents on whether or not they expect a correction. That reading rose 4.1 percentage points to 28.3% in the biggest one-week uptick since the last week of April when it rose 4.7 percentage points. That leaves the reading at the highest level since the week of March 10th. Before that, you would need to go back to September 23rd to find as high of a reading.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052021-II-Correction.png))**

&gt; Another sentiment reading that has taken an even more dramatically negative tone lately has been the National Association of Active Investment Managers Exposure Index. This index measures how exposed to equities managers are where readings of 200 would mean they are leveraged long, 100 would be fully invested long, 0 would be neutral, -100 is fully short, and -200 is leveraged short. This week saw the index fall another 2.65 points after a massive 40-point decline last week. That is the lowest level since last March and April of last year. Altogether, while sentiment still favors bulls, there has been a more cautious tone that has been reflected in managers reducing exposure to equities.

Remarkably, despite many individual companies pulling back steeply today, the three major indexes finished the day positive, driven by gains in financial stocks and stability in mega-caps. Growth stocks and more speculative plays have been hit hard by a combination of inflationary fears and recent suggestions by monetary officials that the interest rate should be raised. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed the day 0.81%, less than 1% below it’s record high. The Dow Jones (DIA) recorded a new intraday record while the Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 0.76%. Market participants continue to monitor commentary from monetary officials, ongoing earnings season, and new economic data, particularly the April Jobs Report set for release tomorrow morning.

After reclaiming the leadership in April as the best performing sector in the SPY, so far in May we have seen investors rotate out of big tech stocks and into financial stocks, with many big banks pushing all-time highs today. Market participants are worried that a suggested raise in interest would affect the already stretched valuation of some companies. Given the rally the market saw in April, some analysts are worried that positive catalysts for equities are getting harder to achieve and may be running out. The economy in the US is recovering faster than initially predicted by analysts, with this earnings season seeing 86% of companies in the S&amp;P 500 that have reported earnings  beat estimates, according to data from FactSet. 

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen suggested that interest rates may need to rise in the near-term to prevent the economy from overheating, with the recent economic data and corporate earnings showing economic activity recovering much faster than expected as effective distribution of the vaccine in the US allows states to gradually reopen. Yellen said, “It may be that interest rates will have to rise somewhat to make sure that our economy doesn't overheat, even though the additional spending is relatively small relative to the size of the economy. It could cause some very modest increases in interest rates to get that reallocation, but these are investments our economy needs to be competitive and to be productive. I think our economy will grow faster because of them."" In later remarks, she added that raising rates was not something she was predicting or recommending and that the decision ultimately rests with the Federal Reserve. She said, “Let me be clear, that’s not something I’m predicting or recommending. If anybody appreciates the independence of the Fed, I think that person is me.”

The Labor Department will release its April jobs report on Friday, which is expected to show a staggering nearly 1 million payrolls came back last month, accelerating March’s gain. As a reminder, in March, the Department of Labor reported nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 for the month while the unemployment rate fell to 6% (unemployment rate was 14.6% in April 2020). Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 675,000 and an unemployment rate of 6%.

**Highlights**

* Weekly unemployment claims fell to 498,000 last week—a new low since the Covid-19 pandemic began more than a year ago. The four-week average of initial claims is also at the lowest point since the pandemic began. Read more [here](https://www.wsj.com/articles/weekly-jobless-claims-coronavirus-05-06-2021-11620247798).
* The Bank of England upped their growth estimates for the economy of the UK, anticipating GDP will grow 7.25% in the country, up from its forecast for 5% growth in February. The BOE also now sees inflation averaging 2.5% in 2021, up from its prior forecast for 2%, but said the rise in price pressures will likely be ""temporary."" 
* NIO announced the company will expand into Norway, with the group’s first service and delivery center set to open in the capital Oslo in September.
* A lot of stocks pulled back despite posting better than expected earnings. The market is very narrow right now, with gains concentrated in the financials, energy, and mega-caps.
* IBM introduced what it says is the world's first 2-nanometer chip making technology. The technology could be as much as 45% faster than the mainstream 7-nanometer chips in many of today's laptops and phones and up to 75% more power efficient, the company said.

191,DELL,A Tree Hugging guide towards speculative long investing.,"Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. I wanted to provide a different perspective on investing that might entertain or help others. Nothing I say should be considered fact, but instead my opinion. There is no guarantee of returns, but I believe my method lowers the long term risk while maximizing on potential less volatile gains. I do not have any positions in these companies, but I intend to add some or all of these positions to my portfolio.        

My thesis is generated around the semiconductor meeting held by the White House. I believe the White House tipped their hand into which companies will be their preferred partners of the future. This article will provide a layout of which stocks may be considered attractive from a long term speculative point of view. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-09/white-house-to-host-over-a-dozen-companies-at-chips-meeting.          

Stellantis NV, General Motors, Cummins and Ford: old school American companies with a large number of employees and a large supply chain that relies on Ford and GM to remain in business. I believe they were invited to the meeting because of their relationship with Biden from the Obama administration. Gas for tronics 2.0?       

Alphabet: tech company that has government contracts. Can provide unique insight into current and future trends based on search history.           

Dell, HP, Medtronic: computer and medical equipment manufacturers. It’s interesting how Nvidia and AMD were left off the invite list.         

Micron, Taiwan Semiconductor, Samsung, Intel: semiconductor manufacturers. We all know about the chip shortage.       

AT&amp;T: possible link to 5g capabilities/access. I’m wondering who the government is going to give their grant money to for providing rural areas with affordable internet and broadband.         

Northrop Grumman: we all know about the b-21. I believe that is likely why they got the invite, but there is also the potential that they are developing the 6th gen fighter of choice for the military.

Stocks reversed on Monday, rising on Wednesday for the first day in three sessions, with small-caps leading the way after a terrible run of performance in April. Despite Netflix (NFLX) sharply missing earnings expectations in terms of new paid subscribers, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ), while the Dow Jones (DIA) and S&amp;P 500 (SPY) remain near record levels. 

After a recent spike this week, the CBOE Volatility Index sank back to near 52-week lows, a sign that investor risk appetite is increasing. The VIX is known as the ""investor fear gauge,"" because it reflects investors' best predictions of near-term market volatility or risk. In general, the VIX rises during times of financial stress and falls during good economic times. David Kostin, chief US equity strategist at Goldman Sachs said, “The S&amp;P 500 has reached new highs while volatility has sharply declined. Low volatility has outweighed low correlations among stocks, driving return dispersion back below the long-term average. As the U.S. moves beyond key macro events such as the 2020 election, the $1.9 trillion fiscal stimulus package, and peak economic activity, we expect three defining themes for markets will be tax reform, infrastructure, and pricing power.”

While Netflix (NFLX) sharply missed estimates, this earnings season has largely blown consensus estimates out of the water, with more than 81% of companies that have reported so far beating earnings expectations, according to a study by FactSet. However, despite the largely positive earnings, many stocks (apart from today) have failed to react positively to the news. It seems as more positive economic data is released in terms of consumer spending and unemployment, it takes more and more impressive results to convince investors to pile into the stock. This suggests there is froth in the markets given the sky-high valuation of some companies. 

White House chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said he believes the U.S. will likely resume use of the Johnson &amp; Johnson Covid-19 vaccine as soon as Friday with a warning or restriction attached. The doctor said, “My estimate is that we will continue to use it in some form. I doubt very seriously if they just cancel it. I don’t think that’s going to happen. I do think that there will likely be some sort of warning or restriction or risk assessment. I don’t think it’s just going to go back and say, ‘Okay, everything’s fine. Go right back.’ I think it’ll likely say, ‘Okay, we’re going to use it, but be careful under these certain circumstances.”

**Highlights**

* The White House announced more than 200 million doses of the coronavirus vaccine have been distributed in the US, greatly surpassing original estimates of 100 million doses delivered in the first 100 days of Biden’s presidency. On the back of this robust distribution, all states are beginning to open back up.
* Mortgage applications jumped 8.6% in the week ended April 16, marking the biggest jump since late January as mortgage rates pulled back following a surge, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA). 
* Ford Motor (F) is planning more downtime at five North American factories due to a global semiconductor shortage. 
* During yesterday’s virtual event, Apple (AAPL) announced a new slate of products set to include the companies own chip. The offering includes a new iMac, a new iPad, and a new tracking-device called Airtags.
* Gisele Bündchen, supermodel and Tom Brady’s wife was announced as a special advisor for the CEO and board of directors in DraftKings. This is just the latest in a series of high-profile moves by DraftKings to establish itself as the premier sport-betting company. 
* After gapping up after earnings, Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) joined the ranks of healthcare companies worth $100 billion or more
* After a series of high profile accidents including small children, the US Consumer Product Safety Commission advised consumer to not buy the treadmill if there are small kids or pets at home.This could affect the company's product-safety profile, a material category for the household and personal-goods sector. In response, Peloton (PTON) called the statements “inaccurate and misleading” and refused calls to recall their treadmill. The stock has been in freefall this week.

Stocks fell on Monday, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) retreating from record levels with the benchmark Treasury yield climbing and market participants taking profits off the table after the recent record run. Looking ahead, market participants will be closely monitoring earnings season, with many more notable companies reporting this week. 

Last week, the US reported great economic data that fuelled the current rally. According to a report by the US Department of Commerce, retail sales boomed 9.8% higher in the month of March as the economy continues to gradually reopen as more vaccines are distributed. Moreover, the Weekly Unemployment report showed first-time unemployment claims plunged far below analyst estimates. The Labor Department reported 576,000 new jobless claims for the week ending April 10. This represents the lowest total first-time unemployment claims filed since August 2020 and a sharp decline from both the previous week’s total of 769,000 and analyst expectations of 710,000. 

After a very choppy first quarter to the year, volatility has subsided considerably in recent sessions. Despite a small spike today, the CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, remains near-14 month lows as equities continue higher. The VIX is known as the ""investor fear gauge,"" because it reflects investors' best predictions of near-term market volatility or risk. In general, the VIX rises during times of financial stress and falls during good economic times. It is a way to gauge the risk appetite of market participants.

Distribution of the Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) coronavirus vaccine remains paused in the US following reports of rare blood clots in people who received the vaccine. The agencies are reviewing data over six reported U.S. cases of a severe blood clot in individuals after receiving the vaccine, and have recommended the pause ""out of an abundance of caution,"" the FDA said in a Twitter post. To date, roughly 6.8 million doses of the single-dose JNJ vaccine have been administered.

Stocks jumped on Thursday, with all three major indexes reaching fresh intraday records as market participants digested a much better-than-expected unemployment report and a sharp increase in consumer spending. The S&amp;P 500 is up roughly 5% in the month of April, led primarily by mega-cap technology and financial stocks. 

Today, the economic data released was very promising. According to a report by the US Department of Commerce, retail sales boomed 9.8% higher in the month of March as the economy continues to gradually reopen as more vaccines are distributed. Moreover, the Weekly Unemployment report showed first-time unemployment claims plunged far below analyst estimates. The Labor Department reported 576,000 new jobless claims for the week ending April 10. This represents the lowest total first-time unemployment claims filed since August 2020 and a sharp decline from both the previous week’s total of 769,000 and analyst expectations of 710,000. 

This is great news on two fronts. First, consumer spending represents 70% of US GDP ([more info here](https://www.thebalance.com/components-of-gdp-explanation-formula-and-chart-3306015#:~:text=Consumer%20spending%20comprises%2070%25%20of,components%20of%20the%20U.S.%20economy.)) and is a key driver of economic growth. GDP is now expected to increase 6.5% in 2021 according to the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's monetary policy-making group. That is sharply higher than the 4.2% forecast made in December of 2020. Second, Jerome Powell and other FOMC members have reiterated that recovery in the labor market “remains uneven and far from complete”. To see a report blow so far past analyst expectation is a great sign the labor market is recovering in tandem with the surge in consumer spending. 

Michael Pearce, senior US economist for Capital Economics said of the consumer report, “What caught our eye was the 13.4% surge in spending on food and drink services, while clothing store sales were up by 18.1%. Relative to pre-pandemic levels, food and drink services sales are down just 5.1%, while clothing store sales are now higher than they were in February 2020. That suggests a combination of loosening restrictions and easing of virus fears linked to the vaccine rollout are driving a rapid return to normalcy.” 

Distribution of the Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) coronavirus vaccine remains paused in the US following reports of rare blood clots in people who received the vaccine. The agencies are reviewing data over six reported U.S. cases of a severe blood clot in individuals after receiving the vaccine, and have recommended the pause ""out of an abundance of caution,"" the FDA said in a Twitter post. To date, roughly 6.8 million doses of the single-dose JNJ vaccine have been administered. 

In a statement, JNJ said it has been “working closely with medical experts and health authorities, and we strongly support the open communication of this information to healthcare professionals and the public” and added “In addition, we have been reviewing these cases with European health authorities. We have made the decision to proactively delay the rollout of our vaccine in Europe.” During a press briefing, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the J&amp;J vaccine review would likely take “days to weeks, rather than weeks to months”, in order to resolve.” Despite the setback with JNJ, distribution of the vaccine remains strong in the US, with the CDC reporting more than 3 million doses being distributed per day.

Stocks traded mixed on Wednesday, with the Dow Jones rallying to intraday highs while the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) pulled back. Market participants digested a slew of corporate earnings reports from big banks in the US and remarks from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell

Earnings kicked off this morning with several banks reporting first-quarter earnings. JPMorgan (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Wells Fargo (WFC)blew past analyst expectations, driven by lower loan losses, robust trading and investment banking revenue. Expectations for a strong profit rebound have helped financial stocks and the equity markets rally but have also set a high bar for companies to clear. 

Wall Street analysts are expecting a surge in corporate profits in tandem with the recovering economy, with the reopening of the economy and a rise in consumer spending set to boost companies’ results. Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at LPL Financial said, “We could see upwards of 30% year-over-year earnings growth in the first quarter. That would be the most we’ve seen since coming out of the financial crisis. Expectations are for about 25% earnings growth in the first quarter. And let’s not forget in the previous two quarters what happened: massive, massive beats.”

Jerome Powell reiterated that a near-term move on interest rates remains unlikely until economic recovery, and particularly the labor market, are able to build up momentum and said the Central Bank would slow the pace of its bond purchase program “well before” raising interest rates. Powell said, “We will taper asset purchases when we’ve made substantial further progress toward our goals from last December when we announced that guidance. That would in all likelihood be well before the time we consider raising rates.”

Looking ahead, market participants will closely monitor the report of March retail sales set to be released tomorrow. March retail sales are expected to be strong, with stimulus checks making their way into the economy and the economy gradually reopening due to effective distribution of the vaccine. Economists expect March retail sales to rise a consensus 6.1%, or 5.3% excluding autos, according to Dow Jones. That compares to a sales decline of 3% in February

Stocks were mostly higher Thursday, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) leading the way, as market participants await the beginning of first-quarter earnings season and digest comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.

After a choppy first quarter to the year, the Dow Jones (DIA) and S&amp;P 500 (SPY) largely recovered in the first week of Q2 and continue to hover near record highs. The equity market got a boost after FOMC members signaled in their March meeting that the Fed continues to favor maintaining highly accommodative monetary policies for the foreseeable future and signaling they will hold off on tightening policy at the first sights of inflation. Jeffrey  Kleintop, chief global investment strategist at Charles Schwab said, “A big part of this is making sure the vaccine-led recovery is firmly rooted, and that won't be clear until somewhere in the second half of this year. So it's possible that as we look out to the late summer timeframe or early fall that that's something that we could consider at that point. But until then, there's still a lot of risks. and just to backtrack it, we know that monetary policy works with a lag, and so it makes more sense to ensure that we're on solid footing before you begin to take your foot off the pedal."" 

Furthermore, Speaking at a virtual meeting at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell highlighted the uneven recovery in the US labor market as a sign the economic recovery still has a ways to go in order to meet the Federal Reserve’s employment goals. He said “The recovery though here remains uneven and incomplete. Tee burden is still falling on lower-income workers. The unemployment rate in the bottom quartile is still 20%. There are still eight and a half million people out of work. This unevenness that we’re talking about is a very serious issue.” 

Looking ahead, market participants will be closely monitoring the upcoming earnings season for the first three months (Q1) of 2021. Over the past several weeks, analysts have raised their earnings estimates by record levels with the expectation that recent economic growth will drive corporate earnings higher. According to FactSet, first-quarter [earnings estimates were increased by a record margin of 6%](https://insight.factset.com/record-high-increase-in-sp-500-eps-estimates-for-q1) over the past several weeks, as analysts adjusted their forecasts for the much stronger-than-expected economic rebound seen so far. Omar Aguilar, chief investment officer at Charles Schwab said, “We’re still in probably the early parts of the expansionary cyclical after recovering from that recession. We’ve started to see cyclical trades playing a big role in the early part of the cycle. Normally what happens at this stage is you continue to see … the cyclical component will continue to drive leadership into the second part of this year into next year.”

36,DELL,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, April 8, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, April 8, 2021**

Stocks were mostly higher Thursday, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) leading the way, as market participants await the beginning of first-quarter earnings season and digest comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.

After a choppy first quarter to the year, the Dow Jones (DIA) and S&amp;P 500 (SPY) largely recovered in the first week of Q2 and continue to hover near record highs. The equity market got a boost after FOMC members signaled in their March meeting that the Fed continues to favor maintaining highly accommodative monetary policies for the foreseeable future and signaling they will hold off on tightening policy at the first sights of inflation. Jeffrey  Kleintop, chief global investment strategist at Charles Schwab said, “A big part of this is making sure the vaccine-led recovery is firmly rooted, and that won't be clear until somewhere in the second half of this year. So it's possible that as we look out to the late summer timeframe or early fall that that's something that we could consider at that point. But until then, there's still a lot of risks. and just to backtrack it, we know that monetary policy works with a lag, and so it makes more sense to ensure that we're on solid footing before you begin to take your foot off the pedal."" 

Furthermore, Speaking at a virtual meeting at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell highlighted the uneven recovery in the US labor market as a sign the economic recovery still has a ways to go in order to meet the Federal Reserve’s employment goals. He said “The recovery though here remains uneven and incomplete. Tee burden is still falling on lower-income workers. The unemployment rate in the bottom quartile is still 20%. There are still eight and a half million people out of work. This unevenness that we’re talking about is a very serious issue.” 

Looking ahead, market participants will be closely monitoring the upcoming earnings season for the first three months (Q1) of 2021. Over the past several weeks, analysts have raised their earnings estimates by record levels with the expectation that recent economic growth will drive corporate earnings higher. According to FactSet, first-quarter [earnings estimates were increased by a record margin of 6%](https://insight.factset.com/record-high-increase-in-sp-500-eps-estimates-for-q1) over the past several weeks, as analysts adjusted their forecasts for the much stronger-than-expected economic rebound seen so far. Omar Aguilar, chief investment officer at Charles Schwab said, “We’re still in probably the early parts of the expansionary cyclical after recovering from that recession. We’ve started to see cyclical trades playing a big role in the early part of the cycle. Normally what happens at this stage is you continue to see … the cyclical component will continue to drive leadership into the second part of this year into next year.”

192,DELL,CHIP SHORTTAGE - REAL OR MEMOREX," 

I imported SIMM (Single Inline Memory Modules), between 1994 and 2006, for my branded computers.

In that time period, I watched the ""chip"" market more than I did the precious metals market - they moved daily and prices for each type of module was set by noon, each day.

My companies imported tens of thousands of SIMMs from Singapore, Taiwan, China, Spain, and a few other countries. The paperwork required at customs, in Anchorage, was due to an ""Anti Dumping Tax"". This was to prevent North Korean manufactured chips to be imported (as it should be). At the time, Goldstar became a producer of IC (Integrated Circuitry), chips as it could not keep up with the television innovations. BUT... Goldstar was a SOUTH Korean company, with no embargo, yet monitored closely. Thy produced a great product, however, they were also counterfeited easier and therefore, ""a radioactive"" product.

&gt;***Side Note:***

LG Semicon LLC, was a producer, specializing in IC chips. One company bought the other and both Goldstar and LG Semicon became what we now know as LG.

Back in those days tracking the manufacturing of chips was crucial (no pun intended), because of the daily swing of the prices. The determining factors (which I looked at), were :

* Production capacity of each factory.
* Daily production numbers of computers.
* Intel ($INTC), AMD, ($AMD), Microsoft ($MSFT), Compaq, HP ($HP - Hewlett Packard, at one time, ""absorbed"" Packard Bell Computers), and other mass consumers/assemblers of IC chips for PCBs (Printed Circuit Board), including details of motherboard designs and IC requirements.
* Mother Nature and her wrath ""overseas"".

The computer makers, DELL ($DELL), Gateway, and Compaq always had first choice of available chips, due to their deep pockets and demand.

A few companies in Asian countries figured out that by closing a factory, for a day or a week, they could, effectively, increase their profits quickly. This effected the entire ""Technology Sector"", although it did not exist yet.

&gt;**Points:**

* Always ask ""Why"".
* ""Due Diligence"" is not just 2 levels deep. Sometimes you have to find out who is selling the sand/silica, first.
* In this market, ""What goes down, usually comes up"". Write that down.

Stocks rose on Wednesday, with each of the three major indices closing the day positive. Shares of technology companies, which were hit the hardest by the pullback, shook earlier losses, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) closing 0.82% higher. 

In the past week, the rotation from high-flying growth stocks into cyclical and value investments picked up steam as fears of higher Treasury yields pressured stocks across the board this week, with higher prices and increased borrowing costs for companies seen as an emerging threat for high valuation companies. 

During his semiannual testimony on monetary policy, Chair of the Federal Reserve Jerome Powell said that rising Treasury yields are, “a statement of confidence on the part of markets that we’ll have a robust and ultimately complete recovery”. As a reminder, Treasury yields are the total amount of money you earn by owning U.S. Treasury bills, notes, bonds or inflation-protected securities. The U.S. Department of the Treasury sells them to pay for the US debt and when the timeframe of the note expires, the government pays back the face value plus states interest. Essentially, Powell is saying that Treasury yields are going up because investors believe in the US’ ability to pay back the interest of those yields when the time expires, which implies the economy will recover.

In his remarks, Powell reaffirmed that the Federal Reserve was looking to maintain its current accommodative policy posturing for the time being, keeping benchmark rates near zero and asset purchases at the current pace of $120 billion per month. He said, ""The economy is a long way from our employment and inflation goals, and it is likely to take some time for substantial further progress to be achieved. We will continue to clearly communicate our assessment of progress toward our goals well in advance of any change in the pace of purchases."" Supportive monetary policy from the Federal Reserve is one of the reasons we think the factors are in place for a sustained bull market even after the pandemic is over. While there are certainly short-term headwinds in the market, our long-term outlook remains bullish.

* Incredible, in the last few hours of the market, “meme stocks” like AMC and Gamestop (GME) gapped up strongly. Including after-hours movement, GME is up more than 120% on the day at the time of writing. This really is Psycho!!
* President Joe Biden will sign an executive order on Wednesday aimed at addressing a global semiconductor chip shortage that has forced U.S. automakers and other manufacturers to cut production. The order will launch a 100-day review of supply chains for four critical products: semiconductor chips, large-capacity batteries for electric vehicles, rare earth minerals, and pharmaceuticals.
* After the recent pullback in Tesla (TSLA), Cathie Woods, portfolio manager at ARK Investments, upped the bet on Tesla by $121 million in her ETF ARKK, the top-performing ETF of last year. We’re huge fans of Cathie Woods here at PsychoTrader, we pay attention when she does something. We think you should as well.

98,DELL,[Naked Short Selling / FTD's] Dole Food Had Too Many Shares (2013 - article written in 2017)," Just one of many tales of how the sausage is ***really*** made on Wall St. It is outrageous that examples such as this are occurring every single day, right before our eyes (well... maybe not in plain sight)

Quite a long read - but is a rare glimpse behind the curtain. Sick, really. (source: [https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2017-02-17/dole-food-had-too-many-shares](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2017-02-17/dole-food-had-too-many-shares) )

# Dole Food Had Too Many Shares

It's enough to make you wish for a blockchain.      

 By 

[Matt Levine](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/authors/ARbTQlRLRjE/matthew-s-levine) 

February 17, 2017, 7:00 a.m. PST 

 

In 2013, tropical-fruit tycoon David Murdock, who was the chairman,  chief executive officer and biggest shareholder of Dole Food Co., took  it private for $13.50 a share. A lot of shareholders felt that that  price was way too low, and that Murdock had sandbagged the shareholders  by driving down the value of the company so he could buy it cheaply for  himself. So they sued, [and they won](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2015-08-27/dole-s-ceo-got-himself-too-sweet-a-deal#footnote-1440705271545).  In 2015, the Delaware Chancery Court ordered Murdock to pay  shareholders another $2.74 a share, plus interest. There was a class  action on behalf of shareholders, covering 36,793,758 shares, and after  the court ruled in their favor, the class lawyers informed the  shareholders and asked them to submit a form to claim their $2.74 a  share.             [1             ](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2017-02-17/dole-food-had-too-many-shares#footnote-1487284943950) 

They  got back claims from 4,662 shareholders for a total of 49,164,415  shares. ""That figure substantially exceeded the 36,793,758 shares in the  class,"" Delaware Vice Chancellor Travis Laster [drily noted](http://courts.delaware.gov/Opinions/Download.aspx?id=252690) in an opinion Wednesday. Oops! Somehow shareholders owned 33 percent more Dole Food shares than there were Dole Food shares.

Huh. So. The simple explanation would be ""a quarter of those people were lying,"" but nope. Almost all the claims were valid,             [2             ](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2017-02-17/dole-food-had-too-many-shares#footnote-1487270348287) or at least, ""facially eligible."" So the lawyers sheepishly  went back to Vice Chancellor Laster to explain what happened and ask  what to do about it.

What happened? Two things. The first one is just a pure pointless mess. Essentially the way everyone owns stock is:

1. Cede &amp; Co., a nominee of the Depository Trust Co., owns all the stock in all the companies.
2. DTC keeps a list of its ""participants"" -- banks and brokers -- who ""really"" own that stock, and how much each of them own.
3. The participants, in turn, keep lists of ""beneficial owners"" -- people and funds -- who *really* really own the stock, and how much each of them own.

 

So if you own stock, what you really have is an entry in your  broker's database, and your broker in turn has an entry in DTC's  database, and DTC (well, Cede) has an entry in the company's database of  shareholders of record. If you sell the stock, your broker takes it out  of your account (at your broker), and DTC takes it out of your broker's  account (at DTC), and DTC adds it to the buyer's broker's account (at  DTC), and the buyer's broker adds it to the buyer's account (at the  buyer's broker). As far as the company is concerned, Cede owned the  stock the whole time.

If this all makes your head hurt, you are not  alone. Sometimes it makes DTC's head hurt too, and it needs to lie down  for a while in a dark room and listen to soothing music. DTC calls this a  ""chill."" I am not kidding.             [3             ](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2017-02-17/dole-food-had-too-many-shares#footnote-1487275841665) So when there's a merger that's about to close, it's too crazy  for DTC to both keep track of trades and deal with getting the merger  payment to shareholders. So DTC [will place a chill on the stock](https://www.dtcclearning.com/products-and-services/asset-services/issuer-services/how-issuers-work-with-dtcc-faqs/3500-what-does-it-mean-when-a-security-is-chilled-at-dtc.html), and just not record trades for the three days leading up to the closing. From Wednesday's opinion             [4             ](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2017-02-17/dole-food-had-too-many-shares#footnote-1487276404071):

&gt;DTC placed “chills” on its records for its  participants’ positions in Dole common stock as of the close of business  on November 1. A “chill” restricts a participant’s ability to deposit  or withdraw the security. Once DTC initiated the chills, the  participants’ positions in Dole common stock were locked in and could  not change.

Nov. 1, 2013, was the closing date,             [5             ](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2017-02-17/dole-food-had-too-many-shares#footnote-1487276355252)but the chill effectively covered the three previous days:

&gt;DTC’s  centralized ledger did not reflect all of the trades in Dole common  stock on the day of the merger or during the two days preceding it.  Under the current standard of T+3 for clearing trades, DTC did not  receive information about all of the transactions that took place on  October 30, October 31, or November 1. 

This doesn't  actually mean that you couldn't trade Dole stock in the three days  leading up to the merger closing. You could, and lots of people did.  About 32 million shares traded in those last three days.             [6             ](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2017-02-17/dole-food-had-too-many-shares#footnote-1487277111665)It just means that DTC doesn't want to hear about it. DTC was chilling. Instead:

&gt;The  DTC participants who facilitated transactions that had not yet cleared  when the merger closed were responsible for properly allocating the  merger consideration among the parties to the transactions.

As  far as DTC was concerned, whoever owned shares as of the close on Oct.  29 owned the shares at the time the merger closed. If you sold your  shares after that time, your broker and the buyer's broker -- the DTC  participants -- had to sort that out themselves.

You can see why this would be a problem for the current Dole  lawsuit. If you owned a share of Dole stock as of Oct. 30, DTC thinks  you owned it at closing. If you sold the share to me on Oct. 31, my  broker (and your broker) thinks that I owned it at closing. It's just  one share, but it has turned into two shares as far as ""facially  eligible"" claims go.             [7             ](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2017-02-17/dole-food-had-too-many-shares#footnote-1487278402693)This is a weird problem: If you owned the stock on Oct. 30, and  then sold it before the closing, you're kind of a jerk for submitting a  claim pretending that you owned the stock at closing.             [8             ](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2017-02-17/dole-food-had-too-many-shares#footnote-1487277720744) But this all happened a pretty long time ago and maybe you forgot.

Fortunately  this problem is solvable. The solution is simultaneously trivial and  extremely difficult. The key thing to realize is that those trades in  the last three days happened, and somehow the original merger  consideration -- the $13.50 a share paid on Nov. 4, 2013 -- found its  way to the people who really owned the stock at the end of Nov. 1. DTC  might not have had a complete and up-to-date list of them, but DTC's  participants had mechanisms to get the money to the right place.  (Intuitively: If Broker A sold shares to Broker B on Oct. 31, DTC would  send the merger money to Broker A on Nov. 4, and Broker A would pass it  along to Broker B, etc.) Whatever voodoo they did back then, they could  probably do again. The problem of distributing the $2.74 can be reduced  to a previously solved problem, the problem of distributing the $13.50.  So it is trivial.

It's also kind of hard, in that the brokers have  to go back and figure out who actually owned the shares at the time,  but that's their problem. The Delaware vice chancellor concludes that  for *him* to figure out who actually owned the shares, or for the *lawyers* to  figure it out, ""would be lengthy, arduous, cumbersome, expensive, and  fundamentally uncertain,"" and ""functionally impossible"" to do ""in a  practical or cost-effective manner."" That sounds hard! So the lawyers  suggested, and the judge approved, letting the brokers figure it out  instead:

&gt;Under this method, it will be up to the DTC  participants and their client institutions to resolve in the first  instance any issues over who should receive the settlement  consideration. Shifting the burden to them is efficient because they  already had to address these issues for purposes of allocating the  merger consideration. If new issues arise, the DTC participants and  their client institutions have access to their own records, and they  have visibility into the terms of their contractual relationships, such  as the terms on which shares are borrowed. Any ensuing disputes are  between the beneficial owners and their custodial banks and brokers.  Those disputes should be resolved pursuant to the contractual mechanisms  in the governing agreements or, if necessary, through a judicial  proceeding limited to the parties.

There might be lots of issues, but they won't be the court's problem. Good solution.

But there is another problem that created extra Dole shares.  This is also a mess, but not a pointless one. It's a real economic  issue, and also one that people seem to get emotional about. It is:  short-selling.

Some quick background. The way short-selling works is:

1. Mr. A owns a share of stock.
2. Mr. B borrows Mr. A's share of stock.
3. Mr. B sells the share to Mr. C.

But now Mr. A and Mr. C *each own one share of stock*. Where  there was only one share, now there are two. A ""phantom share"" has been  created. Well, not really. The trick to balancing the books is to  remember that Mr. B owes Mr. A a share of stock. So Mr. B now owns *negative one share of stock*.  There's a total of one share: one for A, and one for C, and negative  one for B. One plus one minus one is one. It's no problem.             [9             ](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2017-02-17/dole-food-had-too-many-shares#footnote-1487278747394) 

""But what if ...,"" you start to ask, and I reply: Shh,  shh. It just works. What if the company pays a dividend? Well, Mr C.  physically possesses the share -- don't think too hard about that  metaphor -- so the company pays the dividend to Mr. C. But Mr. A also  owns the share, and he wants the dividend too. But it's OK, because Mr. B  owns negative one share, so he has to *pay* a dividend. So he pays the dividend to Mr. A.             [10             ](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2017-02-17/dole-food-had-too-many-shares#footnote-1487278981700)In practice, this is all intermediated through brokers, and Mr.  A is unlikely to ever find out that his share was borrowed or that he  got his dividend from Mr. B. For Mr. A, the whole thing just works  quietly and seamlessly. It's magic.

What if the company is acquired in a management buyout for  $13.50 in cash? Same thing. The company sends $13.50 to Mr. C. Mr. B  sends the $13.50 to Mr. A. The two owners of the one share of stock each  get the full $13.50 merger price for that one share of stock. Mr. B,  who is short one share of stock, pays one merger price. Everything  works.             [11             ](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2017-02-17/dole-food-had-too-many-shares#footnote-1487279329554) It just works. It's still magic.

What if the company is  acquired in a management buyout for $13.50 in cash and then, three years  later, a court adds another $2.74 in cash to the merger price? Same ...  wait. I have no idea. The magic might break down here. As the court  points out:

&gt;The shorting resulted in additional  beneficial owners who received the merger consideration, who fell within  the technical language of the class definition, and who could claim the  settlement consideration. Meanwhile, the lenders of the shares, not  knowing that the shares were lent, also could claim the settlement  consideration. This is another means by which two different claimants  could submit facially valid claims for the same underlying shares.

That's  basically true of the original merger consideration, too. There,  brokers would owe merger consideration to people who owned more shares  than actually existed, and they'd go get that extra consideration from  the short sellers. Everything balanced out. Maybe that will happen here  too. But it's harder. If you were short Dole Food stock on Nov. 1, 2013,  you were doing it in an account with a broker. You posted collateral in  that account. When it came time to collect the $13.50 from you, the  broker had no problem collecting it. But that was three years ago. If  the broker comes back to you now for the extra $2.74, you might feel  entirely within your rights to reply ""new phone who dis?"" You might not  have an account with that broker any more. You might not even exist any  more. (People die; hedge funds close.) You certainly haven't been  posting collateral against your Dole Food short position for the last  three years. That position was closed out ages ago.

Anyway this could account for millions of the phantom shares:

&gt;As  of October 31, 2013, traders had shorted approximately 2.9 million  shares of Dole common stock. Because the price of Dole common stock  traded above the merger price through closing, it is likely that traders  shorted additional shares on November 1, resulting in even more shares  in short positions as of closing.

So that's a fun  one! I don't know how the brokers will deal with this problem, but I  will just quote the court and say: ""Any ensuing disputes are between the  beneficial owners and their custodial banks and brokers."" Let us wash  our hands of them.

Isn't this such a delightful muck? As Vice Chancellor Laster writes:

&gt;This  problem is an unintended consequence of the top-down federal solution  to the paperwork crisis that threatened Wall Street in the 1970s.  Through the policy of share immobilization, Congress and the Securities  and Exchange Commission addressed the crisis using the 1970s-era  technologies of depository institutions, jumbo paper certificates, and a  centralized ledger.

It's enough to drive even a sensible vice chancellor to talk about blockchains             [12             ](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2017-02-17/dole-food-had-too-many-shares#footnote-1487282812721):

&gt;Distributed ledger technology offers a  potential technological solution by maintaining multiple, current copies  of a single and comprehensive stock ownership ledger. The State of  Delaware has announced its support for distributed ledger initiatives.

I want to push back on that a *little*.  There are two problems in this case. One is mechanical: figuring out  who actually owned Dole stock as of the closing date three years ago. A  blockchain would presumably solve that problem, without requiring the  court and the lawyers to embark on a ""lengthy, arduous, cumbersome,  expensive, and fundamentally uncertain"" dive through the records to  figure out who owns what. But the current system *also* solves  the problem, without requiring the court and the lawyers to do anything  arduous or expensive. They just send the problem off to the current  ledgering system -- DTC and the custodian brokers and so forth -- and  that system deals with it. It's like a blockchain, only it's made up of  hundreds of humans and computer systems at dozens of banks, glued  together in a way that somehow more or less works. It's not even  expensive. ""DTC advised class counsel that this process is feasible and  requires payment of a base fee to DTC of $2,250, with the potential for  additional consultation fees if difficulties arise.""             [13             ](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2017-02-17/dole-food-had-too-many-shares#footnote-1487283633830) That's like 0.002 percent of the amount being distributed. It  does seem like a half-competent blockchain would be faster and cheaper  and more transparent. But the idea that the current system can't solve  this problem is wrong. The current system can solve it fine. Just not in  a way that any individual human can see or understand. The solution is,  let's say, distributed.

The other problem is economic: People owned more Dole shares  than actually existed, because they bought them from short sellers, and  now if you want to pay off all the owners, you have to track down the  short sellers to make them pay up. That problem is hard, and it seems  like the current system might have real problems with it: If the short  sellers died, or went out of business, or closed their accounts, or just  really don't want to pay some extra merger consideration three years  after the fact and yell a lot when their brokers ask them to, then the  brokers will have a hard time finding all the money. Would a blockchain  fix this? I don't know. A blockchain would make it easy to *identify* the  short sellers, three years later. (That's what blockchain immutability  is good for.) But then what? They could still have died, or closed their  accounts, or yell.

But, sure, Delaware, and Vice Chancellor Laster, are not *wrong* that a distributed ledger system to keep track of who owns what shares in real time would make all of this a lot easier.             [14             ](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2017-02-17/dole-food-had-too-many-shares#footnote-1487285941575)And I can see why Delaware is thinking about it. This is not  the first time we have talked about the antique goofiness of the current  system, and how it messes with mergers. Dell Inc. also did a management  buyout, and a Delaware court [also found](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-06-01/michael-dell-bought-his-company-too-cheaply)  that its shareholders should have gotten paid more. But some of those  shareholders who should have gotten paid more didn't, because of two  separate failures to grapple with the convoluted registry system. (Some  of them failed to [own](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2015-07-14/banks-forgot-who-was-supposed-to-own-dell-shares) their shares the right way. Others failed to [vote](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-05-13/t-rowe-price-voted-for-the-dell-buyout-by-accident)  them the right way. Neither was entirely the investors' fault.) That  system has worked pretty well for 40 years. But it is starting to show  its age. There are little cracks that give us brief glimpses of the  abyss below. Why not cover them up with a fresh, cool coat of  blockchain?

&amp;#x200B;

1. I'm eliding some details here. The [2015 decision](http://courts.delaware.gov/opinions/download.aspx?ID=228790)  combined class action and appraisal claims for a class including all of  the Dole shareholders other than Murdock and his affiliates. That was a  total of about 54.1 million shares. ""This decision likely renders the  appraisal proceeding moot,"" the vice-chancellor found then. But the  subsequent class-action [settlement](https://www.law360.com/articles/757510/dole-food-gets-nod-for-148m-merger-suit-settlement)  excluded the appraisal claimants, who had their own lawyers and took  care of themselves separately. They had about 17.3 million shares. The  other 36.8 million shares, covered by the class action, are what we're  talking about here. Their payout comes to about $115.8 million,  including interest (but before deducting attorneys' fees).

2. They did kick out 48,758 shares after double-checking.

[ ](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2017-02-17/dole-food-had-too-many-shares#footnote-1487277111665-ref) 
7. From the opinion:  
For purpose of  the settlement, multiple owners could submit claims for shares involved  in trades that had not cleared. A DTC participant who continued to hold  the shares as reflected on DTC’s records could submit a claim, but so  could the beneficial owner who was a client of the DTC participant that  acquired the shares and therefore owned them as of closing. Both claims  could appear facially valid even though they involved the same  underlying shares.  
[ ](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2017-02-17/dole-food-had-too-many-shares#footnote-1487278402693-ref) 
8. Though I mean I see your point. Murdock paid $13.50  in cash in the merger; the court ultimately found that he should have  paid $16.24. If I owned the stock at the closing, I got $13.50, and am  now entitled to get the extra $2.74. But if I bought it from you the day  before the closing, I paid you about $13.55 (the closing price on Oct.  31). The extra $2.74 (or $2.69) is kind of a windfall to me. **You**,  on the other hand, might have been a long-term shareholder who thought  Dole was destined for great things, who voted against the underpriced  merger, and who finally sold in disgust the day before it closed. In a  real sense Murdock's underpayment harmed you, not me.   
But,  whatever, the deal is that the people who owned stock at closing are the  ones who get the extra payment. And to be fair that was priced in: The  stock closed at $13.55 the day before the merger closed, and a whopping  $13.65 the Friday of the closing. And then the next Monday all those  buyers got cashed out for $13.50, as they knew they would be. Presumably  they only paid over the merger price because they thought they might  get a second chance in court.

9. People sometimes complain about ""naked short selling""  creating ""phantom shares,"" which they demonstrate by pointing to the  fact that people own more shares of Company XYZ than there are shares  outstanding. But this is no problem at all, is true of every company,   and has nothing to do with naked short selling. ""Naked"" short selling  means selling stock short without borrowing it. That is mostly illegal.  It would indeed create ""phantom shares."" But so does regular, clothed  short selling. Either way, the trick is that the person doing the short  selling -- naked or otherwise -- now owns a negative number of shares,  which precisely balances out the ""phantom shares"" that the short selling  creates.  
[ ](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2017-02-17/dole-food-had-too-many-shares#footnote-1487278747394-ref) 
10. This is covered by Section 8 of the [Master Securities Loan Agreement](http://www.sifma.org/services/standard-forms-and-documentation/mra,-gmra,-msla-and-msftas/). But for our purposes let's just pretend it happens by the operation of magic.  
[ ](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2017-02-17/dole-food-had-too-many-shares#footnote-1487278981700-ref) 
11. This also seems to be covered by Section 8 of the MSLA, though ... less clearly? Everyone seems to think it works, though.  
Again this all happens through DTC, brokers, etc. Like realistically what happens is:  

   1. There are like 1000 shares outstanding.
   2. The company pays $13,500 to Cede &amp; Co.
   3. DTC looks at its books and sees that Broker X owns 100 shares.
   4. Cede pays $1,350 to Broker X.
   5. Broker X looks at its books and sees that it has customers who own 150 shares, and other customers who are short 50 shares.
   6. Broker X bills those short customers for $675.
   7. Broker X takes that $675 from the shorts, and the $1,350 from Cede, and gives it to the long customers.
   8. Everything checks out.
12. Albeit in a footnote.

14. To be fair, a *centralized* ledger to keep  track of who owns what shares in real time would help a lot. Half of the  problem here would go away if DTC just chilled out with the ""chills""  before mergers. (The move to [T+2 settlement](http://dodd-frank.com/sec-approves-t2-settlement-abides-by-t4-settlement-for-firm-commitment-deals/) will help a little.) The key thing is *updating the share registry in real time*, not distributing it.

116,DELL,Advanced Micro Devices DD,"**TLDR: AMD has gained market share in every sector and is the market leader in Desktop CPU’s. Lisa Su can do no wrong. They will keep growing while Intel is stagnating for a least 2 years waiting on 7 nm processors. Nvidia is a monster and I hope the EU crushes their ARM deal. AMD is in a really good place to dominate the Desktop CPU sector, gain significant market share in laptops and servers, and take points off of Nvidia in GPU’s. AMD to $120 I think \*shrug**

Hey everyone! I’m just a college student who got bored and wanted to find the fastest way to through away my loans. GME afforded me that opportunity, so now I’m going to try my hand at making money. Or at least analysis. I’ve been following AMD since they released Ryzen Gen 2. Intel had been sitting comfortable in the throne, barely improving chips (how long did they use 10 nm nodes lol?) each generation and hoarding cash because they didn’t have a competitor. Ryzen 2 changed that, Ryzen 3 made AMD the market leader, and I believe Ryzen 4 will solidify it. The difference is even though AMD is at the top, they haven’t slowed down improving their product. Intel got complacent and now they’re paying for it. Pigs.

Fundamentals:

EPS: 20.7

Market Capital: 113.6 Billion

Profit Margin: 25.5%

Operating Margin: 14.02%

Revenue: 9.763 Billion

Total Debt: 572 Million

Free Cash Flow: 777 Million

Let's start off with the easy part. AMD is raking in money. Their margins are growing and their finally feeling comfortable. At the beginning of 2016 AMD's already meager revenue was down 20% to 4.3 Billion, Intel controlled 82% of the CPU market, and Nvidia controlled near 80% of the GPU market. Fast forward to 2021, their revenue for 2020 is 9.8 billion and AMD controls 50.8% of the CPU [market](https://macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMD/amd/revenue). Which is more than Intel if you can't do math. That's a remarkable turnaround, and I think the trend will continue. There's still nobody who wants their gpu's, but that's okay. CPU's are their forte, GPU's are just extra cash. For the most part I will compare AMD, INTC, and NVDA because those two are AMD’s biggest competitors. I’ll start with P/E, it goes Intel last w/ 12.5, AMD middle at 45.5, and Nvidia way ahead at 132. No one has been able to challenge Nvda for Market leader in something like two and a half decades, so this is not surprising. However, AMD’s revenue has increased 45% in the last year compared to Nvda’s going down nearly 7%. Intel’s margin is still slightly higher at 55% and AMD at 45, but AMD just began pricing at a higher cost than Intel, so I expect that to change. There is a large discrepancy in the P/B ratio: INTC at 2.36%, NVDA at 12.56% and coming in at the top, AMD at 19.05%. However, we are in a historic bull run, and [Jerome Powell](https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ALeKk00n6xPgB2VSYgvh3QW6B6IjOz0sUQ:1613338536956&amp;q=Jerome+Powell&amp;stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgVuLSz9U3yIo3LjK1fMRoyi3w8sc9YSmdSWtOXmNU4-IKzsgvd80rySypFJLgYoOy-KR4uJC08Sxi5fVKLcrPTVUIyC9PzckBAK_YEhRWAAAA) said don’t worry about the interest rates, so I won't. Every stock looks overvalued, yet they keep going up, so I think AMD is still undervalued relatively. They beat earning predictions by 10% last quarter, and projected that they grow by 37% vs the consensus of 27% this year. AMD has a measly 113 Billion market cap contrasted to 250 billion for Intel and 370 billion for Nvidia. Yet AMD is still taking market share away in both the CPU and GPU sector. Every time I’ve bet against Elon Musk or Lisa Su I’ve lost, so now I’ll ride her coattail to $110. The stock has been flirting with the all-time high for the last week, and I think it’ll jump to $110ish, retreat back to high 90’s, then climb back to $120 where it will settle. Let's go over the good and bad. In 2016

We all know about the supply issues. It's a widespread issue and no one knows really when it will end. One good sign is Biden committed to signing an executive order to conduct a supply chain review and develop a long-term strategy to avoid future shortages. I’m not sure if it will have any tangible short-term effects on either the stock price, or the supply but I do believe it will increase investor confidence. If the government backs it, it literally can’t go tits up. (To be clear, the government is backing the semiconductor supply chain, not AMD. They could go tits up, but I really doubt it.) Another good sign was at the CES keynote, Lisa Su said they’re expecting “tightness in the first half of the year,” meaning supply will be back to normal in the second half of the year? But take this with a grain of salt because back in early 2020, she said supply would be back to normal by Q4 2020. It’s entirely possible supply will return since covid is receding everywhere except the US. There’s a lot of money on the table right now for whoever can get hardware out. She also said they’re investing in new facilities to avoid this problem so hopefully between the new factories and government intervention their supply chain will be future proof for a while.

I’m not sure where what paragraph to talk about this under, so it’s getting its own. Up until their exemption expired two months ago, AMD was paying 7% tariff rates on certain good from China that most other people had to pay 25%. Biden didn’t extend the discount and he hasn’t committed to repealing or leaving the taxes in place. This will impact their margins significantly.

I think the supply issues are overplayed. Obviously it’s a large issue, but it’s not entirely because the supply has gone dry. There was a perfect storm in 2020 between COVID, the PS5, Xbox, AMD/Nvidia GPU’s, Intel/AMD CPU’s, automobile manufacturers, and the tech industry booming. Covid added on to that. Covid simultaneously caused a significant boom in demand for electronics and disrupted supply.

The Semiconductor Industry Association said sales for semiconductors would rise 8.4 percent in 2021, which is 164% the growth rate in 2020 ([source](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/10/whats-causing-the-chip-shortage-affecting-ps5-cars-and-more.html)). A notable jump when there were 433 billion semiconductors sold in 2020. I’ll do the math for you. That’s 710 billion semiconductors being sold during a ‘supply shortage’ this year. Imagine how many would have been sold if supply kept up with demand. Every device has multiple chips. Chips to control the display, manage power, operate connections, or pick up location. And demand is only going to skyrocket as more electronics/sensors are put into more things. On top of that, short supply is a better problem to have than exorbitant excess of quickly depreciating assets. Trying to guess how much of a product you need is tricky, then when companies realized there weren’t going to be enough semiconductors to go around they all tried to get theirs, and in turn increased the discrepancy between supply and demand. The last cause I felt worthwhile to put in here is the tariff war Trump had with China. Trump bared the biggest foundry in China from getting advanced chip manufacturing gear and barred US companies from dealing with them. This also decreased the supply of semiconductors substantially. China still may have an impact though, they announced that semiconductors will make up a substantial portion of its “Made in China 2025” plan. They are currently aiming to produce 70% of the conductors used in China, the majority through SMIC, and have backed their statements up with billions of dollars. However, they’re still far behind private companies though and SMIC has been successfully sued for intellectual property theft on two separate occasions, the first for $135 million, the second for 200 million, 8% of shares to TSMC with the option to obtain around 10% should they think about stealing again. So, I wouldn’t count on this. Should SMIC find a way to make 7nm chips while it’s still the standard, and get around US restrictions, they could provide relief to a thin supply chain right now and make a lot of money. I don’t think it’s likely it’ll happen soon enough to take advantage of the shortage, but I’ve learned to never count China out when it comes to making money. I’ll keep it here because of the possible impact given they figure it out.

Let’s move on to AMD’s near Future. They just released new chips and GPUs in the second half on 2020, so I wouldn’t expect any largely impactful releases soon. I expect them to finish out their product line with midrange GPU’s/CPU’s. Meh, whatever. What I’m excited about is Zen 4.It was scheduled to release late 2021, and in December 2020 they said they were still on schedule, then early this year it changed to sometime in 2022. I expect it to be early 2022 based on leadership sticking to the late 2021 timeline up until Dec 2020, but this is pure speculation. Leaks have Zen 4 forty percent faster than Zen 3. It’ll probably be closer to twenty-five percent, but I’m welcome to AMD surprising me. Even at twenty-five percent, Zen 4 will once again outclass anything Intel is putting out. Also, this will be the first release where AMD is already established as the market leader. Zen 2 let everyone know they were back, Zen 3 showed that it wasn’t a fluke, Zen 4 should cement that and farther sway market share. It’s being built on a 5 nm process node, something Intel hasn’t dreamed of yet. Intel will be outclassed for at least 2 years, likely closer to 5. They haven’t had to compete in so long they forgot what it was like. [Here](https://wccftech.com/amd-5nm-next-generation-zen-4-ryzen-epyc-cpus-to-feature-over-25-ipc-increase/) is a more detailed map of AMD’s releases in the next two ish years. A lot is unknown about Zen 4 now, but hopefully I’ll make enough money from AMD to get one and I’ll let y’all know how it is. They’ve also bought Xilinx for $35 Billion. Xilinx is a market leader in chips with logic gates. They are entirely different from chips we are familiar with today. They can be altered after leaving the factory. People can use this to specialize their CPU for a task. This show where AMD thinks the future of processors is and by having the market leader in that sector, AMD is already ahead. Not much has been said outside of there being a merger.

AMD has some stiff competition. I’ll focus on the CPU market then move to GPU’s, then smaller markets. There has been a shift toward ARM based processors recently: Apple M1, Qualcomm chips, Microsoft building one currently, and AMD had it in their plans but nothing else has been mentioned. They gave a window from 2017 – 2022, so It didn’t seem that important to them. I don’t see this affecting them or forcing them to switch over. Lisa Su was asked about it and she believes the x86 is still the future, so I’ll take her word for it. Who is Apple anyways? Anyways, arm powers the vast majority of mobile devices and high-powered embedded systems. Arm makes money selling the license to design chips based on their intellectual property. They have tech giants like Apple, Qualcomm, Samsung, and Nvidia all paying for the right, it’s undisclosed how much they are paying though. Maybe if we all pool our money we’ll have enough to partake in the fun. While not too important to AMD currently, it could be in the future. Nvidia announced they were buying ARM late 2020. If they succeed it will allow them not pay licensing fees anymore! In addition, they’re flirting with anti-competitive laws, aka a monopoly. All the companies currently leasing the ARM architecture are under strict guidelines restricting how much can be changes, and thereby restricting innovation. This hasn’t been a problem because everyone one had the sameish rules. Nvidia owning arm would give them control over those restrictions and handicap all other competitors. Should they desire to get into the smartphone market, they could innovate freely while restricting or just outright block others access to arm. Objections have been made based on anti-competitiveness by Qualcomm and Microsoft (lol). The deal is also being investigated by the UK, EU, and probably others. The US congress is on a well-deserved vacation for a while after doing nothing for the past 4 years so we’re sitting this one out it seems. Nvidia owning arm could have some scary repercussions. Since we’re focusing on AMD, if the deal goes through just assume AMD will have 0% market share in the mobile industry. Here’s some quick Nvidia DD, if deal = success: Buy.

On to Intel. According to [techspot](https://www.techspot.com/news/88507-intel-grabs-cpu-market-share-back-amd-first.html), AMD’s x86 market share fell from 20.1% to 19.3% even though the X86 market grew 20.1%. I attributed this to lack of supply. To back this up, consider Intel sales jumped the day after AMD said shortage will last at least several months.(10 minutes, maybe more!) I think people were waiting for AMD to resupply, then when they found out there wouldn’t be stock for a few months, they bought Intel. As a whole AMD’s market share declined .7% in Q4 but was up 6.2% for 2020. Now let's walk through what Intel’s up to. They got a new CEO finally. It was going to be another sears if that didn’t happen. Pat Gelsinger, the new CEO, seems pretty solid. I’m seeing comparisons to Steve Jobs returning to Apple. Pat didn’t start Intel, it’s not his child, so I don’t see how that works. But he could reinvigorate some life. He began as an Intel quality-control tech when he was 18. He got his bachelors from Santa Clara, then his masters from Stanford, all while moving up the ranks at Intel. Not bad. He ended up working at Intel for 30 years, which happens to be how long Intel will be using 10nm processors. Also he was the first ever Chief of Technology Officer for Intel from 2000-2005. I’m not sure what that is and I don’t have the energy to look, but most positions with a C in front are important, or at least well paid. He was the CEO for VMware up until a few days ago, and they seem to being doing well, current stock price of $145, no massive amounts of debt or anything. Nothing wild, stable growth. [Here](https://www.linkedin.com/public-profile/in/patgelsinger?challengeId=AQEEh2JtIcpqrgAAAXei0TxLObNVwusIH5OQIEz5fQ0IhjxFtNNGjXVQUjKWuSrCf6Ys6H8bh0Apq1z-FXymHtqn4g3dC1A4Xg&amp;submissionId=611eae20-25c0-6316-847c-037cbaa1386a) is his LinkedIn if you want to check it out. He takes over Intel on the 15th of February (the day after I’m writing this). The stock went up 11% after the announcement came out, giving a necessary break from the constant stream of bad news out of Intel recently. Pat Gelsinger hasn’t said anything of his plans for Intel outside of “make better products” 4head. I’ve read a few articles that claimed he would pretty much stick to Intel status quo, but I disagree. What’s interesting is he has been offered high positions by Intel between when he left and when he comes back tomorrow but he supposedly he turned them down because he couldn’t change things. Which goes directly against sticking to the status quo. Even still, he’s not God and he can’t make 7nm chips out of bread and water so while he might be the catalyst in an upward trend for Intel on the long long haul, they aren’t doing well now.

Intel plans to release their 11th-generation Rocket Lake Processors as early as mid-March (unconfirmed by Intel, subject to change). This seems positive as AMD can’t supply enough processors so ideally Intel fills this gap. Unfortunately, the chips still suck. Benchmarks have been leaked, [here](https://premiumbuilds.com/comparisons/intel-i9-11900k-vs-i9-10900k-vs-ryzen-9-5900x/) is a “good” comparison to AMD. I’ll summarize for those that don’t want to read. Do your own research people, I could spout some bs right now and you wouldn’t know any better. Anyways, Intel’s best 11th gen is about 20% better than their best 10th gen if the benchmarks are to be trusted. I expect they’re cherry picking which specific CPU they’re benching and giving it every possible advantage. A lot of the system info given on the benchmark is blurred out. I suspect they blurred everything other than the speed, socket, and chip to hide that they blew their budget on their cpu and couldn’t afford a good gpu. Ta da, both me and Intel are using a 1070. (: If you scroll a little bit on the link above you’ll see a “good” comparison to AMD’s last gen chips, I’ve been writing for around five hours and can’t be bothered to summarize, to I’ll just quote it.

Even when it comes to competing with AMD’s Ryzen 9 5900X, which is priced in the range of the i9-10900K, the i9-11900K is about 9% faster in single core speeds. Of course, the i9-11900K will severely lack in multi core speeds, as it is missing four cores and eight threads. Also, if the leaked clock speeds are to be trusted, the i9-11900K will have a significantly faster boost clock speed, reaching 5.3 GHz, versus the 4.8 GHz of the Ryzen 9 5900X. But if we are to compare the i9-11900K with a Ryzen CPU that has an equivalent number of cores and threads – which in this case is the Ryzen 7 5800X – we see that it has a 12% faster single-core speeds, and just about the same multi-core scores.”

I put quotations around good because this is bad. Intel’s next gen chips should not be competing with AMD’s last gen chips. To give an easier frame of reference, here’s an example of how next gen chips should measure up at minimum. I compared last gen i9-9900K (Intel's Best 9th gen chip released Oct 2018) vs Ryzen 7 1800X (AMD’s best 1’st gen Ryzen released March 2017) \*I’m ignoring the Threadripper line because they are targeted at a different, smaller audience. [Results](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare/AMD-Ryzen-7-1800X-vs-Intel-i9-9900K/2966vs3334). As you can see, the i9 beats the 1800x in every category except thread/core count because Intel refuses to move into the future. And this is pretty much Intel’s best processer they will be releasing until 2023. Pat has stated that Intel is figuring out how to make 7nm chips much quicker now but what is he supposed to say? “I don’t know how tf Bob Swan managed to lose this much market share in 2 years when Intel was so far ahead of AMD.” No, he needs to say something that inspires confidence in new leadership. When Bob Swan was Ceo 7nm chips were pushed back until 2023, and I’m not sure Pat has the power to advance a timeline that quickly. They’re taking a backseat until they cough up 7nm processors or tap a different market. To show how confident AMD is in their position, they priced chips above their intel counterpart after making Intel slash prices one-two years ago. They have the superior product and finally have the recognition to act like it. Intel has been relegated to the budge chip for a few years minimum. Because if you think Zen 4 won’t blow whatever Intel is about to release, you’re wrong. Intel will also be releasing Alder Lake in the 4th quarter of 2021. I couldn’t find any leaks or information about it but I assume it’ll be 10nm just like the rest of their chips. For those that don’t know, the smaller you can make the processor the faster clock speeds you’ll get, manufacturing cost go down, and quality improves. A quick example is: Say you have a wafer with 3 defects on it, but you can fit 100 processors on it, because they’re so small. You have 97 usable processors from this single wafer. While if you were Intel you could only fit one processor per wafer, and it’s unusable because there’s 3 defects on your processor. Exaggerated, but gets the point across I think.

One thing Intel has going for them is brand recognition. They were the market leader for more than a decade and did well to establish that. AMD was a great value brand. It will take a while for that sentiment to change, especially with those that don’t keep up with tech.

Last paragraph about Intel. I promise. Last fall Pat said if their factories can’t reliably deliver on processors, he’d consider outsourcing. The only suppliers realistically big enough for this are TSM or Samsung. TSM already makes chips for self-driving cars on behalf of Intel, so advantage TSM. I suspect circumstances have changed though because Pat Gelsinger stated during an earning call on 1/21/2021 that he was “confident the majority of our 2023 products will be manufactured internally.” Given that they haven't started outsourcing, it’s possible. If they do outsource it was result in the loss of at least 30,000 jobs. I don’t know if they care about that though. Extra DD again, if the deal goes through, buy whoever gets it. Maybe buy TSM anyways. Bloomberg [reported](https://www.crn.com/news/components-peripherals/intel-may-outsource-production-of-some-top-chips-to-samsung-tsmc-report) that Intel was in discussions w/ both companies to outsource products starting 2023. (I don’t' have a Bloomberg subscription, so I’m taking crn’s word for it.) Additionally, Intel was awarded a huge defense contract by the US government. Whoever managed that should get a raise. They’ve also entered a three-year collaboration with Sandia National Labs to fight nuclear proliferation and terrorism. Not sure if that’ll make them money or what.

The server market represents a lot of potential for AMD. Intel dominates the market with like 90% market share, but amd’s share increased from 5% to 8% in 2019 and is double digits in midway through 2020. This is the most recent accurate data I could [find](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/16/amd-is-about-to-double-down-on-a-huge-opportunity/). Their current market share doesn’t matter anyways. It’s not about where they’re at right now, it’s about where Lisa Su is going to take them. AMD showcased their 3rd gen server processors named “Milan” by pitching them in a weather prediction simulation against Intel’s Xeon Gold 6258R. The Milan was 68% faster in single-socket performance and 46% faster in dual socket. Now, I know, I know. “Wtf you just bitched about Intel comparing their top-of-the-line next gen cpu with old hardware. Yes I did. I think this is different because AMD blew them out of the water. The presentation was given by AMD, so everything was hand-picked in their favor, but it’s still impressive. If you’re skeptical about it, good. Wait until Intel releases their server chip and see how the two compare. But guess what. The Milan is based on a 7 nm node. It was pitted against a 14 nm node, and Intel’s new server cpu will be ….......10 nm. Morons. If they can take away a significant portion of the server, Intel could start to lose their hold as the staple processor. Who knows what will happen then? Rain upwards? Walk on your hands? Me passing CS? Doubt it.

We can run though laptops quickly. AMD is releasing their 4000 series sometime this year, hopefully it’ll be good. Intel is still entrenched in this market and they have a lot of support from people like Dell and HP who keep putting overpriced underperforming Intel chips in their best computers and limiting AMD processors w/ weaker hardware. But again, AMD market share here went up 10%, so we might be seeing the shift happen. I looked up the best laptops to buy because that what I imagine people who don’t understand tech do. The top 3 on nearly all websites are Mac’s or Intel driven. I think that just shows mainstream sentiment hasn’t changed much. Or maybe I was looking up all my Intel data before then, so then they recommended all Intel. The mobile market followed a similar trend, just imagine everywhere I put laptops it says mobile.

Lastly, the graphics card market. Their 10-K doesn’t say a lot about it or what they plan to do. Just that they are competing with Nvidia, Intel is developing their own high-end gpus. Of topic, but both Nvidia and Intel are trying to break into each other's respective markets. Nothing serious has come out about Intel’s GPU’s so I can’t tell you much about that. Nvidia is the market leader, there is no question in this market. AMD was in the same position vs Intel five years ago, so it’s possible, but hard. Intel slowed down innovating, Nvidia has not. AMD cards also have a bad reputation of being buggy and having bad drivers. Nvidia has a nice program in Gforce and GSync. I don’t see AMD leading this market unless Nvidia hands it to them. However, they have a few things going for them. Competition is good for the industry and I think people realize that after Intel didn't innovate until they were forced to. There's also a large entry barrier, so it's unlikely they'll have to compete with anyone outside of Nvidia and Intel. And I'd give Intel at least a few generations to work out the kinks. It ends up being Nvidia vs AMD for a few years minimum and I believe AMD will take some market share. Not lead, but hold their own.

Consoles were a big win for AMD in 2020. They won contracts to provide chips for both the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. Sales between the two equate to 9-10 billion dollars. However, both console sales have been trending down while Switch sales have been trending up for the past three [years](https://www.vgchartz.com/article/442352/switch-vs-ps4-vs-xbox-one-global-lifetime-salesjanuary-2020/). Particularly the Xbox. I’ve the argument that as consoles catch up to PC performance they will take market share [away](https://www.extremetech.com/gaming/290387-report-20-million-pc-gamers-could-switch-to-consoles-by-2022). I don’t agree with this analysis but I put it in here so you can choose for yourself. My reasoning is:

1. Cross play is becoming common, don’t have to get a console to play w/ console friends,
2. PC has a higher entry barrier usually, but last longer, and can upgrade one or two things at a time for a few hundred dollars instead of getting an entire new system
3. Not that many must-have exclusives anymore (Microsoft punching the air right now)
4. I’m not sure how the Switch fits in, Nintendo is always a wild card to me. Also, the KFC console hasn’t set a release date, but if it does drop I can see the market shifting on its head and going 100% toward KFC. It will be powered by Intel. I’m not actually sure I would want my brand associated with KFC, but Intel didn’t ask me for some reason. That sounds like something a 60 year old guy names Bob Swan would do.

In conclusion, I think AMD will be the market leader in CPU’s for at least 8 years. I think their stock will keep bouncing for a while until the supply squeeze goes away, then earning will come out, Intel will be broke, and AMD will laugh all the way to the bank. There are a few big ifs, the supply chain being fixed, the ARM deal, and figuring out what Intel's new CEO is up to.

if you read all this way I’m impressed. You are very dedicated and I appreciate you because I don’t have anyone else to share all my research with. My roommates eyes glaze over after 30 seconds. It might not flow very well because it was all bullet points before hand. I've put all the sources I could find again in here. I'd love to hear anything I didn't bring up, or contest my points. It's all imaginary money anyways.

28,DELL,Ubiquiti – UI – Momentum stock with Potential Short Squeeze or Leveraged Buyout,"Ubiquiti Inc. develops networking technology for service providers, enterprises, and consumers.

On 2/5/2021 they announced another quarter that exceeded expectations with strong global demand for their products. The growth/adoption of their products into the enterprise demonstrate that the company continues to gain traction against the likes of Cisco (CSCO).

For those that read a headline and act: A couple of items to be aware of.

1. While the stock has a 20.8B market cap, it only trades a little over 100k shares a day or about 1.5% of the available float. This means using limit orders when buying or selling might be best. Otherwise the MM’s will take advantage of you.
2. The liquidity/spreads in the option market are horrible. Outright buying the stock is likely the way to play this stock

**A Little Background**

Ubiquiti was founded by Robert Pera and went public in 2011. This is the same Robert Pera that owns the Memphis Grizzlies. I like to think of him in the same light as Mark Cuban. He is a disruptor by nature and has an anti-establishment approach. He is not always conventional in his methods when engaging with the media and public which likely results in less overall hype around Ubiquiti.

As of 12/31/2020 there were 62.8m shares outstanding. Founder Robert Pera owns 56.2m shares or 89.6% of the company.

The company has been aggressively buying back shares, reducing the shares outstanding by over 2m in 2020. As of 12/31/20 they still had $385.2m authorized under the “2020 May Program” which facilitates the company’s repurchase program.

According to [Fintel.io](https://fintel.io/), institutions own 6.9m shares, resulting in over 100% ownership between Pera and institutions. Some percentage of these institutions represent index funds that are not actively managed. The institutional ownership may be overstated as a result of stale data and/or the company’s repurchase of 309,133 shares in the last 3 months of 2020.

Then there are the retail investors that own some small slice of this company. Some of the retail investors are self-declared Ubiquiti “Fan Boys” such as myself that have owned the stock for years and have deployed their equipment in our homes and across the enterprise’s where we work.

The end result is a float of 6.5m shares of which some percentage that is owned by index funds or owned by “Fan Boys” and not actively traded.

The company just declared another $0.40 dividend. With $1.60 in anticipated dividends over the next 12 months, Pera will be taking home an estimated $90m per year in dividends. Why is this relevant? Pera is is able to generate cash from his Ubiquiti ownership, without the need of selling shares. He just holds his current shares while increasing his ownership percentage through the company’s stock repurchase program.

**Now for the Shorts**

As of 1/15/21 there were 1.04m shares short which represents 15.94% of the float. We will have to see how these change when the 1/31 numbers are released this week. The low daily average volume results in a Short ratio of 10.38 as calculated by Yahoo finance as of 1/15.

With a great quarter behind them, a growing business, fewer COVID-19 related supply chain risks and combined with insiders who generally do not sell, where will the shorts get shares to cover their bets if the stock continues to move against them?

Pera has not shown a desire to sell.Mid-Cap index funds are not actively managed.“Fan Boys” are not selling anytime soon.The Company continues to repurchase shares.

I believe short covering could result in a monumental short squeeze if the stocks momentum continues an upward trajectory.

**Why not a leveraged Buy-out**

Now I am certainly not an expert on leveraged buy-out’s, but what would it take for Pera to decide to take the whole thing private. Like Michael Dell taking his namesake company private in 2013 before going public again in 2018.

The company is generating great cash flow, actively reducing the number of shares available and is predominantly owned by a multi-billionaire.

With $385.2m still available to repurchase shares, at a current market price of $330, this could remove another 1.16m shares from the float, making it that much easier to buy-out the company.

Is the stock repurchase program a precursor to something bigger?

**Conclusion**

You could conclude this continues to be a growth story of a company looking to disrupt the status quo. They are profitable, growing, pay a dividend and demonstrated good cash flow all the while repurchasing their stock.

This could be a massive, short squeeze in the making as the short ratio is 10.38 and float continues to be reduced as a result of the share repurchase program.

The endgame could be a leveraged buy-out that sees Ubiquiti taken private resulting in a handsome reward for Pera’s loyal followers.

I Love Ubiquiti’s products and this stock.

193,DELL,Ubiquiti – UI – Momentum stock with Potential Short Squeeze or Leveraged Buyout,"Ubiquiti Inc. develops networking technology for service providers, enterprises, and consumers.

On 2/5/2021 Ubiquiti announced another quarter that exceeded expectations with strong global demand for their products. The growth/adoption of their products into the enterprise demonstrate that the company continues to gain traction against the likes of Cisco (CSCO).

For those that read a headline and act: A couple of items to be aware of.

1. While the stock has a 20.8B market cap, it only trades a little over 100k shares a day or about 1.5% of the available float. This means using limit orders when buying or selling might be best. Otherwise the MM’s will take advantage of you.
2. The liquidity/spreads in the option market are horrible. Outright buying the stock is likely the way to play this stock

**A Little Background**

Ubiquiti was founded by Robert Pera and went public in 2011. This is the same Robert Pera that owns the Memphis Grizzlies. I like to think of him in the same light as Mark Cuban. He is a disruptor by nature and has an anti-establishment approach. He is not always conventional in his methods when engaging with the media and public which likely results in less overall hype around Ubiquiti.

As of 12/31/2020 there were 62.8m shares outstanding. Founder Robert Pera owns 56.2m shares or 89.6% of the company.

The company has been aggressively buying back shares, reducing the shares outstanding by over 2m in 2020. As of 12/31/20 they still had $385.2m authorized under the “2020 May Program” which facilitates the company’s repurchase program.

According to [Fintel.io](https://fintel.io/), institutions own 6.9m shares, resulting in over 100% ownership between Pera and institutions. Some percentage of these institutions represent index funds that are not actively managed. The institutional ownership may be overstated as a result of stale data and/or the company’s repurchase of 309,133 shares in the last 3 months of 2020.

Then there are the retail investors that own some small slice of this company. Some of the retail investors are self-declared Ubiquiti “Fan Boys” such as myself that have owned the stock for years and have deployed their equipment in our homes and across the enterprise’s where we work.

The end result is a float of 6.5m shares of which some percentage that is owned by index funds or owned by “Fan Boys” and not actively traded.

The company just declared another $0.40 dividend. With $1.60 in anticipated dividends over the next 12 months, Pera will be taking home an estimated $90m per year in dividends. Why is this relevant? Pera is is able to generate cash from his Ubiquiti ownership, without the need of selling shares. He just holds his current shares while increasing his ownership percentage through the company’s stock repurchase program.

**Now for the Shorts**

As of 1/15/21 there were 1.04m shares short which represents 15.94% of the float. We will have to see how these change when the 1/31 numbers are released this week. The low daily average volume results in a Short ratio of 10.38 as calculated by Yahoo finance as of 1/15.

With a great quarter behind them, a growing business, fewer COVID-19 related supply chain risks and combined with insiders who generally do not sell, where will the shorts get shares to cover their bets if the stock continues to move against them?

Pera has not shown a desire to sell.Mid-Cap index funds are not actively managed.“Fan Boys” are not selling anytime soon.The Company continues to repurchase shares.

I believe short covering could result in a monumental short squeeze if the stocks momentum continues an upward trajectory.

**Why not a leveraged Buy-out**

Now I am certainly not an expert on leveraged buy-out’s, but what would it take for Pera to decide to take the whole thing private. Like Michael Dell taking his namesake company private in 2013 before going public again in 2018.

The company is generating great cash flow, actively reducing the number of shares available and is predominantly owned by a multi-billionaire.

With $385.2m still available to repurchase shares, at a current market price of $330, this could remove another 1.16m shares from the float, making it that much easier to buy-out the company.

Is the stock repurchase program a precursor to something bigger?

**Conclusion**

You could conclude this continues to be a growth story of a company looking to disrupt the status quo. They are profitable, growing, pay a dividend and demonstrated good cash flow all the while repurchasing their stock.

This could be a massive, short squeeze in the making as the short ratio is 10.38 and float continues to be reduced as a result of the share repurchase program.

The endgame could be a leveraged buy-out that sees Ubiquiti taken private resulting in a handsome reward for Pera’s loyal followers.

**TL;DR** Ubiquiti $UI is a position to add to your portfolio based on it fundamentals, momentum and the possibility of a short squeeze that could be a moon shot based on the small float and ongoing share repurchase program.  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

I Love Ubiquiti’s products and this stock.

I have been long since 5/22/2014 and have added to my position as recently as 2/5/21

194,DELL,A brief history of Melvin Capitals &amp; Point72s founding,"**BE CAREFUL - LOTS OF WORDS**

I love the different forms of DD we had in the past couple of weeks. Most of them were very technical and I personally found a more and more increasing interest in the people we love to hate. 

I spend the past couple of hours trying to understand what happened in a time where most of us were busy getting to the new level cap of Lich King whilst boomers managed to fuck up the economy. Yes. I’m talking about 2008.

You see, Melvin Capitals story begins under the wings of Steve Cohens S.A.C. Capital. US Attorney Preet Bharara described them as following in 2013: 

*  “culture of corporate corruption”
*  “institutional indifference to unlawful conduct \[that\] resulted in insider trading that was substantial, pervasive, and on a scale without known precedent in the hedge-fund industry.”
*  “a veritable magnet of market cheaters”

If that isn't off to a great start, right? To understand the story I'm about to tell you, here a short summary of how SAC was structured: 

„SAC was structured like a bicycle wheel, with the spokes consisting of about 100 portfolio managers with their own teams of analysts and traders working in competition with the other teams. Camaraderie in SAC’s offices was low. At the center was Cohen, 57, the only connector between the different groups, who would take the best ideas from each and trade on them himself. Aside from losing money, there was nothing Cohen hated more than a portfolio manager who didn’t communicate vigorously and often.“

In 2008 two employees were charged with insider trading. One of them was Mather Martoma who was involved in insider trading with a new Alzheimer drug that first showed positive and then negative results which helped Cohen get out at a perfect time and thus avoided a $275million loss. 

The other was Jon Horvath, he claimed that his asshole boss Steinberg told him get insider information to get better trades or else he would be fired. So he did with DELL and also passed this information to Steinberg. With this insider information he found out DELL was going to have a bad quarter and built up a massive short position only to find out that his even BIGGER ASSHOLE BOSS COHEN was long DELL. And FUCK was he scared of Cohen, the ragey ass went on a rampage whenever he lost money so he mailed Steinberg to tell him about his concerns. Now it get’s interesting. Steinberg told Cohen and Cohen told Steinberg to figure out who the fuck was right. Jon or the person suggesting him this trade – Gabriel fucking Plotkin. You may be asking “Who dis?“ -it's **Melvin Capitals later fucking founder**. After some back and forth Plotkin realized Jon had the better source and confirmed to sell the long position. After its earnings announement DELL dropped 14%. Good job Jon. 

Later that evening, Cohen sent Steinberg a message that read: “Nice job on dell.” Steinberg’s response was, “Thanks… this ole dog can still hunt”.

This happened again. This time Steinberg/Jon being long, Cohen short. Here a chat: 

&gt;AIM:mike72ms \[Steinberg\] dell rpts thrusday  
AIM:cas— \[Cohen\] y …   
AIM:mike72ms **we like it**…weve been good here if u remember  
AIM:cas— call me… it’s a shame-cause I can be helpful to you too but that;s life  
AIM:mike72ms steve I have an analyst that covers this stock… he has industry contacts… im not hiding anything from u

Cohen replied: “I would prefer to talkon phone”.

I decided to leave in the chat because both sound like fucking retards and Cohen like a salty 9 year old. Truely, no different to us

Martoma, the guy with the Alzheimer drug was convicted to a 9 year prison sentence. 

Jon decided to work with prosecutors to try help fuck over Steinberg but in 2015 the case was abandoned. 

In 2011 Plotkin was apparently investigated for trading Weight Watchers based on insider information. An SAC spokesperson denied this claim however by saying „Gabe Plotkin has built a successful career on a commitment to sound fundamental research“

In 2013 SAC pleaded guilty to an insider trading charge, paid an $1.8 billion penalty and changed its name to Point72 Asset Management. Cohen shrunk the companies size and said goodbye to many of his portfolio managers. 

In 2013 the SEC also charged Steve Cohen with a „failing to supervise“ civil charge in regards to Martoma with the goal to give Cohen a lifetime ban from supervising funds that manage outside money. In the end they settled for a two year ban which I guess is almost the same thing. It is rumoured that Plotkin is the mysterious „Portfolio Manager A“ in this charge

In 2014-2015 Cohen took steps to „increase compliance and oversight” at Point72. He hired former F.B.I agents and federal prosecutors. For example Kevin J. O’Connor and Vincent Tortorella. Some saw this as an effort to “gain the confidence of regulators and permit him to again manage money for outside investors.“

In 2014 Gabriel Plotkin, „one of Cohens most successful traders” founded Melvin Capital. Cohen backed him with a small loan of 200 milion dollars.

In a memo sent to more than 800 employees of Point72, Mr. Cohen said that after SAC pleaded guilty, he “vowed that what happened to SAC would never happen to Point72.” The settlement “is not and cannot — be a reason to become complacent,” Mr. Cohen wrote, adding that the firm would become a leader in compliance.

Fact is, the SEC spent almost a decade trying to get dirt on Steve Cohen and failed. Plotkin got a slap on the wrist by being hinted at in the civil charge against Cohen and Steinbergs case was dropped. But hey, the **analyst** who forwarded insider information in 2008 about an alzheimer drug will be freed from prison soon after 9 years in jail. I know insider trading is irrelevant to the current situation however I found the story interesting because it shows by what rules they play and what type of people they are. 

TL;DR: The people behind Melvin and friends are frauds and cheaters. They never played by the rules, never will. SEC knows this but literally can't do anything.

everything is allegedly, i dont know anything, there are probably mistakes in this story, im no lawyer, no financial advice, no suicidal tendencies, have a rocket  🚀",130,14,1612257274.0,2021-02-02T09:14:34+00:00,t3_larp1a,wallstreetbets

Authorities reviewing trades by Plotkin, other managers

\* Probe concerns trading in Weight Watchers in 2011

\* Plotkin makes decisions involving $1.2 bln in assets

\* Plotkin on SAC emails about Dell earnings

By Matthew Goldstein and Emily Flitter and Jennifer Ablan

NEW YORK, Dec 19 (Reuters) - U.S. authorities are examining trading by one of SAC Capital Advisors’ most successful portfolio managers, Gabriel Plotkin, as part of a probe into the $14 billion hedge fund firm’s investment in Weight Watchers International Inc last year, according to a person familiar with the investigation.

Plotkin, a specialist in consumer and retail stocks who makes investment decisions for more than $1.2 billion worth of assets, is among several SAC portfolio managers whose trades are being investigated, said the source, who did not want to be identified. The source would not name the other managers.

Federal authorities are trying to determine whether any of SAC Capital’s retail and consumer portfolio managers traded Weight Watchers shares based on non-public confidential information about the diet company, said the source and another person familiar with the investigation.

The two sources said it is too soon to conclude if there was any insider trading. Authorities have not charged Plotkin with any wrongdoing.

Plotkin, who is based in New York and works for SAC Capital’s Sigma Capital Management division, did not return a request for comment.

“Gabe Plotkin has built a successful career on a commitment to sound fundamental research,” said an SAC Capital spokesman, who declined to comment on the Weight Watchers probe.

With a hedge fund the size of SAC Capital, which was founded 20 years ago by Steven A. Cohen, it is not uncommon for many portfolio managers to be trading the same stocks.

Last year, Plotkin and his team of a half-dozen traders and analysts produced between $150 million and $200 million in profits for Cohen’s fund, some of which came from trades of shares of Weight Watchers, said a person familiar with the hedge fund, who declined to be identified because he is not authorized to speak for SAC Capital.

Over the past two years, Plotkin, 34, has emerged as one of the most successful portfolio managers at SAC Capital, said this person. Plotkin and his wife own a condo on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, as well as a home in Southampton, which is part of the Hamptons’ summer playground for the city’s wealthy.

The Weight Watchers inquiry, first reported by Reuters on Dec. 7, is focusing on trading by SAC Capital in the first half of 2011 when the Stamford, Connecticut-based hedge fund bought and sold some 2.1 million shares during a period when the diet company’s stock price roughly doubled.

The probe is the latest in a long line of investigations by federal authorities dating back to at least 2007 that have looked into whether some of SAC Capital’s outsized performance is the result of trades relying on insider information.

A spokesman for U.S prosecutors in New York declined to comment.

Plotkin is one of 11 portfolio managers at SAC Capital who trade consumer and retail stocks. It is not clear how many of those managers, all of whom manage less money than Plotkin, are being scrutinized by federal authorities.

Plotkin, who came to SAC Capital in 2006 from North Sound Capital, is widely known in the $2 trillion hedge fund industry as one of the top consumer and retail traders, said several people who know him.

Plotkin’s name recently surfaced in several emails that federal prosecutors introduced into evidence in a separate insider trading case. In that case, Todd Newman, a former portfolio manager at Diamondback Capital Management, and Anthony Chiasson, co-founder of Level Global Investors, on Monday were convicted of illegal trading in Dell Inc shares.

The emails involved discussions by Jon Horvath - a former trader at SAC Capital’s Sigma division who pleaded guilty in September to trading on inside information - with his former supervisor, Michael Steinberg, and Plotkin. The prosecutors used the emails to persuade a federal judge to declare Steinberg an uncharged co-conspirator for the purposes of the trial.

In the emails, reviewed by Reuters, there was a discussion between Steinberg and Horvath about Dell’s upcoming earnings. These emails were also sent to Plotkin. In an August 2008 email to Steinberg and Plotkin, Horvath writes he has a “2nd hand read from someone at the company” about gross margins and earnings.

Steinberg, whose lawyer did not return a request for comment, has not been charged with any wrongdoing.

U.S. prosecutors, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Securities and Exchange Commission have been gradually ratcheting up pressure on Cohen, 56, one of the hedge fund industry’s best-known managers.

Two weeks ago, U.S. prosecutors charged a former SAC Capital employee, Mathew Martoma, with using inside information to generate profits and avoid losses totaling $276 million in shares of two drug stocks. Martoma has not entered a plea, but his lawyer has said he expects to be exonerated.

The SEC also has formally warned SAC Capital that the firm could face civil charges.

Martoma is the seventh person once associated with SAC Capital to be either charged or implicated by federal authorities in insider trading. Authorities have not charged Cohen with any wrongdoing and the firm has repeatedly said it has strong compliance measures in place.

The investigations have not had a visible impact on SAC Capital’s investor redemptions or employee turnover.

The investigation into trading in Weight Watchers comes as federal authorities are also looking at trading by SAC Capital in shares of bio-tech company InterMune in 2010. A person familiar with the InterMune and Weight Watchers investigation said authorities are looking into some of the trading done by former SAC Capital portfolio manager Nikej Shah.

Shah, who left SAC Capital last year, did not return several calls seeking comment.

InterMune declined to comment. Weight Watchers said it has not been contacted about any investigation. (Reporting By Matthew Goldstein, Emily Flitter and Jennifer Ablan; Editing by Martin Howell and Steve Orlofsky)",14,2,1611758067.0,2021-01-27T14:34:27+00:00,t3_l65pn6,wallstreetbets
50,DELL,Weekend IV Report - Tickers with low IV and cheaper premiums,"What's up fellas at r/options. I made a tool called [FD Ranker](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/fd-ranker) that logs the average IV of popular tickers. The tool is inclusive of almost 1,000 tickers now.

**What is this tool good for**

I posted in ThetaGang the list with HIGH IV options which is great for running the wheel or selling options. This list is an inverse of that list and displays tickers where IV is pretty low, thus, purchasing calls will likely be cheaper. For example, AAPL implied volatility right now is almost back to the pre-March lows. Remember a low IV can go lower and a high IV can go higher. Do your DD before entering any positions!

Currently, it scans reddit to find (new)  posts made about a certain ticker, build sentiment of the post, the comments etc. 
It also scans google trends to check Google search trends for the past 24 hours.

Overtime, as more and more data is collected, I can create a dashboard so show and possibly run machine learning algorithm to predict which new ticker will do dell by checking past trends of the data collected. 

I also plan to add news analytics, and link articles directly, do basic company due diligence (financials would be the first start) etc BUT, it's expensive get this data (the server to get the news data costs $20 a month, add another $30 for servers, computation power etc), so would people be interested in a subscription model, nothing too crazy, a few dollars a month to help with the upkeep and of it goes well, hire more devs go enhance the platform.

So I guess my question is, would you pay for this kind of information and what additional features would you like to see.",1,0,1611180294.0,2021-01-20T22:04:54+00:00,t3_l1jrno,stocks
196,DELL,BB Best Buy is going to the moon!!,"Guys! I have done some really deep research here and I really believe Best Buy is going to the moon. 

After 2 incredibly surreal experiences I know I can’t be wrong here. After my stupid brother kept getting on my PC to watch gerbil porn (most viruses come from gerbil porn) my computer was just chocked full of Trojans. So why do I know Best Buy is a moon shot? I took my dell down to the Best Buy and I just had Geek squad install Morton’s Anti-virus and my dell has never run better!!! I can play gerbil free Minecraft again.

Not only that, but while I was waiting for the geeks to rescue my dell, I was sampling my favorite smash mouth album in the car audio section (it still exists) and my mind was blown. I cranked that shit so loud that this toddler started screaming and I knew I had to have these panty droppers in my Pontiac Aztec. Easily doubled the value. Best Buy hooked me up!!!

Best Buy has turned my PC, my car, and my life around. So you know they are going to turn this stock around. Invest everything you have.",29,21,1611093126.0,2021-01-19T21:52:06+00:00,t3_l0u8dw,wallstreetbets
51,DELL,IV Report - Tickers with low IV and cheaper premiums,"What's up fellas at r/options. I made a tool called [FD Ranker](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/fd-ranker) that logs the average IV of popular tickers. The tool is inclusive of almost 1,000 tickers now.

**What is this tool good for**

I posted in ThetaGang the list with HIGH IV options which is great for running the wheel or selling options. This list is an inverse of that list and displays tickers where IV is pretty low, thus, purchasing calls will likely be cheaper. For example, AAPL implied volatility right now is almost back to the pre-March lows. Remember a low IV can go lower and a high IV can go higher. Do your DD before entering any positions!

197,DELL,NOK - Invest in the Future,"I know nobody thinks much about Nokia these days, what with their phone business mostly going to seed, but within the last two years, they:

-Totally restructured the company

-Hired a new CEO with an excellent track record who got his start as an executive at the company - this is personal for him, a triumphant return to his roots, so he'll be motivated

-Totally revamped both smartphone and feature phone offerings to optimize their portfolio for growth markets

-Stand to gain massively from the Western world's recent spate of bans on Huawei's network tech

-Shifted their telecom business strategy to go all-in on Open RAN, and will be the best positioned network tech manufacturer to offer future-proof tech, including both hardware and software solutions that will be used by other Open RAN adopters

https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobodonnell/2020/08/26/will-5g-networks-move-to-open-ran/?sh=5503a85e23df

The companies that stand to gain the most from the move to Open RAN (aside from Nokia) are some of the most powerful names in the global market - Google, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Samsung, Qualcomm, Verizon, AT&amp;T, Dish Network, Rakuten, Cisco, Dell, HP, VMWare...oh and let's not forget telecoms, who will see massive long term cost savings from more modular networking tech and more competitive supply chains - especially those who take advantage of the cost savings that come with Open RAN to expand into developing markets.

Financials: EBITDA margin trending up, debt ratios stable and only increasing due to investments in new tech. They were in a hole after their phone business tanked, but they appear to be out of it: telecom has been booming, and their recent increase in debt seems to be as expected for the planned restructure and realignment.

Oh, and even if you're not in it for the long haul, there could be a decent short-term upside with fresh ink on a 5 year deal with the fastest growing telecom in the US:

https://seekingalpha.com/news/3651345-t-mobile-inks-new-5-year-deal-ericsson-and-nokia-for-5g-expansion

The Street is sleeping on NOK big time, and betting against a better, more secure, decentralized, sustainable, and affordable future for the internet and the supply chains that support it.

They'll be releasing 2020 annual report in week 9 - that's enough time to get in before everyone realizes that they're alive and well, their only debt is coming from investments in new tech that is a huge boon for market leaders, and are poised to revolutionize global digital infrastructure.



Get in loser, we're saving the internet.

This is not financial advice. I am not a broker, advisor, or financial planner. I am long on NOK.",117,58,1610634288.0,2021-01-14T14:24:48+00:00,t3_kx6kws,wallstreetbets

198,DELL,The Real Short Interest of GME and other Details,"All you frickin autists who have no idea have been reading yahoo finance and shit to say that there is a 130%+ short interest in GME. I have spent a few hours looking into all this shit

1. The short interest is like 60%. 

https://www.shortsight.com/short-interest-of-float-2-0/

https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1346561814956552193?s=21

2. Legally, the passive investors have to recall their shares on a “material vote”, practically I think material isn’t defined. They didn’t recall their shares when there was a proxy battle between permit/hestia and the board. Only chance they recall their votes is if there is a go private, even then they might not. Not sure about this.

https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/literature/publication/securities-lending-viewed-through-the-sustainability-lens.pdf

3. Don’t underestimate how long shorts can and will hold out. Look at Tesla. The passive investors DO have a handshake agreement as you can see in the blackrock PDF. Read the examples of Dell and Telecom Italia. Incidentally other 

That being said, GME being taken private is still the key element to a short squeeze.

199,DELL,DD: AMD is undervalued 🚀,"DD time retards.   


AMD. Ya heard of it? No, not American Mini Dicks, thats your 2nd favorite subreddit. I'm talking Advanced Micro Devices.   


What does AMD do? They make CPU and GPU's. What do those do? Well without computer processors, you wouldn't be able to yolo your life savings on OTM options, and your wife wouldn't be able to send nudes to her boyfriend.  GPU's are cool too. Right now NVDA is making the best GPU's. But AMD is 2nd best! NVDA is currently trading at 529.78. That's pretty good. But AMD is only trading at 94.95!   


I know that youre thinking little buddy. If AMD is making the 2nd best GPU's, shouldn't they be a little closer? That's right retard. But there is more.   


AMD makes CPU's too. Those are rad. In fact, AMD is making some of the best processors in the world right now. That's a big deal, CPU's are used in everything. Probably takes some really smart nerds to make those. Not anybody can do that.   


Intel is falling behind in the competition, and AAPL is starting to make their own CPU's. That leaves the rest of the market for AMD.  Surely lots of companies (HP, Dell, Lenovo) will want to use the BEST (AMD) CPU's in their desktops and laptops. And they are already trending that way. Some of the best computers you can buy right now have AMD processors. That's right, your favorite porn machine might have an AMD processor in it right now.   


YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE HAS AN AMD CHIP IN IT?  


EVERY XBOX SERIES X AND PLAYSTATION 5. That's right. If you didn't waste your stimmy on one of these consoles, your wife's boyfriend probably did. And if he didn't buy one for himself, he probably bought 2 or 3 for your kids. Theyre everywhere. These things are selling out everywhere, and we all know it. The processing power that allows you to look at those sweet cyberpunk tits is all thanks to AMD.   


But what gives? AMD is in every Xbox and PlayStation, their stock hasn't moved much since those releases..  


That's right, youre getting it! Lisa Su is gonna drop a big fat bomb on the shareholders this month during earnings, letting everybody know that they made millions. (Probably)  


AMD is undervalued.

52,DELL,Weekend IV Report - Tickers with low IV and cheap premiums,"What's up fellas at Options. I made a tool called [FD Ranker](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/fd-ranker) that logs the average IV of popular tickers. The tool is inclusive of almost 1,000 tickers now.

**What is this tool good for**

I posted in ThetaGang the list with HIGH IV options which is great for running the wheel or selling options. This list is an inverse of that list and displays tickers where IV is pretty low, thus, purchasing calls will likely be cheaper. For example, AAPL implied volatility right now is almost back to the pre-March lows. Remember a low IV can go lower and a high IV can go higher. Do your DD before entering any positions!

200,DELL,PLTR - Technical/Fundamental Analysis from a Professional Investor - Update 12/29,"So a lot has happened with the shares.

The wedge looks like it has broken down, but it could easily be just an extension of a wedge. The point is that we don't have a full breakdown unless we spend considerable time below 25, then I could maybe see things fall back down to 20. I think it is far more likely we just remain in this extended consolidation phase of 25-30 until we get some sort of a catalyst or a short squeeze.

But this is not the point of the post today. Today I am here to convince you why a cost basis of 20 or 25 doesn't matter for PLTR. You are buying the company at around 40-50x 2020E sales, Which seems quite high  (not as much compared to SNOW and some other big data plays) but still. So why bother with PLTR?

Before I proceed, I know most people who are here can't read, and I am going to be dropping a gigantic wall of text which I expect all maybe two of your guys to read, so here is the short form  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**

This was the primer I had written on Information Technology  back in 2017

[https://etherealvalue.wordpress.com/2017/02/25/technology-primer/](https://etherealvalue.wordpress.com/2017/02/25/technology-primer/)

I started by looking at the S&amp;P500 since the early 1900s to understand if there was a mental model I could use to outperform the index. What I found was that starting in the late 1800s, most of the companies that ended up creating enormous shareholder value started as technology companies. Dupont was a technology company in the 1800s, Edison Electric was a technology company in the 1900s, GM was a technology company in the 1920s. If one looks at the market capitalization of companies today, many of the largest are today’s technology companies: Google, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft have market capitalizations which eclipse many old traditional industries.

There is clearly something about technology companies that allows them to generate enormous shareholder value and create wealth for society, after all, if the stock index was still dominated by the likes of American Cotton Oil and American Sugar Refining like in the 1900s, we would all be living in a different and much poorer world. The challenge with investing in technology companies is that for every Edison Electric there is a Zenith Radio. for every IBM there is a Sinclaire Rearch and for every Apple there is a Blackberry. There had to be a way to analyze or put into context why some companies last longer than others and why some managed to generate returns over a thousand fold for its investors while others fizzile and pop with the latest turn in the economic cycle.

I agree with Peter Thiel’s thesis that technology advancement is probably slowing down and primarily concentrated around information technology as a result of regulations around the “world of stuff”. I believe this will continue to be the trend of the next 20-30 years, with some exceptions and that the rise of AI may start creating innovation again in many static fields. I believe historically, there were massive innovation happening across multiple disciplines from the 1800s-1950s, where technological progress branched  out like a tree and built on itself. Since the 1970s or so, this branch narrowed  into only a few sectors, primarily focused in information technology.

So I wanted to strip out the massive amount innovations that have taken place around agriculture, communications, transportation, energy and petrochemicals over the past 100 years. It is helpful to think backwards if you will, focusing on just the age of computers and back into the late 1800s, into the birth of the electronic age. When we focus on just the computer led revolution in the 1950s and electricity revolution in the 1870s, we start seeing some interesting trends.

**Information Technology Cycles**

The following is my attempt at describing from a very high level the history of computing and informational technology. What I found was that technology moves both in cycles of proliferation and consolidation and that there is a directional theme.

Electronic Age

**Electricity/Scaled Power (1875-1900):** Platform competition and consolidation phase: Edison vs Tesla. Enterprise facing, originally to convince government and factory owners to replace physical labor.(Important companies: GE and Westinghouse)

**Electronics (1900-1925):** Electricity prices fall as infrastructure rollout, creating a proliferation of electronic hobbyists and startups. Hardware dominates first half, platform dominates next half. Consumer Facing.(Important companies: RCA, Zenith, Galvin (Motorola), most went belly up, upstream and downstream do well)

**Electronics Consolidation (1925-1950):** The electronics sector consolidates, with content platform operators (software) dominating, and winners usually emerge from previously niche targets.(Important companies: AT&amp;T, NBC, IBM)

Computing/Software Age

**Computing/Scaled Electronic (1950-1975):** Platform consolidation: IBM and the seven dwarfs. Enterprise facing, originally to convince government and large scale enterprise to replace  basic mental labor.(Important companies: IBM)

**From Hardware to Software (1975-2000):** Computing price falls, creating a proliferation of hobbyists, IT startups and companies. Lots of PC makers who go bust, software and internet dominate in the second half.(Important companies: Intel, Microsoft, Apple, Dell, most early PC makers go belly up, up and downstream do well)

**Software Consolidation (2000-2025):** Sectors like Retail, information and social consolidate. Hardware continues to fall away to software as content platform start to dominate, winner is emerging across multiple sub verticals.(Important companies: Amazon, Apple, Alibaba, Tencent)

Cloud/AI Age

**Machine Learning (ML)/Smart Software (2025-2050):** Platform consolidation phase. Enterprise facing, convince companies this is the future of advanced mental labor. It will be about the use of AI at the industrial scale being adapted by corporations and governments for various analytical, resource management and decision making processes.(Candidate Important companies\*\*:\*\* AWS, Microsoft, Palantir, companies yet to exist in China)

**Specialized AI (2050-2075):** Machine learning/AI becomes cheaper, creating a proliferation of AI hobbyists and developers, high level programing focused, consumer facing. This will be about the proliferation of AI in our everyday lives. Just as how starting in the 1990s, the story of technology was one with the integration of computers and software to our daily lives, to some extent, outsourcing the memory/logic processing components of our lives to computers. Now, we will be calling upon multiple AIs to do many deal of the functions of our lives in perhaps faster input times (using neural interfaces). Companies and products could be formed in seconds from simply thinking through the process and outsourcing it to smart software who functionally construct its various parts in second to minutes depending on how quickly you can direct and scale your digital minions to do your bidding.(Candidate important companies: most will go bust, up and downstream will likely do well.)

**General AI (2075-2100):** Consolidation of Software/AI. It will be about the web linkages of human/AI integration. Whether this looks like some sort of neural net where we live in a web of information buffeted by our web of AI advisors.

The average core technology cycle seems to be approximately 75 years, with 25 years of infrastructure platform competition and roll-out, 25 years of new venture creation most of which gets washed out, and 25 years of industry consolidation.

The initial phase of the cycle is dominated by 1-3 players fighting it out in a standards war that then gets rolled out as the foundational infrastructure of the next 50 years:

In the initial phase, the general theme is that the companies start off as enterprise and government facing. In the historical electronics and computer cycle, there has been two such periods, the roll out of electrical grid by GE/Westinghouse and the roll out of mainframe computers by IBM. In the case of the AC vs DC standard war between Edison and Tesla, both men through their respective backers, GE and Westinghouse, to invent and supply standardized power equipment and build power plant, the initial consumers were local government to replace previous gas lamp systems with electrical street lamps and to factories. The new technology was seen as cheaper and more efficient than previously gas operated lambs operated by cities and more importantly, electricity delivered by wire is seen as much more efficient than having onsite power for factory operators, allowing for the displacement of onsite steam engines and boilers. The birth of the mainframe computer was similar, although less competitive. Due to an earlier lead and first mover position, IBM was able to dominate the market over its competitors, making them irrelevant. The mainframe computer was sold to large corporations and government defense agencies for the calculation of complex formulas that had previously required the employment of hundreds of staff. The two initial cycles produce two monopolistic businesses that are still DOW components today, GE and IBM, which set the standard for a drop in the price of electricity and computing that would benefit the next phase of the cycle.

The proliferation phase, the general theme is that there is a cheapening of the previous platform technology, electricity and computing power, which enables hobbyists to take advantage and start building new products in the electronics and PC space. This is characterized by period of high new firm creation, high levels of creativity and a move from enterprise focus to the consumer. We saw it in the 1900-1920s with the birth of the electronics industry, there were dozens of radio makers, appliance makers and various electronics manufacturing startups. During this time, there was heavy competition from the host of new hardware businesses, with most profits coming from IP licensing. A similar analogy could be made of the PC era of the 1980s-2000s, there was a lot of hardware makers, it was highly competitive, and the winners of the era were primarily focusing on software (ie Microsoft).

The consolidation phase, In the case of the 1920s, the commoditization of hardware created an opportunity for content providers. History is littered with names of large scale manufacturer that are now defuct, names like Zenith, admiral and dozens of electronics makers which use to hover mid-western industrial hubs such as Chicago. The content providers in Radio and TV became more dominant. Through the current consolidation phase, starting in 2000, we see less new venture creation and generally a focus on the content/distribution platform side of consumer technology. Amazon, Netflix, Google, Apple are key examples of the shift.

What it means today,

I would argue that we are in the consolidation part of the cycle until 2020-2025, where it will continue to be about shrinking number of consumer technology players and the dominance of content over infrastructure. This explains the phenomenal increase of FANG stocks relative to the rest of the market. As a result, for the next 5-10 years, if one can pick good entry points for Amazon (I will discuss my dislike of Google in a future post), one will be successful, and the company will likely last for a long time. It remains to be seen if Apple can create a bigger ecosystem. Contrarian value plays probably revolve around Chinese ADRs which are out of favor with the US public.

**From 2025 onward, the most exciting prospect is the idea of a repeat of the infrastructure buildout that happened at the onset of the electricity and computing age. I believe that the new phase will be targeting enterprise and government and will be a winner take all fight similar to the few cycles. The previous cycles revolved around scaled mechanical energy and scaled linear mental processing, I believe the next phase will revolve around advanced mental processing. I think that corporations and government while benefiting from scale, are beholden to inefficient decision making due to complicated management structuring.** The automation of complex management process that can analyze of complex large data and deploy resources more efficiently will become invaluable to large corporate/government clients. Companies that have potential in this space are big data players with big client channels like AWS and **Palantir** or emergent players which have yet to develop in the US or China. It is also possible that will come from a spinout team from one of current tech giants.

It is a serious mistake to continue to look for consumer plays in the technology space. I believe that the sector is consolidating and played out. New entrants will find it nearly impossible to survive at the downturn of the next cycle and current incumbents will solidity their positioning. The next batch of potentially interesting companies will likely come from the enterprise space. While Wall Street analysts continues to be focused on AWS and the fight over IaaS and PaaS, the most interesting segment to watch is in advanced analytics and resource allocation tools, which is ripe for innovation. There are lots of fat in the middle management layer of corporations and governments. I strongly believe that this space is where the next once in a generation infrastructure player (like GE and IBM) can offer an impressive solution which will fill the niche. The early identification of this company/companies will generate significant out performance relative to any market benchmark.

2020 Update:

If we are in the infrastructure roll-out stage than first mover absolutely has an advantage as we could see with GE, IBM and microsoft to some extent during the previous eras. In the consolidation ages, the last mover had an advantage. Amazon and Apple were not the first e-commerce or hardware makers, but are likely the last because they benefit from  a slow down of technology and a focus on ease of use and scale.  This is why every contract and sticky ones PLTR has is so important, because these relationships will scale in a non-linear way once AI and machine learning starts making its way into  large institutions and first mover advantage is very very important here, just like how GE was working around the clock to sign on factories and local governments for lighting and electricity contracts, once they were in, that is forever and they could start selling other equipment and devices all of which were collecting licensing or patent fees.

I have very high conviction on Palantir.  I believe the reason above is what drove Peter Thiel to invest into Palantir, because it is building the infrastructure layer for the age of AI and PLTR is primed to becoming the single most important company in technology for the next 2-3 decades and will be a 100-1,000x bagger.

53,DELL,Weekend IV Report - Tickers with low IV and cheap premiums,"What's up fellas at Options. I made a tool called [FD Ranker](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/fd-ranker) that logs the average IV of popular tickers. The tool is inclusive of almost 1,000 tickers now.

**What is this tool good for**

I posted in ThetaGang the list with HIGH IV options which is great for running the wheel or selling options. This list is an inverse of that list and displays tickers where IV is pretty low, thus, purchasing calls will likely be cheaper. For example, AAPL implied volatility right now is almost back to the pre-March lows. Remember a low IV can go lower and a high IV can go higher. Do your DD before entering any positions!

118,DELL,Corsair Gaming ($CRSR) Short DD,"I believe there are many retail investors diving into meme stocks before doing any due diligence at all due to FOMO, just like myself. I'm now trying to be more responsible with my money so I started doing short research reports on the business models of stocks expecting it will help me identify potential multibaggers to buy and hold for the long term. I thought I'd begin sharing, hoping it will help some of you too, as well as benefiting myself from your thoughts and comments.

The write up is informational rather than analytic, and its purpose is to help you reach your own conclusions instead of telling you what to do.

Please let me know if there is anything that can make future write ups more useful.

# Corsair Gaming ($CRSR)

*Redefining gaming, eSports, and streaming*

They acquired Elgato Gaming in 2018 to expand to the streaming gear market, Origin PC and SCUF gaming in 2019 to expand into the custom-built PC systems and console controllers markets, respectively, and during 2020 they acquired Gamer Sensei and EpocCam, and partnered with Pipeline to grow into the gaming and streaming coaching market.

Corsair went public on September 23, 2020, with its IPO priced at $17, valuing the company at about $1.3B.

# Industry

**Market Size**

According to Jon Peddie Research, the global gaming and streaming gear markets is expected to reach $40B by the end of 2020. Before the pandemic JPR estimated the market to grow at a modest 1.05% CAGR until 2022. However, during 2020 the market has grown an estimated 10% year-over-year.

Additionally, DFC Intelligence research estimated that the video-game coaching market surpasses $1B.

**Industry Fundamentals**

Growth in the gaming and streaming gear industries are driven by strong and robust fundamentals.

Popularity of gaming is increasing:

According to Newzoo, there are an estimated 2.7B gamers worldwide, which are expected to spend $159B on games in 2020 and is expected to grow at an 8.3% CAGR to exceed $200B by 2023. PC and console gaming represents 51% of the total market, and mobile gaming 49%. Corsair has stated that currently there is no interest in expanding to the mobile gaming market.

Tech-driven improvements in game quality:

Advances in computer power have enabled gaming platforms to provide increasingly immersive experiences. This in turn, places increased demand on high-performance computing hardware.

Increasing gaming and streaming engagement:

Some interesting facts reported in the Limelight Networks’ State of Online Gaming 2019 research report include:

* On average, video gamers spend six hours and 20 minutes each week playing video games
* More than 38% of gamers would like to become professionals if it could support themselves
* Gamers from novice to aspiring professionals report missing daily activities due to gaming, missed sleep is the most pervasive
* Watching gamers play video games online is more popular than watching traditional sports for 18-25 year olds.

**The eSports and streaming flywheel**

The rise in popularity and viewership of eSports brings more investment from publishers, sponsors, advertisers, team owners, and leagues to the eSports industry. Increased investment brings more players and increased performance focus of gamers who advance from less engaged gaming to high-performance gameplay, which in turn brings more viewers.

# Competitive Landscape &amp; Risks

**Competition**

The gaming and streaming market is characterized by intense competition, constant price pressure and rapid change. Competition across Corsair’s product offering includes:

**Gaming keyboards and mice** \- Logitech and Razer

**Headsets and related audio products** \-Logitech, Razer, and HyperX

**Streaming gear** \- Logitech and AVerMedia

**Performance controllers** \- Microsoft and Logitech

**PSUs, cooling solutions, and computer cases** \- Cooler Master, NZXT, EVGA, Seasonic, and Thermaltake

**High performance memory** \- G.Skill, HyperX, and Micron

**Pre-built and custom-built gaming PCs** \- Alienware (Dell), Omen (HP), Asus, Razer, iBuypower and Cyberpower

**Competitive Strategy**

The company follows a differentiation leadership strategy by prioritizing high-performance and professional quality and charging a price premium on their products in exchange for superior quality, high value added features, and superior brand recognition.

**Market Share**

According to NPD Group, by 2020 Corsair had #1 market share position in the US in its gaming components and systems products with 42% of the market share from 26% in 2015. Their gamer and creator peripheral products are not yet market leaders, however, the company increased its market share in that segment from 5% in 2013 to 18% by 2020 in the US.

**Growth Strategy**

Move into the Asia Pacific region:

The Asia Pacific Region represents a long-term growth opportunity. According to Newzoo, they represent 54% of the global gaming community.

Complimentary acquisitions:

Corsair has carried out this strategy aggressively since 2018 with the acquisitions of Elgato Gaming, Origin PC, SCUF and Gamer Sensei. They plan to continue evaluating and pursuing new acquisitions that may strengthen their competitive position.

New Markets:

Uses of streaming gear has spread into areas including, podcasting, video blogging, interactive fitness, remote learning, and work-from-home, which represent a promising avenue for continued expansion in this product segment.

**Threat of New Entrants**

Because of the continued convergence between the computing devices and consumer electronics markets, increased competition from well-established consumer electronics companies is expected in the gaming and streaming peripherals segment (e.g. use of Audio-technica microphones by streamers).

**Threat of Substitution**

A significant medium- to long-term risk for Corsair’s business model is the evolution of cloud computing and augmented/virtual reality entertainment.

Cloud computing refers to a computing environment in which software is run on third-party servers and accessed by end users over the internet, requiring minimal processing power from the end-user’s system. Through cloud computing, gamers will be able to access and play sophisticated games without the need of expensive high-performance PC systems and components.

According to Grand View Research, the global cloud gaming market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 48% from 2020 to reach $7.2B by 2027.

Additionally, Corsair must be able to adapt its product offering to meet the needs of the evolving augmented/virtual reality industry.

**Moats**

There does not seem to be any relevant, structural moats, that may prohibit competitors from capturing Corsair’s market share across their product offering.

**Other Relevant Risks**

Due to the concentration of their production facilities in Taiwan and China, Corsair may be adversely by geopolitical tensions and trade disputes.

**Case for Buying**

Industry fundamentals and growth:

You envision that through Corsair’s competitive strategy and management’s ability to adapt they will be able to grow, or at least maintain, their market share and global footprint in the gaming components, systems, and peripherals industry which shows promising fundamentals and growth as gaming, eSports, and streaming continue to gain significant relevance globally.

The company follows a differentiation leadership strategy by prioritizing high-performance and professional quality and charging a price premium on their products in exchange for superior quality, high value added features, and superior brand recognition.

**Market Share**

According to NPD Group, by 2020 Corsair had #1 market share position in the US in its gaming components and systems products with 42% of the market share from 26% in 2015. Their gamer and creator peripheral products are not yet market leaders, however, the company increased its market share in that segment from 5% in 2013 to 18% by 2020 in the US.

**Growth Strategy**

Move into the Asia Pacific region:

The Asia Pacific Region represents a long-term growth opportunity. According to Newzoo, they represent 54% of the global gaming community.

Complimentary acquisitions:

Corsair has carried out this strategy aggressively since 2018 with the acquisitions of Elgato Gaming, Origin PC, SCUF and Gamer Sensei. They plan to continue evaluating and pursuing new acquisitions that may strengthen their competitive position.

New Markets:

Uses of streaming gear has spread into areas including, podcasting, video blogging, interactive fitness, remote learning, and work-from-home, which represent a promising avenue for continued expansion in this product segment.

**Threat of New Entrants**

Because of the continued convergence between the computing devices and consumer electronics markets, increased competition from well-established consumer electronics companies is expected in the gaming and streaming peripherals segment (e.g. use of Audio-technica microphones by streamers).

**Threat of Substitution**

A significant medium- to long-term risk for Corsair’s business model is the evolution of cloud computing and augmented/virtual reality entertainment.

Cloud computing refers to a computing environment in which software is run on third-party servers and accessed by end users over the internet, requiring minimal processing power from the end-user’s system. Through cloud computing, gamers will be able to access and play sophisticated games without the need of expensive high-performance PC systems and components.

According to Grand View Research, the global cloud gaming market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 48% from 2020 to reach $7.2B by 2027.

Additionally, Corsair must be able to adapt its product offering to meet the needs of the evolving augmented/virtual reality industry.

**Moats**

There does not seem to be any relevant, structural moats, that may prohibit competitors from capturing Corsair’s market share across their product offering.

**Other Relevant Risks**

Due to the concentration of their production facilities in Taiwan and China, Corsair may be adversely by geopolitical tensions and trade disputes.

**For the 9 months ended September 2020 compared to the same period last year:**

The 49% increase in net revenue is mostly attributed to a large number of consumers gaming and working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The company’s gross margin is influenced by its product mix for the period, gamer and creator peripherals have a higher gross margin (25-35%) than gaming components and systems (15-25%).

# Investment Outlook

**Case for Buying**

Industry fundamentals and growth:

You envision that through Corsair’s competitive strategy and management’s ability to adapt they will be able to grow, or at least maintain, their market share and global footprint in the gaming components, systems, and peripherals industry which shows promising fundamentals and growth as gaming, eSports, and streaming continue to gain significant relevance globally.

**Case for Selling**

Market structure, threat of new entrants and lack of moats:

If you believe that Corsair will not be able to maintain their competitive position in a highly fragmented market with intense competition and without significant structural moats.

Cloud computing and gaming:

If you think that cloud computing will gain widespread adoption in the medium to long-term, significantly reducing the need for consumers of purchasing high-performance systems and components.

201,DELL,"VMware (VMW) Exploit Chaining in Combination with SolarWinds (SWI), What Does It Mean for Investors? CVE-2020-13169 and CVE-2020-14005","**TLDR**

The first impact on VMware (VMW) was Friday when Brian Krebs (World renowned Cyber Security Investigative Reporter known for highly effective campaigns in tracking and neutralizing cybercriminal threats) tied the SolarWinds (SWI) based hacks to the VMware vulnerabilities reported by the NSA. This combination of capabilities explains persistence and how it was formed.

VMware (VMW) dropped 5.6% by end of day after the publication of the Krebs article.

[https://www.barrons.com/articles/vmware-stock-falls-as-report-links-its-software-to-solarwinds-hack-51608327990](https://www.barrons.com/articles/vmware-stock-falls-as-report-links-its-software-to-solarwinds-hack-51608327990)

Patches already exist but VMware has found itself thrown into the fire of the SolarWinds hack. At this point since VMware was not a victim, but instead a utility, they may find themselves following the downward path of SolarWinds as the reputation of their Identity Management products takes a beating. 5.6% may be the beginning of a weeks long drop as customers reassess their ties to VMware identity management products and investors panic on the correlation to the SolarWinds hack.

**What is VMware?**

VMware provides the worlds premier virtualization software. ""VMware, Inc. engages in the provision of cloud infrastructure and business mobility. Its products include Software-Defined Data Center, Hybrid Cloud Computing, and End-User Computing. It supports modernizing data centers, integrating public clouds, empowering digital workspaces and transforming security."" -Forbes

**Who uses VMware?**

""More than 500,000 customers of all sizes have chosen VMware as their virtualization platform, including

• 99 percent of Fortune 100 companies  
• 99 percent of Fortune 500 companies  
• 100 percent of Fortune Global 100 companies • 99 percent of Fortune Global 500 companies""

VMware is also GSA approved and distributed through Dell (DELL), Carahsoft, and Ingram Micro/Promark and used by all levels of government and the US military.

[https://www.vmware.com/solutions/industry/government/federal-government-it-solutions.html](https://www.vmware.com/solutions/industry/government/federal-government-it-solutions.html)

**Who discovered the latest VMware vulnerabilities?**

The vulnerabilities were disclosed to VMware by the NSA. VMware subsequently disclosed to the public.

**What was the major exploit within VMware products?**

""A malicious actor with network access to the administrative configurator on port 8443 and a valid password for the configurator admin account can execute commands with unrestricted privileges on the underlying operating system.""

[https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2020-0027.html](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2020-0027.html)

**How would someone be able to accomplish the exploit?**

You may be asking, how could someone accomplish a login to the administrative port of a VMware configuration with a valid password?

Well this is simple, SolarWinds Orion stores and utilizes the adequate credentials to monitor and maintain all devices placed within it's scope......including your VMware entities.

[https://documentation.solarwinds.com/en/Success\_Center/orionplatform/Content/Core-Adding-VMware-Servers-for-Monitoring-sw89.htm](https://documentation.solarwinds.com/en/Success_Center/orionplatform/Content/Core-Adding-VMware-Servers-for-Monitoring-sw89.htm)

**So the VMware has been compromised, what can they really do?**

Through VMware Workspace One Access and VMware Identity Manager the actor is able to create unauthorized but VALID SAML tokens which enable authentication to network resources. Once an administrative level authentication is established to resources such as Active Directory the actor is able to create persistence.

""It is critical when running products that perform authentication that the server and all the services that depend on it are properly configured for secure operation and integration. Otherwise, SAML assertions could be forged, granting access to numerous resources. If integrating authentication servers with ADFS, NSA recommends following Microsoft’s best practices, especially for securing SAML assertions and requiring multi-factor authentication""

[https://media.defense.gov/2020/Dec/07/2002547071/-1/-1/0/CSA\_VMWARE%20ACCESS\_U\_OO\_195076\_20.PDF](https://media.defense.gov/2020/Dec/07/2002547071/-1/-1/0/CSA_VMWARE%20ACCESS_U_OO_195076_20.PDF)

**But did it really happen this way? Were the exploits chained?**

It seems so from all assessments. For all authenticators that could not be harvested from within SolarWinds, in the condition of existence of VMware Workspace One Access and VMware Identity Manager served as the final hurdle to full domain control.

""The exploitation occurs after the actors have gained initial access to a victim’s on-premises network. The actors leverage privileged access in the on-premises environment to subvert the mechanisms that the organization uses to grant access to cloud and on-premises resources and/or to compromise administrator credentials with the ability to manage cloud resources.""

""In the first Tactics Techniques and Procedures, the actors compromise on-premises components of a federated SSO infrastructure and steal the credential or private key that is used to sign Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) tokens (TA00061, T1552, T1552.004). Using the private keys, the actors then forge trusted authentication tokens to access cloud resources. A recent NSA Cybersecurity Advisory warned of actors exploiting a vulnerability in VMware Access®2 and VMware Identity Manager®3 that allowed them to perform this Tactics Techniques and Procedures and abuse federated SSO infrastructure""

""Regardless of how the initial on-premises compromise occurred, detecting authentication abuse can aid in detecting the compromise and even contain it if responded to quickly enough. The recent SolarWinds Orion®9 code compromise is one serious example of how on-premises systems can be compromised leading to abuse of federated authentication and malicious cloud access""

[https://media.defense.gov/2020/Dec/17/2002554125/-1/-1/0/AUTHENTICATION\_MECHANISMS\_CSA\_U\_OO\_198854\_20.PDF](https://media.defense.gov/2020/Dec/17/2002554125/-1/-1/0/AUTHENTICATION_MECHANISMS_CSA_U_OO_198854_20.PDF)

**Why would this shift VMware (VMW) stock price down if there is already a patch?**

VMware has gone from having patched an exploit disclosed to them by the NSA, to having been placed in the spotlight of previous and current utility by those that exploited the SolarWinds hack.

The NSA had already written very detailed documentation of how the VMware and SolarWinds exploits chained together but it had not proven digestible to most.

After Krebs wrote his article it brought up questions within consumers of VMware products of why they needed their version of identify as a service (IDaaS) for their single sign-on. This sentiment moved forward into investors and we saw a 5.6% drop in VMware (VMW) stock by end of day.

It is highly likely that as SolarWinds falls on news of the hack that now that VMware has been identified in the same exploit chain they may fall with it.

WMware thankfully were quick to disclose their own vulnerability, and none of their board attempted to exit their positions before that disclosure. This is the opposite of what had been done by SolarWinds, with whom they have now been linked by technical means.

We may see a further fall in VMware stock price on Monday and throughout the upcoming weeks as a result of the above information.

**Updates will come.**

As updates become available they will be posted here, either as edits or links to independent posts.

This post welcomes comments both technical and layman’s level. Original posting has been made for the layman but open to questions to dig deeper.",52,30,1608478860.0,2020-12-20T15:41:00+00:00,t3_kgw2ms,wallstreetbets

This list is an inverse of that list and displays tickers where IV is pretty low, thus, purchasing calls will likely be cheaper. For example, AAPL implied volatility right now is near the lows and almost back to the pre-March lows. Remember a low IV can go lower and a high IV can go higher. Do your DD before entering any positions!

If you guys find this list useful (it's my first time posting this here), I can make this a weekly/weekend thing. I like doing it on Sundays so I can prepare for the trading week ahead.

# Low IV Tickers List

\*Some of the market cap data is off, so always double check before entering any plays! Also, the ""next earnings date"" data will resume starting in January, 2021 (very soon).

Please note this list is only inclusive of the more popular tickers mentioned around Reddit. If you want to see the full list and filter by ticker, check out the tool in the link at the top.

If you find it useful I can post an updated list every Sunday while you guys prepare your plays for the week.

29,DELL,APXT // AvePoint - Legit Analysis,"Read first, thank me later. **AvePoint, the Largest Microsoft 365 Data Management Solutions Provider, Announced a $2bn Merger in a definite business combination with Apex Technology Acquisition Corporation** (NASDAQ: APXT). The post-closing entity will be listed on NASDAQ under new ticker AVPT and maintain the AvePoint name. The transaction has been approved by the Board of Directors of Apex, as well as the Board of Directors of AvePoint and it is expected to finalise in Q1 2021

**// About AvePoint**

AvePoint is the largest data management solutions provider for the Microsoft cloud, with over 1,300 employees in 29 global offices. Key takeaway:

* AvePoint was founded in 2001 as a company to help ease the complexity of SharePoint installations, which at the time were all on-premise. Today, it has adapted to the shift to the cloud as a SaaS tool and primarily acts as a policy layer enabling companies to make sure employees are using these tools in a compliant way
* Huge diversified blue-chip client base, \~7 million members (as of Sep 30, 2020) with 16k accounts and 25% of Fortune 500 using the company’s services. 7M users represent 3% or 250M Microsoft 365 client base with an estimated addressable market of $33 billion by 2022 (according to IDC). The Company sells directly to large and mid-market enterprises, and its solutions are also available to managed services providers on more than 100 cloud marketplaces globally. Regarding Microsoft, the company “Bridges the Gap Between What Microsoft Cloud Offers and What the Enterprise Requires”
* Compared to other recent SPAC deals and business combinations we just saw, AvePoint has indeed a great track record. Expected 2020 revenues @ USD 148M, a + 26% YoY increase (78% recurring revenues).

99,DELL,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, November 25, 2020. Please enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, November 25, 2020**

After hitting record levels in the Dow and the S&amp;P, the market consolidated its gain, finishing the day even or slightly red. Ahead of the US Thanksgiving holiday, optimism over a relatively quick rollout of a coronavirus vaccine propelled the Dow Jones to above 30,000 points for the first time and the S&amp;P to record highs. The tech-heavy Nasdaq, which has been beaten down recently as market participants rotate to cyclical and reopening stocks also posted a strong week.

Countering the optimism is the reality that the coronavirus pandemic has been surging the last few weeks, raising the specter of further restrictions. As of Tuesday, there 88,080 patients hospitalized with the coronavirus pandemic

Finally, after four painful weeks, the surge in coronavirus infections are showing early signs of improvement. The national weekly average for daily new infections is 172,118, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. While that is an all-time record, it only represents an 11% increase to last week. In the past four weeks, average daily new infections were posting a roughly 30-40% increase every week. The daily average deaths are more than 1,500, similar level to early May.

Today was a slow day, in terms of news. With Thanksgiving coming up, markets are closed tomorrow and open only half-day Friday

The political uncertainty in the United States is beginning to clear up. Weeks after Joe Biden was declared President-Elect, General Service Administration (GSA) head Emily Murphy acknowledged Biden’s win and approved the official transition process. The GSA is a government agency that works largely behind the scenes to support other federal entities, with responsibility for managing federal office space, procuring supplies and improving the use of technology across the government. The GSA provides a presidential transition team with Washington office space and coordinates access to federal agencies to plan potential policy changes with current administration officials, using $6.3 million allocated to support its efforts. This will finally allow Biden’s team to gain access to crucial information needed to effectively govern the nation. Mark Haefele, UBS Global chief investment officer, said, “We believe that the recent reduction in political uncertainty in the U.S., though far from complete, is another supportive factor behind the recent stock rally,

Markets were also encouraged by Biden’s appointment of former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen to Treasury  Secretary. Yellen served as Fed Chair from 2014-2018, helping steer the historic bull market that followed the 2008 recession.

205,DELL,Want to make money? Buy Dell,"Dell has earnings on the morning of Tuesday November 24th. Dell is a computer manufacturer along with other technology such as projectors, notebooks, printers, and headphones. You know what this means, at home working. Along with this part of business, it has a CLOUD portion. Yes this boomer stonk has a cloud business by the name of VMW. This allows them not only to sell computers but have a steady cloud business. VMW ware has shown consistent growth, with an average of 12ish % yoy. Cloud has obvious boomed during Covid-19, so you can assume VMW will have great returns this earnings. In addition for VMW, it has partnered with NVDA to make AI chips better.

Now the PC  sales will be fantastic as shown CSCO, LOGI, and Target. If you did not know all of these companies massively beat earnings. All of them sell computers, headphones, etc. Target is a massive provider for Dell's computers. 

Now I know some people will say Dell = Apple! It will miss!

But, Dell does not sell Iphones and laptops just for money. In addition, Dell is cheaper than Apple. Why would you spend 2k for a new laptop when you have a old one? With Dell, laptops can be under 1000 dollars, and people would want to upgrade for better ones/

They have a 3 sections.

VMW and computer which I covered but they have storage portion too.

I believe that because school came back, many people brought Dell computers and products for stay-at-home. In addition to VMW and storage revenue. Dell's earnings estimates have barely moved since Q2 and it provides for a great beat.

Also NVDA and AMD's new CPU's and GPU's are in Dell's products. If you wanted a new rtx 3070 or rtx 3080, or rtx 3090, you can buy it in a Dell PC. If you just look at AMD's and NVDA's sales you can tell there is great demand for their chips.

Now onto technicals, Dell broke their march uptrend line but has bounced off the lows and created a new uptrend. It is just below ATH which it failed to break 3 months ago. If earnings beats, it could fucking moon 10% or more. Keep in mind that Dell has gone up on past 3-4 earnings.

Now Dell's IV is low , with just 47%. So you will not get IV crushed that badly. Also, it is not a volatile stock, and max moves down are rarely greater than 4%

Also there has been lots of buying for Dell calls, on Friday 1750 12/18c were traded

30,DELL,HPQ short analysis,"I purchased HPQ at $20.61 the other day, and yep, it's dropped a little since then. I'm new to investing, but my thought process feels logical, and I fully plan to put more into this stock, and here are my thoughts.

I initially purchased positions because they are announcing their Q4 earnings on the 24th, and I believe they've done really well this last quarter with sales of laptops from everyone working from home, as well as prolonged lockdowns being announced and less opportunity to begin working in shared spaces. Those who didn't already have a work laptop, definitely do now. To me, HP screams student/business compared to Dell, and other competitors that give off more of a casual use appeal (like Chromebooks).

After purchasing, I stumbled across news that HP is supplying Shutterfly with 60 new digital presses that will use HP Software. I believe more than ever that Shutterfly has seen a boost in revenue because people are holding onto any good memory they can have during this pandemic. You better believe people have opted to print pictures of family members and display them around the home if they don't already, because of limited to no contact. 

Shutterfly also offers a photo album creation service that our family has personally used during Christmas two times now, with amazing results and memories that will last forever. The service is perfect during this pandemic.

It seems to me the stock is undervalued, based on the last few years. It hasn't had a problem staying above $21 up until the pandemic. Even from the pandemic dropping HPQ to $13, the stock recovered quickly back up to $20 as of November. 

That's all I got. Do your DD, I'm trying to do mine!",4,12,1605981929.0,2020-11-21T18:05:29+00:00,t3_jyfcjm,investing
55,DELL,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning November 23rd, 2020","Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 23rd, 2020.

# **Stocks may continue to struggle Thanksgiving week amid Covid-19 outbreaks  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/20/stocks-may-continue-to-struggle-thanksgiving-week-amid-covid-19-outbreaks.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks could continue to struggle with the twin themes of the spreading virus and a potentially robust recovery, once a vaccine is deployed next year.
*****
&gt; In the coming week, the restrictions the spreading virus is imposing on the economy will be clear, when many Americans choose to stay at home over the Thanksgiving Day holiday and partake in much smaller celebrations.
*****
&gt; “On the Covid side, there will be more lockdowns, but I think the message is loud and clear. ‘People: Don’t be cavalier around Thanksgiving,’” said Tom Lee, founder of Fundstrat. Thanksgiving traditionally kicks off the holiday shopping season, an important time of the year for the economy which could be hobbled by Covid. The U.S. reported 182,000 new cases Thursday.
*****
&gt; Lee said the market will continue to feel the push pull of the drag from the pandemic against the promise of recovery, seen in the rebound of cyclical stocks. Cyclical sectors industrials and materials were both up about 1% for the week, and financials were up a half percent. But tech and communications, both big tech and growth sectors that benefited from the stay-at-home trade, were lower.
*****
&gt; “I think stocks are kind of consolidating and maybe it’s going to go on for a couple of days,” Lee said. He added that stocks could start to perk up late in the week, and investors are expecting stocks to head higher into year end. “The cyclicals have held up like champs, and the small caps, and value have been really holding up,” Lee said.
*****
&gt; Stocks were mixed in the past week, with the Dow and S&amp;P 500 slightly lower, and the Nasdaq up 0.2%. The Russell 2000 was the star performer, with a gain of 2.4% for the week. The Russell is up 16% since the beginning of October.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P shot up sharply on Nov. 9 when Pfizer announced its vaccine as 95% effective, but it never regained that intraday high of 3,645 and has since traded in a sideways pattern. The S&amp;P 500 closed at 3,557 Friday, down 0.8% for the week.
*****
&gt; JPMorgan economists warned Friday that the “winter will be grim” and they forecast that the restrictions due to the virus will drag on the economy, resulting in a negative first quarter. They expect a strong rebound in the second and third quarter, once the vaccine is distributed and an anticipated fiscal stimulus program takes hold.
*****
&gt; “It’s hard for some investors to look over that period and see the recovery. I think this is where we are now,” said Katie Nixon, Northern Trust Wealth Management CIO. She said the concern is how much damage the restrictions will do as the virus spreads at a record rate. “This is happening and with exponential force right now. It’s just shocking to see the numbers and how state and local authorities are trying to deal with it in a variety of ways.”
*****
&gt; But Nixon said she’s very positive on the market longer term, and the economy will heal once the vaccine becomes available. She said fiscal stimulus from Washington would help.
*****
&gt; Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell signaled he would again discuss a package with Democrats, and that funds that were being used for Fed programs could be diverted to a fiscal package.
*****
&gt; The Treasury Thursday indicated it would not continue five of the Fed’s emergency program from when they expire at year end, surprising some in the markets. The Fed objected, but the markets took the development in stride, as traders expect the programs to be reinstated if financial conditions warrant it.
*****
&gt; The Fed releases the minutes of its last meeting Wednesday afternoon, and that could be important as traders are watching to see if the central bank reveals any detail of discussions on potential changes to its asset buying program. There is widespread speculation the Fed could tweak its $80 billion Treasury buying program at the December meeting to include more longer duration notes and bonds, a move that should hold down already low long-term rates.
*****
&gt; Also in the week ahead, there is some key data including personal income and spending and durable goods on Wednesday. Consumer confidence is Tuesday and consumer sentiment is released Wednesday. There are also a few Fed speakers, who will be watched closely for any comments on the expiring programs.
*****
&gt; Any word on fiscal stimulus talks will get market attention, though there is skepticism anything will before next year. If a package is not passed, the unemployment benefits going to 12 million Americans will end at the end of December, and mortgage forbearance will end. Bank of America economists said if there is no stimulus package to prevent these things, there would be a 1.5 percentage point drag on first quarter growth.
*****
&gt; “The biggest thing we need to do is prevent bankruptcies and prevent unemployment from rising,” Nixon said. She said the labor market has stalled, and it is important to avoid the deep scarring from bankruptcies.
*****
&gt; She said it is not too late for investors to get in on the rotation into growth,and some investors are worried they didn’t get in on time. “Value has so much to go to catch up on growth,” she said.

&gt; # The Thanksgiving Trade

&gt; Trading around Thanksgiving has a bullish tendency perhaps buoyed by the “holiday spirit.” First published in the 1987 Stock Trader’s Almanac, the Wednesday before and the Friday after Thanksgiving combined were up 34 times in 35 years. The only S&amp;P 500 decline was in 1964.

&gt; Subsequently, this trend changed. In the 33 years since 1987, there have been 9 declines and 24 advances. The best short-term trade appears to be getting long into any weakness on Monday or Tuesday of Thanksgiving week and selling into any subsequent rally by the end of Thanksgiving week. But as COVID-19 cases are on the rise again remain nimble as exogenous events like Greece’s debt crisis in 2011 or 2018’s fourth quarter rout can cancel Thanksgiving on Wall Street.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/b5ce4af9292059c4d14b95baeef02b2c/d8ddf7af01919e17-07/s1280x1920/c4a8ff5b8e431b28dd3e24654e98204861afd94d.jpg))**

&gt; Also of note is the change in the yearend rally. Prior to 1987, from the close of trading on the Friday after Thanksgiving to yearend, the S&amp;P 500 rallied only 20 times in 35 years. As Thanksgiving bullishness lost steam in 1987, the rally afterwards occurred more frequently. Since 1987, S&amp;P 500 has logged gains in 25 of 33 years from the close on Friday after Thanksgiving to yearend.

&gt; # 5 Noteworthy Charts To Watch As Stocks Soar

&gt; First, the big economic data point this week was retail sales. Although the headline number was a little light at 0.3% versus an expected 0.5% gain month-over-month, it still hit another new all-time high along the way (source: US Census Bureau). “The miss could be a sign the consumer is finally starting to slow amid record COVID-19 cases and more restrictions, with restaurant sales dipping for the first time since April,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

&gt; The good news is retail sales has hit a new high for five consecutive months, and the economy has never been in a recession after three consecutive new highs—yet another sign the recession may be over, even if it hasn’t been called officially.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.18.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; How strong has the recent rally been? Well, as of Tuesday’s close, the S&amp;P 500 Index was on pace to have its second-best month of November ever. November isn’t over yet of course, but this could open the door to a potential late-month snap back lower after a huge move, which would be perfectly normal and healthy.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.18.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; After Monday’s record close, the S&amp;P 500 now has 24 new all-time high closes in 2020.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.18.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; The surge after the election was historic in many ways. The number of stocks in the S&amp;P 500 recently making new monthly highs caught our attention. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, previous surges in new monthly highs opened the door for near-term weakness, but the weakness was a nice buying opportunity. In fact, a year after previous major breadth thrusts saw stocks higher every single time, not something we want to ignore.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.18.20-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Last, more than 85% of the stocks in the S&amp;P 500 recently were above their 200-day moving average—another sign of impressive participation in this recent market strength. Once again, future results would suggest this extreme strength is a sign of potential future strong performance and weakness could be used as a buying opportunity.

&gt; # B.I.G. Tips - Retail Sales Slow

&gt; The October Retail Sales report missed expectations this morning on both a headline and core basis. In addition to the weaker than expected reading for October, September's report was also revised lower.

&gt; Breadth in this month’s report was also negative for the first time since April. Of the thirteen sectors tracked in the report, just five showed growth while eight declined. On the positive side, Non-Store retail was the main bright spot with m/m growth of 3.11%. That’s the last thing every traditional retailer wants to hear and could be indicative of another wave of retrenchment on the part of consumers as the weather gets colder and case counts rise. Electronics and Appliances also reported strong sales growth likely aided by the launch of the iPhone 12. On the downside, Clothing and Sporting Goods both saw m/m declines of over 4%, while sales at General Merchandise retailers dropped 1.1%.

&gt; While the monthly pace of retail sales is back at all-time highs, the characteristics behind the total level of sales have changed markedly in the post COVID world. In our just-released B.I.G. Tips report, we looked at these changing dynamics to highlight the groups that have been the biggest winners and losers from the shifts.

&gt; # Finally A New High for Small Caps

&gt; It only took over two years, but the Russell 2000 finally put in a new all-time high on Friday. As shown in the charts below, Friday marked the first all-time high on a closing basis since August 31st, 2018; a total of 553 trading days between highs. As shown in the second chart below, since the index began trading in the late 80's, that makes for the third-longest stretch without a new high. The only two longer periods were from March 10th, 2000 through April 2nd, 2004 and from July 16, 2007 through April 26th, 2011. Both of those streaks were nearly twice as long as the past two years' streak.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111620-R2000.png))**

&gt; The Russell 2000 is up another 2% to more fresh highs this morning, but the recent move to new highs has left the index very overbought. As shown in the snapshot of our Trend Analyzer below, at Friday's close small caps like the Russell 2000 (IWM) and Core S&amp;P Small-Cap ETF (IJR) are two of the most overbought major index ETFs after having seen some of the strongest performance over the past five days. Granted, as other large-cap indices like the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) were quicker to return to all-time highs earlier this year making them some of the stronger performers on the year, small caps have been laggards on a year to date basis. In other words, this year's weakest performers have been a factor in recent strength. Click here to view Bespoke's premium membership options for our best research available.

&gt; # A Month for the Ages

&gt; Just when you think you've seen it all from this market, a month like November comes around. Stock returns so far this month have been extraordinary, and what makes the gains even more impressive is the fact that they came not from a starting point of a depressed bear-market environment but instead from a level that was already pretty close to record highs. Within the Russell 3000, which encompasses stocks with market caps of all sizes, the average MTD performance of stocks in the index is a gain of over 15%. Even in the large-cap S&amp;P 500, the average stock in the index has rallied more than 13.5% so far this month! Keep in mind too that these are just averages, and plenty of individual stocks are up multiples of that.

&gt; In the Russell 3000, there are 51 stocks that are up over 50% so far in November. We don't have enough room to list them all, but the first table below shows the twenty top performers. Topping the list is Five Prime Therapeutics (FPRX), which has rallied more than 349% this month! That's years worth of returns in sixteen days. Behind FPRX, there are two other stocks - Cooper Standard (CPS) and Revlon (REV) - which have both more than doubled. Many of the names listed below are unknown small caps, but a handful of names like Transocean (RIG), Coty (COTY), and Lyft (LYFT) are very well known.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111620-Best-RAY-MTD.png))**

&gt; In the large-cap S&amp;P 500, the gains haven't been as gaudy but are still impressive. As shown in the table below, the twenty top-performing stocks in the index are all up over 30% MTD. One sector well represented on this list is Energy with eight of the twenty names listed coming from that sector.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111620-Best-SP-MTD1.png))**

&gt; While just about every stock in the S&amp;P 500 is up this month, 18 stocks have managed to trade lower. Of these 18 stocks, only two - Hanesbrands (HBI) and NortonLifeLock (NLOK) - are down more than 5%. What's really interesting about this list, however, is that while Energy dominates the list of S&amp;P 500 winners, no sector dominates the list of losers as it's a diverse set of stocks spanning ten of the eleven GICS sectors. The only sector not represented is Industrials.

&gt; # Long Term Averages Taken Out

&gt; With equities having another strong day yesterday, a large number of stocks closed above their 200-DMAs. For the S&amp;P 500 as a whole, nearly 90% of the index closed above their long term moving averages. That was the highest percentage for the broad index since July 3rd, 2014. As equities pullback today, that reading is lower at 86.56% as of this writing which is still in the 90th percentile of readings since 1990.

&gt; As shown in the charts below, the same applies on a sector by sector basis as well. Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Financials, Industrials, and Materials all currently boast readings above 90%. For Consumer Discretionary, there have been a few similarly high readings since the start of the month, and these have all been the highest on record since at least 1990. For other sectors, recent readings have similarly been at multi-year highs. Levels for Communication Services, Health Care, and Materials, are all their highest since September or late August, but for others, it has been much longer since we saw similar readings. For example, the last time Industrials saw as high of a percentage of stocks above their 200-DMA was way back in May of 2013, and for Consumer Staples, the last higher reading was in October of 2013. The sector that has the weakest number of stocks above their 200-DMAs is unsurprisingly Energy. Whereas yesterday exactly half of the stocks in the Energy sector finished above their 200-DMA, today less than a third remain above that level. Granted, that is far better than the end of October when not even 5% were above.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111720-200-Day.png))**

&gt; In the table below, we show a list of the S&amp;P 500 Energy sector's components showing how far each is above/below their 200-day moving average as well as the MTD and YTD performance. Baker Hughes (BKR), Halliburton (HAL), and Marathon (MPC) are all the most elevated, currently above their 200-DMAs by double-digit percentages. TechnipFMC (FTI) and National Oilwell Varco (NOV) have been the top performers in the sector, but they both still sit a few percentage points below their 50-DMAs even after rallies of more than 40% this month. The only Energy sector stock to have fallen in what has been a remarkably strong month is Cabot Oil and Gas (COG), though it is one of the best performers YTD with a decline of just 2.4%. Still, its recent decline leaves it as one of the furthest below its 200-DMA.

&gt; # Stocks Flying Around the Globe

&gt; Since bottoming on the last trading day of November, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) has had a banner month so far this November rising 10.61% month to date. While there is still nearly two weeks left in the month, SPY is on pace for its best month since April. That is also in the top 1% of monthly moves of the past two decades. Other than April, the only month of the past 20 years that has seen a larger gain was October of 2011.

&gt; Looking across the various country ETFs in our Global Macro Dashboard, there similarly have been some massive moves so far this month. Several of these have risen over 20% and only two, India (INDA) and China (MSHI), have risen by single-digit percentages. Spain (EWP), Italy (EWI), France (EWQ), Mexico (EWW), Norway (ENOR), and the UK (EWU) are all on pace for their best month of the past twenty years. Every other country ETF is also seeing monthly moves in the top decile of their respective 20-year ranges. For some of these, like Singapore (EWS) or Switzerland (EWL), this month has been the best month in over a decade.

101,DELL,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning November 23rd, 2020","Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 23rd, 2020.

# **Stocks may continue to struggle Thanksgiving week amid Covid-19 outbreaks  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/20/stocks-may-continue-to-struggle-thanksgiving-week-amid-covid-19-outbreaks.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks could continue to struggle with the twin themes of the spreading virus and a potentially robust recovery, once a vaccine is deployed next year.
*****
&gt; In the coming week, the restrictions the spreading virus is imposing on the economy will be clear, when many Americans choose to stay at home over the Thanksgiving Day holiday and partake in much smaller celebrations.
*****
&gt; “On the Covid side, there will be more lockdowns, but I think the message is loud and clear. ‘People: Don’t be cavalier around Thanksgiving,’” said Tom Lee, founder of Fundstrat. Thanksgiving traditionally kicks off the holiday shopping season, an important time of the year for the economy which could be hobbled by Covid. The U.S. reported 182,000 new cases Thursday.
*****
&gt; Lee said the market will continue to feel the push pull of the drag from the pandemic against the promise of recovery, seen in the rebound of cyclical stocks. Cyclical sectors industrials and materials were both up about 1% for the week, and financials were up a half percent. But tech and communications, both big tech and growth sectors that benefited from the stay-at-home trade, were lower.
*****
&gt; “I think stocks are kind of consolidating and maybe it’s going to go on for a couple of days,” Lee said. He added that stocks could start to perk up late in the week, and investors are expecting stocks to head higher into year end. “The cyclicals have held up like champs, and the small caps, and value have been really holding up,” Lee said.
*****
&gt; Stocks were mixed in the past week, with the Dow and S&amp;P 500 slightly lower, and the Nasdaq up 0.2%. The Russell 2000 was the star performer, with a gain of 2.4% for the week. The Russell is up 16% since the beginning of October.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P shot up sharply on Nov. 9 when Pfizer announced its vaccine as 95% effective, but it never regained that intraday high of 3,645 and has since traded in a sideways pattern. The S&amp;P 500 closed at 3,557 Friday, down 0.8% for the week.
*****
&gt; JPMorgan economists warned Friday that the “winter will be grim” and they forecast that the restrictions due to the virus will drag on the economy, resulting in a negative first quarter. They expect a strong rebound in the second and third quarter, once the vaccine is distributed and an anticipated fiscal stimulus program takes hold.
*****
&gt; “It’s hard for some investors to look over that period and see the recovery. I think this is where we are now,” said Katie Nixon, Northern Trust Wealth Management CIO. She said the concern is how much damage the restrictions will do as the virus spreads at a record rate. “This is happening and with exponential force right now. It’s just shocking to see the numbers and how state and local authorities are trying to deal with it in a variety of ways.”
*****
&gt; But Nixon said she’s very positive on the market longer term, and the economy will heal once the vaccine becomes available. She said fiscal stimulus from Washington would help.
*****
&gt; Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell signaled he would again discuss a package with Democrats, and that funds that were being used for Fed programs could be diverted to a fiscal package.
*****
&gt; The Treasury Thursday indicated it would not continue five of the Fed’s emergency program from when they expire at year end, surprising some in the markets. The Fed objected, but the markets took the development in stride, as traders expect the programs to be reinstated if financial conditions warrant it.
*****
&gt; The Fed releases the minutes of its last meeting Wednesday afternoon, and that could be important as traders are watching to see if the central bank reveals any detail of discussions on potential changes to its asset buying program. There is widespread speculation the Fed could tweak its $80 billion Treasury buying program at the December meeting to include more longer duration notes and bonds, a move that should hold down already low long-term rates.
*****
&gt; Also in the week ahead, there is some key data including personal income and spending and durable goods on Wednesday. Consumer confidence is Tuesday and consumer sentiment is released Wednesday. There are also a few Fed speakers, who will be watched closely for any comments on the expiring programs.
*****
&gt; Any word on fiscal stimulus talks will get market attention, though there is skepticism anything will before next year. If a package is not passed, the unemployment benefits going to 12 million Americans will end at the end of December, and mortgage forbearance will end. Bank of America economists said if there is no stimulus package to prevent these things, there would be a 1.5 percentage point drag on first quarter growth.
*****
&gt; “The biggest thing we need to do is prevent bankruptcies and prevent unemployment from rising,” Nixon said. She said the labor market has stalled, and it is important to avoid the deep scarring from bankruptcies.
*****
&gt; She said it is not too late for investors to get in on the rotation into growth,and some investors are worried they didn’t get in on time. “Value has so much to go to catch up on growth,” she said.

&gt; # The Thanksgiving Trade

&gt; Trading around Thanksgiving has a bullish tendency perhaps buoyed by the “holiday spirit.” First published in the 1987 Stock Trader’s Almanac, the Wednesday before and the Friday after Thanksgiving combined were up 34 times in 35 years. The only S&amp;P 500 decline was in 1964.

&gt; Subsequently, this trend changed. In the 33 years since 1987, there have been 9 declines and 24 advances. The best short-term trade appears to be getting long into any weakness on Monday or Tuesday of Thanksgiving week and selling into any subsequent rally by the end of Thanksgiving week. But as COVID-19 cases are on the rise again remain nimble as exogenous events like Greece’s debt crisis in 2011 or 2018’s fourth quarter rout can cancel Thanksgiving on Wall Street.

&gt; Also of note is the change in the yearend rally. Prior to 1987, from the close of trading on the Friday after Thanksgiving to yearend, the S&amp;P 500 rallied only 20 times in 35 years. As Thanksgiving bullishness lost steam in 1987, the rally afterwards occurred more frequently. Since 1987, S&amp;P 500 has logged gains in 25 of 33 years from the close on Friday after Thanksgiving to yearend.

&gt; # 5 Noteworthy Charts To Watch As Stocks Soar

&gt; First, the big economic data point this week was retail sales. Although the headline number was a little light at 0.3% versus an expected 0.5% gain month-over-month, it still hit another new all-time high along the way (source: US Census Bureau). “The miss could be a sign the consumer is finally starting to slow amid record COVID-19 cases and more restrictions, with restaurant sales dipping for the first time since April,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

&gt; The good news is retail sales has hit a new high for five consecutive months, and the economy has never been in a recession after three consecutive new highs—yet another sign the recession may be over, even if it hasn’t been called officially.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.18.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; How strong has the recent rally been? Well, as of Tuesday’s close, the S&amp;P 500 Index was on pace to have its second-best month of November ever. November isn’t over yet of course, but this could open the door to a potential late-month snap back lower after a huge move, which would be perfectly normal and healthy.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.18.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; After Monday’s record close, the S&amp;P 500 now has 24 new all-time high closes in 2020.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.18.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; The surge after the election was historic in many ways. The number of stocks in the S&amp;P 500 recently making new monthly highs caught our attention. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, previous surges in new monthly highs opened the door for near-term weakness, but the weakness was a nice buying opportunity. In fact, a year after previous major breadth thrusts saw stocks higher every single time, not something we want to ignore.

&gt; Last, more than 85% of the stocks in the S&amp;P 500 recently were above their 200-day moving average—another sign of impressive participation in this recent market strength. Once again, future results would suggest this extreme strength is a sign of potential future strong performance and weakness could be used as a buying opportunity.

&gt; # B.I.G. Tips - Retail Sales Slow

&gt; The October Retail Sales report missed expectations this morning on both a headline and core basis. In addition to the weaker than expected reading for October, September's report was also revised lower.

&gt; Breadth in this month’s report was also negative for the first time since April. Of the thirteen sectors tracked in the report, just five showed growth while eight declined. On the positive side, Non-Store retail was the main bright spot with m/m growth of 3.11%. That’s the last thing every traditional retailer wants to hear and could be indicative of another wave of retrenchment on the part of consumers as the weather gets colder and case counts rise. Electronics and Appliances also reported strong sales growth likely aided by the launch of the iPhone 12. On the downside, Clothing and Sporting Goods both saw m/m declines of over 4%, while sales at General Merchandise retailers dropped 1.1%.

&gt; While the monthly pace of retail sales is back at all-time highs, the characteristics behind the total level of sales have changed markedly in the post COVID world. In our just-released B.I.G. Tips report, we looked at these changing dynamics to highlight the groups that have been the biggest winners and losers from the shifts.

&gt; # Finally A New High for Small Caps

&gt; It only took over two years, but the Russell 2000 finally put in a new all-time high on Friday. As shown in the charts below, Friday marked the first all-time high on a closing basis since August 31st, 2018; a total of 553 trading days between highs. As shown in the second chart below, since the index began trading in the late 80's, that makes for the third-longest stretch without a new high. The only two longer periods were from March 10th, 2000 through April 2nd, 2004 and from July 16, 2007 through April 26th, 2011. Both of those streaks were nearly twice as long as the past two years' streak.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111620-R2000.png))**

&gt; The Russell 2000 is up another 2% to more fresh highs this morning, but the recent move to new highs has left the index very overbought. As shown in the snapshot of our Trend Analyzer below, at Friday's close small caps like the Russell 2000 (IWM) and Core S&amp;P Small-Cap ETF (IJR) are two of the most overbought major index ETFs after having seen some of the strongest performance over the past five days. Granted, as other large-cap indices like the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) were quicker to return to all-time highs earlier this year making them some of the stronger performers on the year, small caps have been laggards on a year to date basis. In other words, this year's weakest performers have been a factor in recent strength. Click here to view Bespoke's premium membership options for our best research available.

&gt; # A Month for the Ages

&gt; Just when you think you've seen it all from this market, a month like November comes around. Stock returns so far this month have been extraordinary, and what makes the gains even more impressive is the fact that they came not from a starting point of a depressed bear-market environment but instead from a level that was already pretty close to record highs. Within the Russell 3000, which encompasses stocks with market caps of all sizes, the average MTD performance of stocks in the index is a gain of over 15%. Even in the large-cap S&amp;P 500, the average stock in the index has rallied more than 13.5% so far this month! Keep in mind too that these are just averages, and plenty of individual stocks are up multiples of that.

&gt; In the Russell 3000, there are 51 stocks that are up over 50% so far in November. We don't have enough room to list them all, but the first table below shows the twenty top performers. Topping the list is Five Prime Therapeutics (FPRX), which has rallied more than 349% this month! That's years worth of returns in sixteen days. Behind FPRX, there are two other stocks - Cooper Standard (CPS) and Revlon (REV) - which have both more than doubled. Many of the names listed below are unknown small caps, but a handful of names like Transocean (RIG), Coty (COTY), and Lyft (LYFT) are very well known.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111620-Best-RAY-MTD.png))**

&gt; In the large-cap S&amp;P 500, the gains haven't been as gaudy but are still impressive. As shown in the table below, the twenty top-performing stocks in the index are all up over 30% MTD. One sector well represented on this list is Energy with eight of the twenty names listed coming from that sector.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111620-Best-SP-MTD1.png))**

&gt; While just about every stock in the S&amp;P 500 is up this month, 18 stocks have managed to trade lower. Of these 18 stocks, only two - Hanesbrands (HBI) and NortonLifeLock (NLOK) - are down more than 5%. What's really interesting about this list, however, is that while Energy dominates the list of S&amp;P 500 winners, no sector dominates the list of losers as it's a diverse set of stocks spanning ten of the eleven GICS sectors. The only sector not represented is Industrials.

&gt; # Long Term Averages Taken Out

&gt; With equities having another strong day yesterday, a large number of stocks closed above their 200-DMAs. For the S&amp;P 500 as a whole, nearly 90% of the index closed above their long term moving averages. That was the highest percentage for the broad index since July 3rd, 2014. As equities pullback today, that reading is lower at 86.56% as of this writing which is still in the 90th percentile of readings since 1990.

&gt; As shown in the charts below, the same applies on a sector by sector basis as well. Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Financials, Industrials, and Materials all currently boast readings above 90%. For Consumer Discretionary, there have been a few similarly high readings since the start of the month, and these have all been the highest on record since at least 1990. For other sectors, recent readings have similarly been at multi-year highs. Levels for Communication Services, Health Care, and Materials, are all their highest since September or late August, but for others, it has been much longer since we saw similar readings. For example, the last time Industrials saw as high of a percentage of stocks above their 200-DMA was way back in May of 2013, and for Consumer Staples, the last higher reading was in October of 2013. The sector that has the weakest number of stocks above their 200-DMAs is unsurprisingly Energy. Whereas yesterday exactly half of the stocks in the Energy sector finished above their 200-DMA, today less than a third remain above that level. Granted, that is far better than the end of October when not even 5% were above.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111720-200-Day.png))**

&gt; In the table below, we show a list of the S&amp;P 500 Energy sector's components showing how far each is above/below their 200-day moving average as well as the MTD and YTD performance. Baker Hughes (BKR), Halliburton (HAL), and Marathon (MPC) are all the most elevated, currently above their 200-DMAs by double-digit percentages. TechnipFMC (FTI) and National Oilwell Varco (NOV) have been the top performers in the sector, but they both still sit a few percentage points below their 50-DMAs even after rallies of more than 40% this month. The only Energy sector stock to have fallen in what has been a remarkably strong month is Cabot Oil and Gas (COG), though it is one of the best performers YTD with a decline of just 2.4%. Still, its recent decline leaves it as one of the furthest below its 200-DMA.

&gt; # Stocks Flying Around the Globe

&gt; Since bottoming on the last trading day of November, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) has had a banner month so far this November rising 10.61% month to date. While there is still nearly two weeks left in the month, SPY is on pace for its best month since April. That is also in the top 1% of monthly moves of the past two decades. Other than April, the only month of the past 20 years that has seen a larger gain was October of 2011.

&gt; Looking across the various country ETFs in our Global Macro Dashboard, there similarly have been some massive moves so far this month. Several of these have risen over 20% and only two, India (INDA) and China (MSHI), have risen by single-digit percentages. Spain (EWP), Italy (EWI), France (EWQ), Mexico (EWW), Norway (ENOR), and the UK (EWU) are all on pace for their best month of the past twenty years. Every other country ETF is also seeing monthly moves in the top decile of their respective 20-year ranges. For some of these, like Singapore (EWS) or Switzerland (EWL), this month has been the best month in over a decade.

206,DELL,MU,"MU is a major memory chip manufacturer. Their two in-house brands are Lexar (everyday user) and Crucial (enthusiast PC), but they also manufacture RAM and other off-label products for companies like Dell and HP. 

I decided to try the crazy long-shot of 65c 12/18 on MU because I thought their increased production in time for the holidays should start pricing in towards the end of November. The calls were purchased mid-October. Thanks to the elections and the COVID crash, their stock price feel to $50, but today, it rallied up to $54 and is still going up as we speak.

124,DELL,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thurs, Oct 15, 2020. Please enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, October 15, 2020**

Stocks fell once again today for the third straight day of losses, as market participants consider a disappointing unemployment report, new virus-related restrictions in Europe, and dimming prospects for additional stimulus before the november election

The Nasdaq finished 0.67% down. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) fell a modest 0.11% and the Dow finished the day 0.04% down. Stocks were able to mostly recover from the deeply red open. 

The Labor Department released their weekly unemployment, which showed that an additional 898,000 new claims were submitted last week, way above the consensus estimate of 830,000.  This is the highest number since Aug. 22 and another clear sign that the labor market continues to struggle to recover in this pandemic-riddled economy as cases rise and worries increase over a renewed wave in the fall and winter. The number represented a gain of 53,000 from the previous week’s. The economy has recaptured some 11.4 million positions, or about half those who were sidelined. The unemployment rate has come down to 7.9% but is still more than double its pre-pandemic level.

After Europe seemed to somewhat tame the virus that ravaged the countryside early in the year, the number of newly confirmed infections are skyrocketing, prompting fears of a second-wave and host of new restrictions. Socialising indoors will be banned in London, and a curfew will be imposed in nine French cities. Poland designated red zones where schools and gyms will close, including in the capital Warsaw, and the Czech Republic said it was building its first field hospital for coronavirus patients. Schools in Italy's southern Campania region, including the city of Naples, are to close for two weeks, as the country recorded its highest daily rise of cases since mass testing began. Coronavirus is the fifth-leading cause of death in Europe, where a threshold of 1,000 deaths daily has been passed, the WHO's European director, Dr Hans Kluge, told a news conference today. In the United States, new cases per day are on the rise in 44 states, with the biggest surges in the Midwest and Great Plains, where resistance to wearing masks and observing other social distancing practices has been running high. Deaths per day are climbing in 30 states, according to data collected from John Hopkins University.

Market participants continue to be fixated on whether more stimulus, which lawmakers and economists say is necessary, will be passed before the November election. Messaging from top officials regarding stimulus has been inconsistent, with Pres. Trump first said he was directing his representatives to halt negotiations before doing a 180 degree turn. Yesterday, Mnuchin conceded that “getting something done before the election and executing on that would be difficult, just given where we are in the level of details”. Today, in response to being asked if he supported stimulus, Pres. Trump told Fox Business, “I would. Absolutely I would. I would say more. I would go higher. Go big or go home, I said it yesterday.” Needless to say the inconsistent messaging heightened volatility in the market as investors have a heightened sense of risk. Additional relief is viewed by many (including Jerome Powell) as a necessary propellant to maintain and speed up economic recovery. 

**Highlights**

* US regulators (FDA) approved yesterday afternoon the first treatment for Ebola Virus from Regeneron (REGN). This is the same company that made the treatment that President Trump received while being treated for COVID-19 about two weeks ago.

209,DELL,"AMD and the 150B question, an in-depth look of AMD VS Intel (part 2)","Positions: Shares in AMD because I am a pussy

**Introduction:**

This is a follow up to my original post that I made a few months ago as I promised, you can find it here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hbwcpv/amd\_analysis\_and\_why\_you\_should\_sell\_big\_blue/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hbwcpv/amd_analysis_and_why_you_should_sell_big_blue/)The following post will assume that you already read my previous post  or have an understanding of how the semiconductors work. This will cover two primary subjects, number one, Intel VS AMD and their competitive advantages, including nodes, partnerships and foundries along with how I expect things to play out over the next few years.

**Intel VS AMD**

*The following documents Intel’s most recent launch and the potential inconsistencies I found, please be aware that the reviewers are not at fault and should not be blamed for anything that is potentially foul play.*

***Cascade Lake and a story of deception***

[Intel 10900k](https://preview.redd.it/7yez283s1eo51.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b3f1084db75351722976e4809b6f0eeb52decd8)

The x86 CPU space has two companies currently competing in it. One is the master and one is subservient, but what happens when these roles get reversed and the master becomes the underdog?

The fight gets dirty.

Ever since the launch of the Zen architecture, AMD has been slowly gnawing away at Intel’s market share, Zen 1 brought them back into the discussion, Zen+ consolidated their position and Zen 2 brought the fight to Intel’s crown jewels. Intel in the years since Zen launched floundered with 10nm, and now 7nm while TSMC slowly ran away with their lead in manufacturing all the while AMD continued to innovate. This left Intel with two choices, buckle down and try to work the problem, or fight dirty. They chose the latter.

In 2018, well before Zen 2 launched, AdoredTV investigated Intel and their relation with reviewers and found that Intel was most likely seeding the tech press with golden samples. The scale of this was astonishing, almost all sites that he investigated had received exceptional samples.

This was in 2018, when Intel was still firmly in the lead when compared to AMD’s Zen+ architecture. What about now? When AMD is on par or firmly in the lead with Zen 2?

Inspired by Adored’s Conlake video, I chose to look into any potential foul play with their newest 10900k launch.

***Methodology***

In order to ensure that Intel was fairly portrayed, I looked into as many publications that I could who published their all core overclocks along with their voltages set in the bios. All in all I found 17 publications that fulfilled the criteria.

After I had collected the necessary data, I reached out to Silicon Lottery to ask about higher bins than what they published, that being 5.2 GHz, and 5.3 GHz.

They kindly responded to me and provided this information:

*“I can tell you that 1) we do not publish statistics until we reach a sample size of at least 100,*

*and 2) there are a few 10900K that can fall within our theoretical 5.2GHz bin (we're talking about top \~1% here), but a 5.3GHz bin is not possible for a 10900K under our tests.”*

From this statement we can safely assume that their theoretical 5.2 GHz bin would use 1.4 volts as each 100 MHz bump is matched by an increase of 0.025 volts, with their highest binned parts reaching 5.1 GHz at 1.375 volts.

With that out of the way let’s move onto my findings.

***Findings***

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/a38vi7jl1eo51.png?width=577&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3dd2481044072d630ec6607e12300a9c903668f0

*\*Power draw from the wall was about equivalent to that of Guru3D, implying a voltage of 1.4 volts.*

*\*\*JayzTwoCents did not mention the voltage used, but I felt it was important to mention him as his result was completely out of line when compared to other sites.*

The first important note that should be made is that for some of the sites, they started with a voltage of 1.35 and applied a multiplier without doing any further tuning, meaning some of these publications could have achieved a better overclocking result. Secondly, because of the nature of some reviews, I could not get as many sources as I originally intended, but 17 should suffice for our needs.

With that out of the way, we can look at a few numbers, the average clock speed achieved and the average voltage necestated.

**Average all core overclock:**

*5.164 GHz*

**Average Voltage:**

*1.341 Volts*

And we can also determine the mean all core overclock and voltage, which will be important to ensure the results are not skewed by aberrant values such as with JayzTwoCents and Overclock 3D.

**Mean all core overclock**

*5.1 GHz*

**Mean Voltage:**

*1.332 Volts*

As we can see, both the average and the mean samples would be considered Golden samples by Silicon lottery, who have had less than 100 samples achieve similar results. It is clear that something is a little fishy here, so let’s take a deeper look into the results.

Starting with Guru3D, the first result that completely blew me away, 5.2 all core overclock with only 1.35 volts applied. When compared to Silicon Lottery of less than 1% of samples reaching 5.2 GHz under their testing with the assumed 1.4 volts. Even if we are generous and add an extra 0.025 volts to ensure long term stability, Guru3D’s review sample far exceeds the theoretical requirements for a 5.2 GHz, golden sample bin.

Moving onto the next stand out, Overclocker 3D, we see an absolutely astonishing result, 5.4 GHz with a voltage of 1.402. Silicon Lottery stated that they do not believe it is possible for a 10900k to reach 5.3 GHz all core, let alone 5.4 GHz. This sample is definitively a golden sample, in all likelihood, Silicon Lottery has never seen a part that can perform this well despite testing hundreds of chips.

All other chips are excellent samples as well, with the vast majority of them landing in golden sample territory or at worse, good samples.

That being said, there is one outlier, JayzTwoCents. I am not entirely sure what happened here, it is the only chip that did not make 5.0 GHz, and is the only chip that would not be considered a good bin. Perhaps some wires got crossed or he was sent a retail unit by accident.

***Conclusion***

Make of this what you will, but I feel that this is a clear demonstration that Intel is again seeding press with golden samples. This could have been done by them to quell the rumours that the 10900k would be a power hog or to potentially dull the edge of any potential reviews, but it is pretty clear that something is amiss.

It is also clear that Intel will continue to pull shenanigans until we call them out for it. I feel that the press should be a little more discerning or more skeptical of their results given what I have found and what Adored found in the past.

Finally if you plan to buy an Intel product, please be aware that misleading information such as this is present and be aware of it.

**The future of Intel?**

As we can see, Intel is not shy about potentially deceiving press and consumers. That being said, I do not expect to see any legal consequences come of this as it is very difficult to ascertain if this did indeed happen.

That being said, the pain has just begun for Intel. The following will encompass a brief overview of some Intel products and the major issues they will be facing in the near future.

***The death of a leading foundry***

In my last post, I said that Intel would not be highly competitive in 2022. While I admit, I was hoping to get the follow up post out much sooner, what I meant by this is Intel will not have 7nm until 2022 at the earliest. That being said, with Intel’s most recent quarterly earnings, I have to readjust my personal road map for Intel, and I now believe they will be competitive again at earliest, 2023. There are a few reasons for this, and the following will be based upon leaks from Moore’s Law is Dead, AdoredTV and RedGamingTech. All three have proven to be reliable sources, with Moore’s Law is Dead predicting almost the exact performance of Intel Tiger Lake months in advance.

Currently, as we all are aware of, Intel is encountering massive difficulties with their 10nm and 7nm production. The issues are so prevalent that 10nm has been delayed for years, and 7nm will be delayed for just as long if not longer. Because of this they have been forced to delay product launches, back port architectures and increase power consumption massively to keep pace with AMD.

That being said, they cannot continue to increase power consumption in all sectors, for example, in note books, AMD recently launched their much anticipated Renoir APUs, which far exceed both press and my expectations. At the moment AMD’s solutions are notably stronger in multithreaded tasks and graphics work loads when compared to Intel Cascade Lake and Intel Ice Lake. In fact, according to Hardware Unboxed, a reputable review channel, it is not uncommon to see AMD perform at twice the level as Intel when comparing low power solutions (15 watt TDP or lower). That being said, Intel Tiger Lake is a good improvement in terms of GPU performance, outclassing AMD by \~20% in the 15 W form factor, while still being significantly weaker in multithreaded performance.

This shows that Intel absolutely needs 10nm yesterday, they cannot continue to increase power and lose efficiency, sooner or later they will find that even though their products consume twice the power, they are out classed in all aspects. That wall will be Zen 3.

[AMD 3950x](https://preview.redd.it/b5t3ptno1eo51.jpg?width=1344&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a4e828f32c5a5efe809ab6625f5e27d4f5003cf)

***Zen 3***

This will be brief as not much has changed from my previous post, and I still fully expect AMD to take the gaming crown from Intel Cascade Lake. However, there are a few small updates that I must make. Intel Rocket Lake is expected to come out Q1 or Q2 of 2021, and it will have 8 cores at most. Though I am not sure why Intel would want to max their consumer platform at only 8 cores, and not maintain 10 cores, I suspect that 10 cores may consume too much power. However, it will have a 10-20% IPC bump, which *might* allow it to reclaim the gaming crown from Zen 3, though at the moment it could be a toss up depending on how well Zen 3 scales with frequency.

Furthermore, I will clarify a few things:

1. Zen 3 will have a unified cache, meaning that latency should be lower as packets do not have to cross over the infinity fabric.
2. Zen 3’s cores will have more access to L3 cache as it is unified, meaning it will have to access system memory less, thereby again improving latency.
3. Zen 3 should have a small clock speed increase from an improved node, though I suspect it will be no more than 200 MHz
4. Finally, Zen 3 should also have a higher f-clock, meaning it will have lower latency when accessing the system memory.

All in all, Zen 3 is a relatively iterative performance increase over Zen 2, with a 15-20% increase in single threaded performance being likely.

***Big and Little cores Vs Zen 4***

A few months ago, Moore’s Law is Dead detailed Alder Lake and Sapphire Rapides; Intel’s “big” comeback. The following will be a summary of what he detailed, and I strongly recommend you watch his video to understand my reasoning to what will happen: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqErX7VkitI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqErX7VkitI)

The gist of it:

1. Alder Lake will be on 10nm, and will utilize “big cores” with high ipc, and “little cores” with low ipc, and low power consumption.
2. Alder Lake will come out late 2021 or early 2022.
3. Sapphire Rapides will be Intel’s big splash back into the data center, and will succeed Ice Lake server.
4. Sapphire rapides will most likely have 56 cores.

My opinion:

Though we have very little information on Zen 4, we know one thing for certain, it will be on 5nm TSMC. You may immediately see the issue, in my last post I said that 5nm was designed to compete with Intel 7nm, not 10nm. AMD will still have a node advantage. This along with what we know so far, Zen 4, will increase core counts substantially again, and it will be an advanced package solution, this shows that unless Alder Lake and Sapphire Rapids come out two quarters or more before Zen 4, it will not be competitive.

This is a major issue for Intel because as I detailed previously Intel’s roadmap is massively behind schedule and I believe that all products that have yet to be announced, such as Alder Lake and Sapphire rapids will have been delayed by at least a few months. These delays will be further compounded by Intel’s wording security problems forcing companies to either purchase more Intel products as a stop gap, or migrate over to AMD.

***Data Center and the Cloud***

If you work in the server space, you know that security is paramount, and as I said in my last post, Intel has none of it. Now you may ask, why is Intel still selling massive amounts of CPUs to various OEMs such as Dell? Here is the reason as detailed by Mike Burzonne (who is supporting the Federal Trade Commission v Intel Corp. Dockets 9288 and 9341) on SeekingAlpha:

“Average OEM price where I suspect deeper discounts are available for large volume bundles and hyperscale / cloud commercial.

Desktop $283.79

Mobile $282.13

Xeon $715.04”

Now the astute may see the issue, Intel is selling these for much less than their suggested retail value. Essentially what these large OEMs are doing is, buy Xeons on the cheap, burning through them in about a year, then purchasing new ones. Obviously this is not sustainable, so they are potentially looking at AMD.

Mike Burzonne also believes that AMD ships about 50m units per year compared to the 400m of Intel, and from this the issue is clear, they do not have enough capacity to bring on these large OEMs in any meaningful way, plus the software stack is not entirely mature yet.

Now if you look at the software stack, this is a very real head wind, but things are slowly changing, when Zen 3 is released, the Zen architecture will be just about 4 years old, which is typically when you start to see software maturity at around 5 years. This compounded with improved efficiency over Zen 2 should allow AMD to make a very convincing argument to not buy Xeons. Furthermore, we also know that AMD is ramping wafer orders from TSMC thus they should be able to increase shipments and bring large OEMs on board.

The way that Intel is going to combat this is by selling Xeons on the cheap while showing off what they have coming down the pipeline to incentivise companies to make do with their current products. The issue with this is they have proven time and time again that they do not have the ability to execute, as proven most recently by the 7nm delays.

***Trouble with the FTC***

This will be very brief as I do not entirely understand the ins out outs of the suit, but the reason I specifically brought up Mike Burzonne was his involvement in an anticompetitive suit against Intel for monopolistic practices as summarized in my first post. Mike Burzonne believes that total damages could exceed 20b and a 2010 revision states 88B in damages.

The reason why the charges are so slow to move is Mike Burzonne believes that the FTC and the European Union are synchronizing to ensure that the charges are proper and cannot be easily dismissed, nor will there be lasting economic tensions as Intel is a US based cooperation.

If you wish to read more about the suit, here is the 2010 revision: [https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/public\_comments/proposed-consent-agreement-matter-intel-corporation-corporation-ftc-docket-no.9341-550006-00014%C2%A0/550006-00014-55228.pdf](https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/public_comments/proposed-consent-agreement-matter-intel-corporation-corporation-ftc-docket-no.9341-550006-00014%C2%A0/550006-00014-55228.pdf)

**Conclusion/TLDR**

As I believe I highlighted very clearly, Intel is increasingly starting to turn to more shady tactics to paint themselves in the best light possible, such as with the Cascade Lake reviews, they are losing ground to AMD in efficiency and performance, they are losing server market share and they have a potential massive lawsuit on the horizon.

All of this should demonstrate that AMD has a golden opportunity to gain massive market share as Intel toils with 10nm and 7nm.

One final thing I should note, is that the FTC lawsuit is very much uncertain, and I would be wary of basing any decisions on it.

Finally, I see AMD as worth 150B in the next few years as they eat Intel’s lunch, cloud compute continues to grow rapidly, and their collaborations with Xbox and PS5 bear fruit.",161,73,1600642674.0,2020-09-20T22:57:54+00:00,t3_iwobaj,wallstreetbets

**Summary**

Once again today was a day full of records, the major indexes had an incredible run hitting all sort of highs the S&amp;P500 closed up 1% and the NASDAQ up a whopping 1.7% . The Dow Jones lagged behind a little, but still closed 0.3% up, its at its highest point since the March lows. Market pushed by a combination of optimism on China trade talks, vaccine hopes, and liquidity. Interesting to note the Russel 2000 closed down 0.7% today.

The big one today is that Hurricane Laura is expected to be devastating when it hits the Gulf of Mexico area and potentially could cause up to $25Billion in damages, according to Bloomberg. Currently its a category 4 out of 5 maximum in the Saffir-Simpson Scale jumping from a category 1 in a day. This will cause even further stress on an already ailing oil industry.

Presidential campaigns continue to develop during these unprecedented times. While at the same time stimulus talks seem to have  hit a bump in the road. FED Chairman Jerome Powell is set to speak tomorrow on the FED’s monetary policiy framework with emphasis on inflation management. They have already declared that interest rates will remain at zero for the foreseeable future.

Meanwhile the market seems to be on its own agenda as talks rage on between the experts as to whether we are in bubble territory, whether the market is overvalued, or if the economy is already on its way to a sustainable massive recovery to all time highs.

# **Markets look to the Fed again to build on S&amp;P 500 record as Congress continues to disappoint  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/21/markets-look-to-the-fed-again-to-build-on-sp-500-record-as-congress-continues-to-disappoint.html)**
*****
&gt; Market pros hold out little hope that Congress will agree to a stimulus package before September, but they will look to Jerome Powell in the coming week to provide a roadmap for what else the Fed might do to help the economy.
*****
&gt; The Fed holds its annual Jackson Hole symposium starting Thursday, and it will conduct the Kansas City Fed-sponsored meeting virtually rather than against the backdrop of the Grand Tetons as it normally does at this time of year. The Fed chairman speaks Thursday morning on the implications for monetary policy and the Fed’s anticipated policy framework review.
*****
&gt; The past week was a big week for markets, with the S&amp;P 500 finally recovering its losses from the pandemic selloff and setting new all-time highs. Stocks have been big beneficiaries of the Fed’s easy policies and low interest rates, and Fed officials are widely expected to sound dovish when they meet in the coming week.
*****
&gt; “I think we know the Fed’s all in. If anything they want the mechanicals to work right,” said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. “The basic Fed policy is crystal clear. You’re going to have low rates for the foreseeable future. They will do whatever it takes.”
*****
&gt; But Fed watchers expect Powell to go further than the Fed’s already extraordinary support for the economy and financial conditions, and offer guidance on new language and policies that will help the markets understand how long it might hold those low rates and extraordinary policies in place.
*****
&gt; For instance, the Fed was expected to provide a more explicit forward guidance policy, and it could also introduce inflation averaging, meaning the Fed could specify that it could both undershoot and overshoot its 2% inflation target. Inflation has only occasionally surpassed its target over the past dozen years, since the financial crisis.
*****
&gt; Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays, said he expects the Fed will introduce forward guidance and average inflation targeting at its September meeting. He expects the Fed’s policy review to examine all of its policies to determine which work best in different circumstances.
*****
&gt; Since the markets collapsed in February and March, the Fed has cut rates to zero and helped increase liquidity with different facilities for different areas of the capital markets like commercial paper, municipal bonds and corporate bonds. It also created lending programs and continues to buy a large amount of Treasury securities and mortgages. Its balance sheet has now ballooned to $7 trillion.
*****
&gt; With average inflation targeting, the Fed would allow the economy and inflation to run hotter than target, without immediately taking steps to tighten policy, according to Jim Caron, fixed income portfolio manger with Morgan Stanley Investment Management.
*****
&gt; “What they’re saying is if the economy starts to recover, let’s say we get a vaccine, or the rate of infection goes down, and the equity market is on a tear, they’re not going to stop it,” said Caron. “They’re going to stay there for awhile. That’s what they’re trying to communicate.”
*****
&gt; # Where’s the stimulus?
&gt; As markets await clarity from the Fed, market pros are expecting less from Congress after first initially anticipating a stimulus package by early August.
*****
&gt; “At this point, the thing I’m most thinking about is are we going to get a stimulus deal or not,” said Keon. “I think the politics are shifting beneath that.” He said some Republicans in Congress may be less inclined to spend on a big package ahead of the election.
*****
&gt; Democrats and Republicans have been far apart in terms of the contents of the package. One hot button issue is the $600 supplemental weekly aid for the unemployed. It expired on July 31, and Republicans want to cut it to $200 a week while Democrats want to keep current levels. The White House meanwhile has moved to provide $300 a week in aid from FEMA funds but the states have to process those payments.
*****
&gt; The two parties are also still far apart on the size of the package, after initially starting out with Democrats at $3 trillion and Republicans with $1 trillion.
*****
&gt; “Some folks are discovering their inner budget hawks. It looks like the positions of the two sides are moving further away rather than closer together,” said Keon. “As the election moves up on us, the possibilities of a deal are going down...the markets are slowly moving toward the idea we don’t get stimulus deal and we might get a Biden presidency. It’s not panicking about it.”
*****
&gt; The Democratic party held its convention this past week, formally nominating former vice president Joseph Biden to head the Democratic ticket. The Republican convention begins Monday. Biden leads President Donald Trump by an average 7.4 percentage points in the major polls, according to RealClearPolitics.com.
*****
&gt; Michael Schumacher, director rate strategy at Wells Fargo, said he too is becoming more skeptical a stimulus deal will get done. “As the election season gets going, it appears to be getting harder and harder, not from a timing standpoint but from a lack of goodwill standpoint,” he said.
*****
&gt; Strategists said if the economic data weakens, that could hurt stocks and get Congress back to negotiating a new package. There had been expectations a package would include a one-time payment for individuals and families, enhanced unemployment payments and aid for state and local governments.
*****
&gt; Raymond James Washington policy analyst Ed Mills said the two sides are likely to come together, but without a catalyst forcing them it may wait until they need to pass a continuing resolution on the budget Sept. 30. “Democrats are not going to allow for an appropriations bill to pass that does not include additional support for the economy,” said Mills.
*****
&gt; # It’s the economy
&gt; There is some key data in the week ahead that should show how manufacturing and the consumer are faring.
*****
&gt; Durable good is reported Wednesday, while personal income and spending data is reported Friday. Consumer confidence is Tuesday and consumer sentiment is released Friday.
*****
&gt; Energy markets will be keeping a close eye on two tropical storms that are heading into the Gulf of Mexico and could make landfall early Wednesday. One storm, Laura is tracking close to Florida, and a second storm, possibly to be named Marco looks to be heading across the Yucatan Peninsula before entering the Gulf.
*****
&gt; It would be unprecedented in the era of satellites and modern hurricane tracking technology for two storms to arrive within 24 hours. The Weather Channel reports there was such an occurrence in September, 1933.

&gt; # September Almanac: Only Modest Improvement in Election Years

&gt; Start of business year, end of summer vacations, and back to school made September a leading barometer month in first 60 years of 20th century, now portfolio managers back after Labor Day tend to clean house Since 1950, September is the worst performing month of the year for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 1000 (since 1979). Sizable gains in September 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2017 have lifted Russell 2000 to second worst (since 1979). September was creamed four years straight from 1999-2002 after four solid years from 1995-1998 during the dot.com bubble buildup.

&gt; Bullish election-year forces do little to improve on September’s poor overall performance over the same time frame. September’s performance does improve slightly in election years, but it is still negative nearly across the board. Only the Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 have been able to escape negative territory and post modest 0.2% and 0.8% average gains respectively in the last ten election year Septembers.

&gt; # 5 Charts To See With Stocks At New Highs

&gt; “Better late than never.”

&gt; It took a while, but the S&amp;P 500 Index finally made a new all-time high, coming all the way back from the vicious 34% bear market in less than six months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pic-8.19.20-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; It might bring back some scary memories, but back in March it took the S&amp;P 500 only 16 days to go from new highs to a bear market (down 20%), the fastest ever.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “This will go down as the fastest bear market ever, but also one of the fastest recoveries ever,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Then again, we’ve never quite seen a recession and recovery like this, so maybe it isn’t a shock to see new highs this quickly.”

&gt; The bear officially lasted one month and took five months to recover the losses. Usually when there’s a bear market during a recession, it takes 30 months to recover those loses. This was the third-fastest ever, with only 3 months to recover from a bear market recession in the early ‘80s and 4 months to recover from a bear market in the early ‘90s.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-3.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; It seems like earlier this year and new highs were a lifetime ago, but the S&amp;P 500 finally moved off unlucky 13, notching the 14th new high of 2020.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-4.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, returns after a long time without new highs actually get better. One, three, six, and 12 months after the first new high in more than five months show stronger performance than average or after any new highs. Yet another reason to think that this bull market from a long-term point of view could have some more tricks up its sleeve.

&gt; Last, we found there were four other times the S&amp;P 500 made a new high during a recession: In February ’61, July ’80, November ’82, and March ’91. Incredibly, a new expansion started the following month every single time. Could stocks at new highs be signaling an end to this recession? We think that very well could be the case again this time.

&gt; # Largest S&amp;P 500 Stocks + Tesla (TSLA)

&gt; Tesla (TSLA) is now up 50% over the last 10 calendar days dating back to August 11th. This has propelled the company way up the list of the largest US companies.

&gt; Below is a table of the largest stocks in the S&amp;P 500 with Tesla (TSLA) included. As shown, Tesla's $382.7 billion market cap would rank it as the 9th largest stock in the S&amp;P 500 were it in the index.

&gt; On August 11th, Tesla's market cap was just $256 billion, so over the last ten days it has leapfrogged companies like Walmart (WMT), Home Depot (HD), JP Morgan (JPM), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Mastercard (MA), and NVIDIA (NVDA). Next up would be Visa (V) and Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), which have market caps just under $400 billion. Click here to view Bespoke's premium membership options for our best research available.

&gt; # B.I.G. Tips - Earnings Season and Top Triple Plays

&gt; Walmart (WMT) wrapped up the Q2 2020 earnings reporting period on Tuesday with a huge beat on both the top and bottom line. It was a fitting end to what turned out to be a record-setting earnings season.

&gt; As we highlighted in our Q2 Earnings Season preview in early July, analysts were rapidly increasing earnings estimates leading up to earnings season. Normally when that happens, stocks have trouble performing well during earnings season because the expectations bar has been set higher. This season, even with analyst estimates on the rise in the four weeks leading up to the start of the reporting period, companies managed to beat bottom-line EPS estimates at the highest rate in the history of our database going back to 1999.

&gt; As shown below, 76% of companies reported stronger-than-expected EPS numbers this season, which eclipsed the prior record high of 73% seen during the Q3 2006 reporting period.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/beatratesbyquarter.png))**

&gt; Long-term Bespoke subscribers know how much we like earnings triple plays, but for those that haven’t heard of the term, we came up with it back in the mid-2000s. An earnings triple play is a company that beats EPS estimates, beats revenue estimates, and raises forward guidance all in the same quarterly earnings report. Investopedia.com is one of the best online resources for financial markets education, and they’ve actually given us credit for coining the “triple play” term on their website. We consider triple play stocks to be the cream of the crop of earnings season, and we are constantly finding new long-term buy opportunities from this basket of names each quarter.

&gt; This earnings season there were a massive number of earnings triple plays. We went through the list of this season's triple plays to find the ones that have the most attractive set-ups heading into the earnings off-season.

# **Markets look to the Fed again to build on S&amp;P 500 record as Congress continues to disappoint  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/21/markets-look-to-the-fed-again-to-build-on-sp-500-record-as-congress-continues-to-disappoint.html)**
*****
&gt; Market pros hold out little hope that Congress will agree to a stimulus package before September, but they will look to Jerome Powell in the coming week to provide a roadmap for what else the Fed might do to help the economy.
*****
&gt; The Fed holds its annual Jackson Hole symposium starting Thursday, and it will conduct the Kansas City Fed-sponsored meeting virtually rather than against the backdrop of the Grand Tetons as it normally does at this time of year. The Fed chairman speaks Thursday morning on the implications for monetary policy and the Fed’s anticipated policy framework review.
*****
&gt; The past week was a big week for markets, with the S&amp;P 500 finally recovering its losses from the pandemic selloff and setting new all-time highs. Stocks have been big beneficiaries of the Fed’s easy policies and low interest rates, and Fed officials are widely expected to sound dovish when they meet in the coming week.
*****
&gt; “I think we know the Fed’s all in. If anything they want the mechanicals to work right,” said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. “The basic Fed policy is crystal clear. You’re going to have low rates for the foreseeable future. They will do whatever it takes.”
*****
&gt; But Fed watchers expect Powell to go further than the Fed’s already extraordinary support for the economy and financial conditions, and offer guidance on new language and policies that will help the markets understand how long it might hold those low rates and extraordinary policies in place.
*****
&gt; For instance, the Fed was expected to provide a more explicit forward guidance policy, and it could also introduce inflation averaging, meaning the Fed could specify that it could both undershoot and overshoot its 2% inflation target. Inflation has only occasionally surpassed its target over the past dozen years, since the financial crisis.
*****
&gt; Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays, said he expects the Fed will introduce forward guidance and average inflation targeting at its September meeting. He expects the Fed’s policy review to examine all of its policies to determine which work best in different circumstances.
*****
&gt; Since the markets collapsed in February and March, the Fed has cut rates to zero and helped increase liquidity with different facilities for different areas of the capital markets like commercial paper, municipal bonds and corporate bonds. It also created lending programs and continues to buy a large amount of Treasury securities and mortgages. Its balance sheet has now ballooned to $7 trillion.
*****
&gt; With average inflation targeting, the Fed would allow the economy and inflation to run hotter than target, without immediately taking steps to tighten policy, according to Jim Caron, fixed income portfolio manger with Morgan Stanley Investment Management.
*****
&gt; “What they’re saying is if the economy starts to recover, let’s say we get a vaccine, or the rate of infection goes down, and the equity market is on a tear, they’re not going to stop it,” said Caron. “They’re going to stay there for awhile. That’s what they’re trying to communicate.”
*****
&gt; # Where’s the stimulus?
&gt; As markets await clarity from the Fed, market pros are expecting less from Congress after first initially anticipating a stimulus package by early August.
*****
&gt; “At this point, the thing I’m most thinking about is are we going to get a stimulus deal or not,” said Keon. “I think the politics are shifting beneath that.” He said some Republicans in Congress may be less inclined to spend on a big package ahead of the election.
*****
&gt; Democrats and Republicans have been far apart in terms of the contents of the package. One hot button issue is the $600 supplemental weekly aid for the unemployed. It expired on July 31, and Republicans want to cut it to $200 a week while Democrats want to keep current levels. The White House meanwhile has moved to provide $300 a week in aid from FEMA funds but the states have to process those payments.
*****
&gt; The two parties are also still far apart on the size of the package, after initially starting out with Democrats at $3 trillion and Republicans with $1 trillion.
*****
&gt; “Some folks are discovering their inner budget hawks. It looks like the positions of the two sides are moving further away rather than closer together,” said Keon. “As the election moves up on us, the possibilities of a deal are going down...the markets are slowly moving toward the idea we don’t get stimulus deal and we might get a Biden presidency. It’s not panicking about it.”
*****
&gt; The Democratic party held its convention this past week, formally nominating former vice president Joseph Biden to head the Democratic ticket. The Republican convention begins Monday. Biden leads President Donald Trump by an average 7.4 percentage points in the major polls, according to RealClearPolitics.com.
*****
&gt; Michael Schumacher, director rate strategy at Wells Fargo, said he too is becoming more skeptical a stimulus deal will get done. “As the election season gets going, it appears to be getting harder and harder, not from a timing standpoint but from a lack of goodwill standpoint,” he said.
*****
&gt; Strategists said if the economic data weakens, that could hurt stocks and get Congress back to negotiating a new package. There had been expectations a package would include a one-time payment for individuals and families, enhanced unemployment payments and aid for state and local governments.
*****
&gt; Raymond James Washington policy analyst Ed Mills said the two sides are likely to come together, but without a catalyst forcing them it may wait until they need to pass a continuing resolution on the budget Sept. 30. “Democrats are not going to allow for an appropriations bill to pass that does not include additional support for the economy,” said Mills.
*****
&gt; # It’s the economy
&gt; There is some key data in the week ahead that should show how manufacturing and the consumer are faring.
*****
&gt; Durable good is reported Wednesday, while personal income and spending data is reported Friday. Consumer confidence is Tuesday and consumer sentiment is released Friday.
*****
&gt; Energy markets will be keeping a close eye on two tropical storms that are heading into the Gulf of Mexico and could make landfall early Wednesday. One storm, Laura is tracking close to Florida, and a second storm, possibly to be named Marco looks to be heading across the Yucatan Peninsula before entering the Gulf.
*****
&gt; It would be unprecedented in the era of satellites and modern hurricane tracking technology for two storms to arrive within 24 hours. The Weather Channel reports there was such an occurrence in September, 1933.

&gt; # September Almanac: Only Modest Improvement in Election Years

&gt; Start of business year, end of summer vacations, and back to school made September a leading barometer month in first 60 years of 20th century, now portfolio managers back after Labor Day tend to clean house Since 1950, September is the worst performing month of the year for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 1000 (since 1979). Sizable gains in September 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2017 have lifted Russell 2000 to second worst (since 1979). September was creamed four years straight from 1999-2002 after four solid years from 1995-1998 during the dot.com bubble buildup.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/e4e433c87c6e4c76cefda4ccffbf5ab0/cfdd6d36ba180c35-7f/s400x600/836cc65ffaba5c46d56ea4566614d200638be344.jpg))**

&gt; Bullish election-year forces do little to improve on September’s poor overall performance over the same time frame. September’s performance does improve slightly in election years, but it is still negative nearly across the board. Only the Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 have been able to escape negative territory and post modest 0.2% and 0.8% average gains respectively in the last ten election year Septembers.

&gt; # 5 Charts To See With Stocks At New Highs

&gt; “Better late than never.”

&gt; It took a while, but the S&amp;P 500 Index finally made a new all-time high, coming all the way back from the vicious 34% bear market in less than six months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pic-8.19.20-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; It might bring back some scary memories, but back in March it took the S&amp;P 500 only 16 days to go from new highs to a bear market (down 20%), the fastest ever.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “This will go down as the fastest bear market ever, but also one of the fastest recoveries ever,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Then again, we’ve never quite seen a recession and recovery like this, so maybe it isn’t a shock to see new highs this quickly.”

&gt; The bear officially lasted one month and took five months to recover the losses. Usually when there’s a bear market during a recession, it takes 30 months to recover those loses. This was the third-fastest ever, with only 3 months to recover from a bear market recession in the early ‘80s and 4 months to recover from a bear market in the early ‘90s.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-3.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; It seems like earlier this year and new highs were a lifetime ago, but the S&amp;P 500 finally moved off unlucky 13, notching the 14th new high of 2020.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-4.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, returns after a long time without new highs actually get better. One, three, six, and 12 months after the first new high in more than five months show stronger performance than average or after any new highs. Yet another reason to think that this bull market from a long-term point of view could have some more tricks up its sleeve.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-5.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Last, we found there were four other times the S&amp;P 500 made a new high during a recession: In February ’61, July ’80, November ’82, and March ’91. Incredibly, a new expansion started the following month every single time. Could stocks at new highs be signaling an end to this recession? We think that very well could be the case again this time.

&gt; # Largest S&amp;P 500 Stocks + Tesla (TSLA)

&gt; Tesla (TSLA) is now up 50% over the last 10 calendar days dating back to August 11th. This has propelled the company way up the list of the largest US companies.

&gt; Below is a table of the largest stocks in the S&amp;P 500 with Tesla (TSLA) included. As shown, Tesla's $382.7 billion market cap would rank it as the 9th largest stock in the S&amp;P 500 were it in the index.

&gt; On August 11th, Tesla's market cap was just $256 billion, so over the last ten days it has leapfrogged companies like Walmart (WMT), Home Depot (HD), JP Morgan (JPM), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Mastercard (MA), and NVIDIA (NVDA). Next up would be Visa (V) and Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), which have market caps just under $400 billion. Click here to view Bespoke's premium membership options for our best research available.

&gt; # B.I.G. Tips - Earnings Season and Top Triple Plays

&gt; Walmart (WMT) wrapped up the Q2 2020 earnings reporting period on Tuesday with a huge beat on both the top and bottom line. It was a fitting end to what turned out to be a record-setting earnings season.

&gt; As we highlighted in our Q2 Earnings Season preview in early July, analysts were rapidly increasing earnings estimates leading up to earnings season. Normally when that happens, stocks have trouble performing well during earnings season because the expectations bar has been set higher. This season, even with analyst estimates on the rise in the four weeks leading up to the start of the reporting period, companies managed to beat bottom-line EPS estimates at the highest rate in the history of our database going back to 1999.

&gt; As shown below, 76% of companies reported stronger-than-expected EPS numbers this season, which eclipsed the prior record high of 73% seen during the Q3 2006 reporting period.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/beatratesbyquarter.png))**

&gt; Long-term Bespoke subscribers know how much we like earnings triple plays, but for those that haven’t heard of the term, we came up with it back in the mid-2000s. An earnings triple play is a company that beats EPS estimates, beats revenue estimates, and raises forward guidance all in the same quarterly earnings report. Investopedia.com is one of the best online resources for financial markets education, and they’ve actually given us credit for coining the “triple play” term on their website. We consider triple play stocks to be the cream of the crop of earnings season, and we are constantly finding new long-term buy opportunities from this basket of names each quarter.

&gt; This earnings season there were a massive number of earnings triple plays. We went through the list of this season's triple plays to find the ones that have the most attractive set-ups heading into the earnings off-season.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks.",6,1,1598096824.0,2020-08-22T11:47:04+00:00,t3_ieh2na,stocks
106,DELL,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning August 24th, 2020","Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 24th, 2020.

# **Markets look to the Fed again to build on S&amp;P 500 record as Congress continues to disappoint  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/21/markets-look-to-the-fed-again-to-build-on-sp-500-record-as-congress-continues-to-disappoint.html)**
*****
&gt; Market pros hold out little hope that Congress will agree to a stimulus package before September, but they will look to Jerome Powell in the coming week to provide a roadmap for what else the Fed might do to help the economy.
*****
&gt; The Fed holds its annual Jackson Hole symposium starting Thursday, and it will conduct the Kansas City Fed-sponsored meeting virtually rather than against the backdrop of the Grand Tetons as it normally does at this time of year. The Fed chairman speaks Thursday morning on the implications for monetary policy and the Fed’s anticipated policy framework review.
*****
&gt; The past week was a big week for markets, with the S&amp;P 500 finally recovering its losses from the pandemic selloff and setting new all-time highs. Stocks have been big beneficiaries of the Fed’s easy policies and low interest rates, and Fed officials are widely expected to sound dovish when they meet in the coming week.
*****
&gt; “I think we know the Fed’s all in. If anything they want the mechanicals to work right,” said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. “The basic Fed policy is crystal clear. You’re going to have low rates for the foreseeable future. They will do whatever it takes.”
*****
&gt; But Fed watchers expect Powell to go further than the Fed’s already extraordinary support for the economy and financial conditions, and offer guidance on new language and policies that will help the markets understand how long it might hold those low rates and extraordinary policies in place.
*****
&gt; For instance, the Fed was expected to provide a more explicit forward guidance policy, and it could also introduce inflation averaging, meaning the Fed could specify that it could both undershoot and overshoot its 2% inflation target. Inflation has only occasionally surpassed its target over the past dozen years, since the financial crisis.
*****
&gt; Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays, said he expects the Fed will introduce forward guidance and average inflation targeting at its September meeting. He expects the Fed’s policy review to examine all of its policies to determine which work best in different circumstances.
*****
&gt; Since the markets collapsed in February and March, the Fed has cut rates to zero and helped increase liquidity with different facilities for different areas of the capital markets like commercial paper, municipal bonds and corporate bonds. It also created lending programs and continues to buy a large amount of Treasury securities and mortgages. Its balance sheet has now ballooned to $7 trillion.
*****
&gt; With average inflation targeting, the Fed would allow the economy and inflation to run hotter than target, without immediately taking steps to tighten policy, according to Jim Caron, fixed income portfolio manger with Morgan Stanley Investment Management.
*****
&gt; “What they’re saying is if the economy starts to recover, let’s say we get a vaccine, or the rate of infection goes down, and the equity market is on a tear, they’re not going to stop it,” said Caron. “They’re going to stay there for awhile. That’s what they’re trying to communicate.”
*****
&gt; # Where’s the stimulus?
&gt; As markets await clarity from the Fed, market pros are expecting less from Congress after first initially anticipating a stimulus package by early August.
*****
&gt; “At this point, the thing I’m most thinking about is are we going to get a stimulus deal or not,” said Keon. “I think the politics are shifting beneath that.” He said some Republicans in Congress may be less inclined to spend on a big package ahead of the election.
*****
&gt; Democrats and Republicans have been far apart in terms of the contents of the package. One hot button issue is the $600 supplemental weekly aid for the unemployed. It expired on July 31, and Republicans want to cut it to $200 a week while Democrats want to keep current levels. The White House meanwhile has moved to provide $300 a week in aid from FEMA funds but the states have to process those payments.
*****
&gt; The two parties are also still far apart on the size of the package, after initially starting out with Democrats at $3 trillion and Republicans with $1 trillion.
*****
&gt; “Some folks are discovering their inner budget hawks. It looks like the positions of the two sides are moving further away rather than closer together,” said Keon. “As the election moves up on us, the possibilities of a deal are going down...the markets are slowly moving toward the idea we don’t get stimulus deal and we might get a Biden presidency. It’s not panicking about it.”
*****
&gt; The Democratic party held its convention this past week, formally nominating former vice president Joseph Biden to head the Democratic ticket. The Republican convention begins Monday. Biden leads President Donald Trump by an average 7.4 percentage points in the major polls, according to RealClearPolitics.com.
*****
&gt; Michael Schumacher, director rate strategy at Wells Fargo, said he too is becoming more skeptical a stimulus deal will get done. “As the election season gets going, it appears to be getting harder and harder, not from a timing standpoint but from a lack of goodwill standpoint,” he said.
*****
&gt; Strategists said if the economic data weakens, that could hurt stocks and get Congress back to negotiating a new package. There had been expectations a package would include a one-time payment for individuals and families, enhanced unemployment payments and aid for state and local governments.
*****
&gt; Raymond James Washington policy analyst Ed Mills said the two sides are likely to come together, but without a catalyst forcing them it may wait until they need to pass a continuing resolution on the budget Sept. 30. “Democrats are not going to allow for an appropriations bill to pass that does not include additional support for the economy,” said Mills.
*****
&gt; # It’s the economy
&gt; There is some key data in the week ahead that should show how manufacturing and the consumer are faring.
*****
&gt; Durable good is reported Wednesday, while personal income and spending data is reported Friday. Consumer confidence is Tuesday and consumer sentiment is released Friday.
*****
&gt; Energy markets will be keeping a close eye on two tropical storms that are heading into the Gulf of Mexico and could make landfall early Wednesday. One storm, Laura is tracking close to Florida, and a second storm, possibly to be named Marco looks to be heading across the Yucatan Peninsula before entering the Gulf.
*****
&gt; It would be unprecedented in the era of satellites and modern hurricane tracking technology for two storms to arrive within 24 hours. The Weather Channel reports there was such an occurrence in September, 1933.

&gt; # September Almanac: Only Modest Improvement in Election Years

&gt; Start of business year, end of summer vacations, and back to school made September a leading barometer month in first 60 years of 20th century, now portfolio managers back after Labor Day tend to clean house Since 1950, September is the worst performing month of the year for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 1000 (since 1979). Sizable gains in September 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2017 have lifted Russell 2000 to second worst (since 1979). September was creamed four years straight from 1999-2002 after four solid years from 1995-1998 during the dot.com bubble buildup.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/e4e433c87c6e4c76cefda4ccffbf5ab0/cfdd6d36ba180c35-7f/s400x600/836cc65ffaba5c46d56ea4566614d200638be344.jpg))**

&gt; Bullish election-year forces do little to improve on September’s poor overall performance over the same time frame. September’s performance does improve slightly in election years, but it is still negative nearly across the board. Only the Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 have been able to escape negative territory and post modest 0.2% and 0.8% average gains respectively in the last ten election year Septembers.

&gt; # 5 Charts To See With Stocks At New Highs

&gt; “Better late than never.”

&gt; It took a while, but the S&amp;P 500 Index finally made a new all-time high, coming all the way back from the vicious 34% bear market in less than six months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pic-8.19.20-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; It might bring back some scary memories, but back in March it took the S&amp;P 500 only 16 days to go from new highs to a bear market (down 20%), the fastest ever.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “This will go down as the fastest bear market ever, but also one of the fastest recoveries ever,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Then again, we’ve never quite seen a recession and recovery like this, so maybe it isn’t a shock to see new highs this quickly.”

&gt; The bear officially lasted one month and took five months to recover the losses. Usually when there’s a bear market during a recession, it takes 30 months to recover those loses. This was the third-fastest ever, with only 3 months to recover from a bear market recession in the early ‘80s and 4 months to recover from a bear market in the early ‘90s.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-3.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; It seems like earlier this year and new highs were a lifetime ago, but the S&amp;P 500 finally moved off unlucky 13, notching the 14th new high of 2020.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-4.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, returns after a long time without new highs actually get better. One, three, six, and 12 months after the first new high in more than five months show stronger performance than average or after any new highs. Yet another reason to think that this bull market from a long-term point of view could have some more tricks up its sleeve.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-5.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Last, we found there were four other times the S&amp;P 500 made a new high during a recession: In February ’61, July ’80, November ’82, and March ’91. Incredibly, a new expansion started the following month every single time. Could stocks at new highs be signaling an end to this recession? We think that very well could be the case again this time.

&gt; # Largest S&amp;P 500 Stocks + Tesla (TSLA)

&gt; Tesla (TSLA) is now up 50% over the last 10 calendar days dating back to August 11th. This has propelled the company way up the list of the largest US companies.

&gt; Below is a table of the largest stocks in the S&amp;P 500 with Tesla (TSLA) included. As shown, Tesla's $382.7 billion market cap would rank it as the 9th largest stock in the S&amp;P 500 were it in the index.

&gt; On August 11th, Tesla's market cap was just $256 billion, so over the last ten days it has leapfrogged companies like Walmart (WMT), Home Depot (HD), JP Morgan (JPM), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Mastercard (MA), and NVIDIA (NVDA). Next up would be Visa (V) and Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), which have market caps just under $400 billion. Click here to view Bespoke's premium membership options for our best research available.

&gt; # B.I.G. Tips - Earnings Season and Top Triple Plays

&gt; Walmart (WMT) wrapped up the Q2 2020 earnings reporting period on Tuesday with a huge beat on both the top and bottom line. It was a fitting end to what turned out to be a record-setting earnings season.

&gt; As we highlighted in our Q2 Earnings Season preview in early July, analysts were rapidly increasing earnings estimates leading up to earnings season. Normally when that happens, stocks have trouble performing well during earnings season because the expectations bar has been set higher. This season, even with analyst estimates on the rise in the four weeks leading up to the start of the reporting period, companies managed to beat bottom-line EPS estimates at the highest rate in the history of our database going back to 1999.

&gt; As shown below, 76% of companies reported stronger-than-expected EPS numbers this season, which eclipsed the prior record high of 73% seen during the Q3 2006 reporting period.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/beatratesbyquarter.png))**

&gt; Long-term Bespoke subscribers know how much we like earnings triple plays, but for those that haven’t heard of the term, we came up with it back in the mid-2000s. An earnings triple play is a company that beats EPS estimates, beats revenue estimates, and raises forward guidance all in the same quarterly earnings report. Investopedia.com is one of the best online resources for financial markets education, and they’ve actually given us credit for coining the “triple play” term on their website. We consider triple play stocks to be the cream of the crop of earnings season, and we are constantly finding new long-term buy opportunities from this basket of names each quarter.

&gt; This earnings season there were a massive number of earnings triple plays. We went through the list of this season's triple plays to find the ones that have the most attractive set-ups heading into the earnings off-season.

210,DELL,Dell DD,"I work in the design field. You see Autodesk shooting up before earnings right? Premiums are big right now for ADSK, daily ATR is $7.25 so that’s probably why. 

But Dell is comparatively dirt cheap. 

Boomers aren’t running this Autodesk software on Macs. Boomer engineering &amp; design companies buy Dell workstations. Now they’re working from home on Dell laptops. Why? No idea.

This is basically speculation but fuck it.",15,9,1598033637.0,2020-08-21T18:13:57+00:00,t3_ie21kb,wallstreetbets
211,DELL,DELL earnings next week + VMWare valuation,"Haven't seen anyone talk about this yet assuming everyone is busy with pumping $ into TSLA/AAPL - but Dell earning is happening next week on Aug 27th.

PC / Monitor sales are going to off the chart especially with all the WFH / remote school buying up all these hardware. Dell also owns stake in VMware and worth $50 billion, or about $67 for every Dell share. This means that Dell is way undervalued.

Seems like there is definitely a solid play here as they've been trading flatline most of this week.

I said that a margin of safety is a discount to a thoroughly assessed true value of a company. In this case, it is not important what the assessed value is precisely, because we are buying Dell’s core business for “less than zero,” or near a 100% margin of safety. “Heads I win the jackpot, tails I don’t lose much.”

33,DELL,VMware - why is the PE ratio lower than competitors?,"VMware is a cloud infrastructure and SaaS company that has been growing every product line double digits for the past few years. Their stock has been flying under the radar for a long time, mostly due to the technical nature of their products and services. Since most of their products are the backbone to a lot of the cloud services businesses &amp; consumers use and given the recent push towards cloud and digital transformation because of coronavirus, they have stated in earnings call that they expect increased demand and continuous growth. At the very least, their stock should follow the same trajectory of other cloud service providers such as Microsoft.

Currently, the stock price has been pretty stagnant but the P/E ratio is around 9, which is oddly low for a company that competes with AWS and Microsoft, in addition to providing more niche services. The P/B ratio is insanely good as well, with nearly $30B in assets, they are essentially a classic value stock. With recent announcements of partnerships and spin-offs with Dell, as well as rumors of acquisitions from Microsoft, this company is on a path to become the next Salesforce or at least a major acquisition.

&amp;#x200B;

I was wondering if this has come across anyone else's radar and if anyone knows why the PE ratio is this low?

214,DELL,Multiple Display setup,"Hello,

I have been day trading for a few months now, I recently upgraded my setup to include 2 external monitors to my laptop. I have hooked up both screens via HDMI cables to my adaptor (pic #1), its a thunderbolt goes into usb-c port on my laptop (Dell xps-13).

I Would like somehow to save my trader workstation windows so every morning when I fire up my laptop, they are automatically restored to where I left them last.  Can anyone tell me how to save my multiple display settings? I am using windows 10, the display setup seems to be a pain in the ass, sometimes I take out the adaptor USB-c plug and when I plug it back in it totally re-numbers and jumbles all the screens. This is driving me insane! I'm not sure if this is more a windows issue, or an IB TWS issue, perhaps somewhere in the IB settings, I can save my external monitor setup. Perhaps there is some sort of dummy plug I can buy, to save my setup while I take my laptop to use in other rooms elsewhere, or when I shut down my laptop.

The issue I'm having is that when I unplug the HDMI adaptor, every morning when I plug it back in all my tws windows end up on my laptop screen only . and I have to drag them all back to where I like them. This is getting tedious and annoying to me, and I know there has to be a better way!I'm like half savvy with computers but this one is stumping me, also pissing me off!

Has anyone experienced similar issues, any advice would be much appreciated?

215,DELL,"$PSTG: PURE STORAGE for them, PURE TENDIES for you","This is actually my first DD I've ever posted so fuck you and forgive me if this doesn't work out for you.I've been looking at $PSTG for a while now and if my buying power didn't get so fucked from my decision to buy 8/7 UBER puts, I would have been already all over this play.

What had got me looking into Pure Storage was an unusual options activity alert. I've looked into this company before but didn't entirely understand what they do. Now after looking at them again, I'm still not exactly sure wtf they do....BUT I've gotten a better clue. Basically what I got from my research is that these guys fuck with ""all-FLASH data storage solutions (enabling cloud solutions and other low-latency applications where tape/disk storage does not meet the needs).""......and ultimately what this all means to me is that these are the motherfuckers making those stupid fast laser money printers with the rocket ships attached. And that's something I'm interested in.

Now, here is the D^(aily)D^(ick) you all degenerates have all been fiending for:

*Fundamentally*: [PureStorage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Storage) remains one of the few hardware companies in tech that is consistently growing double motherfucking digits, yet remains constantly cucked and neglected by investors (trading at 1.9x EV/Sales).

[https://preview.redd.it/ek7ugjsewnf51.png?width=1118&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f9c7e72c95e450a105e44223937422d896eeeb21](https://preview.redd.it/ek7ugjsewnf51.png?width=1118&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f9c7e72c95e450a105e44223937422d896eeeb21)

The 36 Months beta value for PSTG stock is at 1.62. 74% Buy Rating on RH. PSTG has a short float of 7.28% and public float of 243.36M with average trading volume of 3.16M shares. This was trading at around $18 on Wednesday 8/5 when I started writing this and as of right now, it's about $17.33 💸

The company has a market capitalization of \~$4.6 billion. In the last quarter, PSTG reported a ballin'-ass profit of $256.82 million. Pure Storage also saw revenues increase to $367.12 million. IMO, they should rename themselves PURE PROFIT. As of 04-2020, they got the cash monies flowing at $11.32 million . The company’s EBITDA came in at -$62.81 million which compares very fucking well among its dinosaur ass peers like HPE, Dell, IBM and NetApp. Pure Storage keeps taking market share from them old farts while growing the chad-like revenue #s of 33% in F2019, 21% in F2020, and 12% in F1Q21.

At the end of last quarter, Pure Storage had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $1.274B, compared with $1.299B as of Feb 2, 2020. The total Debt to Equity ratio for PSTG is recording at 0.64 and as of 8/6, Long term Debt to Equity ratio is at 0.64.Earning highlights from last quarter:

* Revenue $367.1 million, up 12% year-over-year
* **Subscription Services revenue** $120.2 million, up 37% year-over-year
* GAAP gross margin 70.0%; non-GAAP gross margin 71.9%
* GAAP operating loss $(84.9) million; non-GAAP operating loss $(5.4) million
* Operating cash flow was $35.1 million, up $28.5 million year-over-year
* Free cash flow was $11.3 million, up $29.0 million year-over-year
* Total cash and investments of $1.3 billion

I bolded the Subscription Services Revenue bullet because to me that's a big deal. Pure Storage keeps them coming back with products such as Pure-as-a-service and Cloud Block Store and everybody knows that the recurring revenue model is best model. Big ass enterprises buy storage from vendors such as Pure Storage in the cloud to prevent vendor lock-in by the cloud providers. $$$ &gt;!💰&lt;

What are Pure Storage's other revenue drivers? Well these motherfuckers also have the products to address the growth of Cloud storage as well as the products to drive the growth of on-prem storage. For on-prem data center, Pure sells Flash Array to address block storage workloads (for databases and other mission-critical workloads) and FlashBlade for unstructured or file data workloads. On-prem storage revenue is mainly driven by legacy storage array replacement cycle.

So far, it seems like Pure Storage's obviously passionate and smart as fuck [CEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHE7X5Gt71o) has been spot on with his prediction of the flash storage sector's direction. Also seems like he's not camera shy either. Pure Storage's ""Pure-as-a-Service and Cloud Block Store"" unified subscription offerings is fo sho gaining momentum it. This shit is catching on with enterprises, both big and small. COVID-19 increased the acceleration of our digital transformation and the subsequent shift to the cloud. This increased demand in data-centers is going to drastically help Pure Storage's future top and bottom line. To top it off, **NAND prices are recovering!** (inferred from MU earnings). I expect Pure Storage to get some relief on the pricing front because of this which obviously in turn should improve revenues.

PSTG's numbers look pretty good to me so far but are they a good company overall? Even when scalping and trading, I don't like to fuck with overall shitty companies so I always check for basic things like customer satisfaction, analyst ratings/targets, broad-view industry trends, and hedge fund positioning.. that sort of thing.**Pure Storage stands out in all of these fields for me.**

Customers like Dominos Pizza and many others all seem to be happy AF with no issues. I can hardly even find a negative review online. Their products seems to be universally applauded. Gartner and other third party independent analysts also consider Pure Storage's product line-up some of the best in the industry.

The industry average for this sector is a piss poor 65.Pure Storage has a 2020 Net Promoter Score of [86](https://customer.guru/net-promoter-score/pure-storage)

Enterprises are upgrading their existing storage infrastructure with newer and more modern data arrays, based on NAND flash. They do this because they're forced to keep up with the increasing speed of business inter-connectivity. This shit is the ***5g revolution*** sort to speak of the corporate business world. Storage demands and needs aren't changing because of the pandemic and isn't changing in the future. The newer storage arrays are smaller, consume less power, are less noisy and do not generate excess heat in the data center and hence do not need to be cooled like the fat fucks at IBM need to be. Flash storage arrays in general are cheaper to operate and are extremely fast, speeding up applications. Pure Storage by all accounts makes the best storage arrays in the industry and continues to grow faster than the old school storage vendors like bitchass NetApp, Dell, HPE and IBM.

Pure Storage’s market share was 12.7% in C1Q20 and was up from 10.1% in the prior year - LIKE A PROPER HIGH GROWTH COMPANY.HPE, NetApp and IBM, like the losers they are, lost market share.According to [blocksandfiles.com](https://blocksandfiles.com/2020/07/03/gartner-all-flash-array-revenues-q12020/), AFA vendor market share sizes and shifts are paraphrased below:

* “Dell EMC – 34.8% (calculated $766m) vs. 33.7% a year ago
* NetApp – 19.3% at $425m vs. 26.7% a year ago
* Pure Storage – 12.7% at calculated $279.7m vs. 10.1% a year ago
* HPE – 8.4% – $185m vs. 10% a year ago""

Pure has been gaining marketshare almost every year since it began selling storage arrays in 2011. Pure Storage is consistently rated the highest for the completeness of vision as this chart shows:

**EARNING DATE: 8/25**

Pure Storage has a history of beating estimates and rocketing up. Over the last 20 quarters, the company beat revenue 17 quarters by an average of $4.9 million or about 3%. Out of the three times that the company missed on revenues, once was due to supply fuck-ups at one of its distributors and the other two times were due to Average Selling Prices declining faster than the company forecasted. Higher-than-expected ASP declines (due to NAND oversupply) is one of the risks of the storage business...but then again NAND prices look to be recovering now if MU's earning isn't fucking with us and telling us fibs. Big money is forecasting revenue to be around $396 million, essentially flat year-over-year, and EPS of a disrespectful ass penny....Fuck that conservative ass guidance! I think PSTG is going to blow that shit out the water. This chart shows Pure Storage’s past performance and we all know for sure that past performance = future results.....right?

217,DELL,The FAA's recommendations on BA,"Alright retards, strap in. I read the FAA's 96 page summary on the 737 MAX and have the following to report. Here is the link in case you want to read for [yourself](https://www.faa.gov/news/media/attachments/737-MAX-RTS-Preliminary-Summary-v-1.pdf).

There were 7 different safety items addressed in the report. The biggest issue was the Angle of Attack (AOA) sensor and the way it allowed the pilots to interact with the plane. This sensor would basically override any actions the Pilots wanted to take and the false readings lead to the crashes years ago. The AOA sensor is manufactured by a private company called Rosemount Aerospace.

Another issue was with the ""maneuvering characteristics augmentation system"" (MCAS) which is the flight control system that is heavily impacted by all the sensors on the plane (especially the AOA).

Looking forward, the FAA has clearly stated requirements that will allow the 737 MAX to return to flight around the world. they are:

* Completion of all TAB return to service (RTS) recommendations and acceptance by the TAB of those completed actions. (these are the 7 things about AOA and MCAS)
* Completion by BA and Acceptance by FAA the new regulatory requirements
* Official revisions to documentation/training for the 737 MAX

Additionally, there are specific requirements before it can fly in the US:

* For delivered/yet to be delivered 737s, all FAA changes must be incorporated and updated based on the above changes
* All Pilots must be trained and certified on the new changes BA will be making to aircraft operation.

After this is compelte, FAA will issue a  Continued Airworthiness Notification to the International Community (CANIC) (example [here](https://www.faa.gov/news/updates/media/CAN-2019-05.pdf)). this basically tells the international 737 MAX owners to:

* strongly encouraged to mandate the pilot training identified in the 737 MAX FSB report as a minimum starting point
* be responsible for the continued airworthiness and continued operational safety (COS) of aircraft on its registry

The rest of the report breaks down in engineering terms what is wrong and how it is going to be fixed.

**TL;DR: FAA is making BA rework all of its 737 MAXs. BA will likely be taking those cost directly out of its own profit margins. Buy calls / stock on their top suppliers, who BA will have to pay for all the new equipment. BA probably fine long term but fucked short term\***

218,DELL,BJs Will Blow Away Earnings Estimates.,"This is my first DD, so sorry if formatting or anything is fucked up.

Here goes nothing,


I'm really liking BJs as a potential earnings play, depending how they run up towards their **earnings on 8/20**. Last Q they absolutely blew away earnings estimates by showing increased membership during the start of the pandemic. Last Q they were projected .37 EPS and hit it out of the ballpark with a .69 EPS(nice), and they noted that people going out and stocking up on supplies helped significantly. Q2 was the heart of the pandemic as we all know, and in the 16 states that BJs has 210+ locations, have been hit pretty hard during covid. Since they are a budget grocery store, many people are signing up to help save money and buy items in bulk.
""BJ's stock has continued to gain in July as a resurgence in coronavirus cases makes it likely that the company will see elevated demand. Grocery sales have remained high in May and June, rising about 10% from a year ago.


The pandemic also gives BJ's an opportunity to increase its membership and therefore the efficiency of its warehouses. Membership income growth was much stronger than in the first quarter a year ago, a sign that the crisis is spurring new membership. Growth in its membership base is key as it would provide a long-term benefit to the company, assuming members stay with the club.""-motley fool

""During the day the stock fluctuated 1.99% from a day low at $39.61 to a day high of $40.40. The price has risen in 9 of the last 10 days and is up by 9.1% over the past 2 weeks. Volume has increased in the last day along with the price, which is a positive technical sign, and, in total, 54 thousand more shares were traded than the day before. In total, 1 million shares were bought and sold for approximately $48.70 million.
BJ's Wholesale Club Holdings Inc. lies in the middle of a wide and strong rising trend in the short term and a further rise within the trend is signaled. Given the current short-term trend, the stock is expected to rise 46.28% during the next 3 months and, with 90% probability hold a price between $54.29 and $67.74 at the end of this period."" stock invest article


I have a strong belief that BJ continued to see membership increases during Q2 and will again beat estimates of .56 EPS. 

""BJ's stock has continued to gain in July as a resurgence in coronavirus cases makes it likely that the company will see elevated demand. Grocery sales have remained high in May and June, rising about 10% from a year ago.


""Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $2.21 per share and revenue of $14.37 billion. These totals would mark changes of +51.37% and +8.97%, respectively, from last year.""


Last Q they were projected 3.32B in revenue, and they ended up with 3.8B in revenue. They have opened up some more stores in michigan as well as additional gas stations at several of their locations. With Q2 being full on lockdown, I suspect that grocery bulk budget purchasing in q2 increased mores than Q1. 

**TLDR**: BJ destroy earnings, **BJ 40c 8/21 closed at 2.55 per contract** for the run up, IV is relatively low, going to snag some **45 9/18** and some **50c 9/18**

57,DELL,"King Bond Market Long $TLT, Bear Oil Fossil Fools and thus almost every sector ETF, selling a put of 5G companies","From the $BLK DD guy that rolled into $XLF last month.  I am currently long $SLV, $GLD, $GDX, and $GDXJ with call spreads, shares, and just pruned $AMZN and $AAPL gains but keeping $ARKF, $ARKQ, and $ARKK (ETFs with $TSLA as the largest holding.) 

Today, Friday's CNBC ""Options Action"" has just dangled calls on the $TLT, the ETF that tracks the 20+ year \*BOND PRICES move inverse to yields and the Fed would not mind rates to hit 0% to spark inflation.\*  I concur with CNBC who suggested buying August dated call spreads on $TLT.  

My $XLE long dated puts have been melting up.  I am short every sector ETF but $IBB and $XLV.  Be careful as these options are not as liquid as the $QQQ or $SPY but I cannot help that sectors are moving down when oil is down.

The VIX is holding steady, steady high.  I am not hedging with the $VIX when stay home stonks work- the $VIX is broken imao so use $GLD, $SLV, and $TLT because bond rates are going to 0% (meaning the price goes up.)

I also concur with CNBC that options are the best way to play a market by reducing risk like selling a put.  There are risky options, and very safe options if you can own 100 shares (the company could be $DTEGY Deutsche Telekom AKA T-Mobile/Sprint and the bringer of 5G eventually, pick your poison.)

I suggest selling a put for some good companies with solid balance sheets, 5G capabilities, and anything auto in the green space to get 100 shares of companies (see the next paragraph.) 

My suggestions for getting 100 shares at a cheaper price would be Ericsson (trading under $10,) Dell or VMWare (you pick the one that matches your risk,) NIO (trading below $10), $NOK at $4 is interesting,  and for big rollers Amazon (if you have the $ to own 100 shares at $2,500 or $250,000 or less, I would but that is for r/wsb)  That is, if Amazon retests $2,500.  I suggest 100 shares of $SHLL for YOLO if this bores you as this is the best $SPAC (but there is probably other ones because management is all you have with blank check companies.)  

AFTER you own 100 shares of $AAL or $TSM or Dell or whatever, you can dump the 100 shares anytime.   I suggest you keep them and sell options and join the theta gang.  Why not get paid for owning your 100 shares of $TSM \[Taiwan Semiconductor, the company onshoring manufacturing to America\] you got at $45?  $TSM August 21 $45p is $.35.  If you had 100 shares of $TSM today, selling a $60c gives you $140 just for holding the shares until August 21st.  

Bullish on onshoring green jobs because Trump leaving office is the biggest buy after the news ever.  (Buy on the rumor sell on the news but in reverse because solar employs more than fossil fools in TX pre COVIDcession.)

For examples of selling a put:  $AAL Nov 20th $2 puts are $0.14 (You are agreeing to buy 100 shares of $AAL at $2/share before or on November 20th, if you are not asked to buy $AAL you keep your $0.14 collateral and the full $14 credit.)  

A shorter dated long put $AAL Aug 21st put is $0.09 ($9.)   Or you could buy the death puts on $AAL but JPow exists, hence zombie companies, like Hertz, so that is just blowing money.  $AAL has the highest %age interest on their debt and the CLOs (their bond insurance) were the highest, I have to check again ($AAL is the worst, but not as bad as $HTZ, a worthless zombie stock.)  

\*BOND prices move inverse to yields so going from 0.5% to 0% makes the price go up\*  Zombie companies with balance sheet nightmares is what keeps bond prices upper bound at 0.8 but lower bound is 0%.

Worthless zombie stocks include banks, fossil fools, and then by default industrials, and I hate to say that I am only long $XLK and thinking of $IBB.  Every day that oil is not above $35 or in the green or both is a day stonks tank.  Every stonk will fall after earnings.  Short individual stonks going into earnings, wait- all stonks have cancelled earnings.  See why I think maximum protection by not going long the VIX but long gold, silver, even transition phase metals, copper, and BONDS.  

$NEM, $GLDI, $SLVP, $HL, $SAND, $SA, $GLTR, $PALL, $SPPP, $SSRM, $BTG , $PPLT, $PLTM, $NUGT, $BAR, $FNV all up today \[I also have $GLNCY, $SBSW, and $PLG.\]  Why own these when you can just long $GDX and $GDXJ?

I do think rates will remain positive, until they are not positive anymore, AKA Japan and Europe :).  What BOND fund would you long or short and why, besides $TLT?   If a 100 year bond comes out, the interest rate will be 0% anyways in the long run, but we are dead in the long run, so long live bonds until we decarbonize the economy, tax the rich, and pigs fly (not happening fast enough.)   Ray Dalio and many others have been harping about this, and a broken clock is right twice a day, or a bear is right when we are in a bear market with a broken VIX.

The bond market is king compared to the stonk market in sheer $.  And ForEx trades trillions a day and  is important (on days the $DXY, the basket of the dollar versus the globe) goes up $GLD should ease and is a time to buy the dip, and on days the $DXY goes down $GLD will gap up during this ""bear oil/hospitality/planes"" market.)   When the $DXY goes down, it takes more dollars to buy the gold/silver/copper/materials, and $GLD rises and is very liquid for options.  Thinking August to add to my Dec 31st $160c.  That is, unless we are going to allow millions to go into poverty, so then just buy guns and physical gold and we can trade scraps of silver.

Fossil fools, the slow pace of massive renewable energy projects, and both candidates tripping overthemselves to be more anti-China during global warming and upcoming food inflation spell the need risk reduction (if you plan on holding equities please buy puts to hedge.)

TL;DR $TLT August call spreads, $TLT is the 20 year bond ETF.  Pick companies you want to own 100 shares of by selling a put while long $GLD and long $SLV print money so holding the 100 shares prints money joining theta gang.",6,6,1593233075.0,2020-06-27T04:44:35+00:00,t3_hgnbcr,SmallStreetBets

New Highs For NASDAQ, AGAIN
 
Market Recovers From Navarro
 
Gold New Recovery High Close
 
 
Today’s market was a recovery from Mr. Navarro’s comment last night that the China trade deal was finished after Mr. Trump tweeted that it was in fact, still on track.  Choose what you wish to believe, but the farmers aren’t happy with soybeans well off their highs.  Anyway, we got passed that conflicting news and managed to trade higher with NASDAQ at another new all-time high again today.  The only issue was the fact that we closed mid-range, well off the highs.  The DJIA +131.14 (.50%), NASDAQ +74.90 (.74%), S&amp;P 500 +13.43 (.43%), the Russell +5.84 (.41%) and the Transports managed an up day, +119.59 (1.32%) for the best gain of the day. Market internals were just barely positive with NYSE 4:3 and NASDAQ 6:5, and volume expanded by 30% on the NAZ.  The DJIA was 16:14 Down with the big winners again, AAPL +53 DPs, UNH +33 and V +21, with IBM the only double-digit loser -12.
 
We added some CVS 7/67.50 calls on the decline with an average price of $1.16 and they finished $ .86, and the NEM 7/17 $60’s @ 1.55 and added to on Friday @ $1.30 for an average of $1.47 triggered a 100% Up Rule sale at $2.94 this morning.  They closed the day $2.30.  Our position in VLO 7/17 65 calls @ $2.45 closed $2.55.

SECTORS: The news that DELL would be spinning off its stake in VMWare (VMW) to shareholders, a $50billion deal sent both stocks soaring after the close.  DELL had closed $49.01 and immediately jumped to almost $60 before settling $57.90 +8.82 (18%) and VMW moved from its close of $149.23 to trade $166 and finish $162.48 +13,26 (8.9%).  Another disposal of a stake, this time Softbank’s position in T-Mobile (TMUS) looks like it will be a sizable windfall since TMUS closed at a new all-time high of $107.16 today, making it worth $32.6 billion.
In the COVID-19 vaccine arena, Inovio (INO) is getting Dept. of Defense funding to manufacture its intradermal DNA delivery device.

GOLD $1782.00 +15.60. It was a clean breakout and a continuation of the rally today, closing practically on the highs.  We bought back the 3rd and final lot of NEM @ $58.86.  And, we also added a half position in NEM 7/17 60 calls @ $1.55, and additional 50% @ $1.30 on Friday.  We sold half on the 100% Up Rule @ $2.94 yesterday and we closed $2.30 +.16 today.
 
 
BITCOIN: closed $9,660 +75. After trading back to 9,300 we rallied to new slightly higher ground.  A break over 10,000 still sends us higher. We added 350 shares of GBTC last Wednesday @ $10.02 to our position of 400 @ $8.06, bringing our average price to $8.97. GBTC closed $10.596 + .36 today.

220,DELL,AMD analysis and why you should sell big blue,"**Abstract**

Hello all, today we are going to be discussing everyone’s favorite meme stock, ~~Tesla~~ AMD! Before we get into the meat of the arguments for AMD and Intel, this is intended to be a follow up of another pretty crappy post I made a few months back, as such we will go into much further depth than before. Also I will not be providing price targets due to macro environmental circumstances.

In this post I will first have to cover some terms needed to talk about both companies’ products, and some history. Then I will talk about how both are positioned in the present and the near term (next 6 months to a year), followed by long term speculation which I’ll release later (next week maybe). Please note that I will briefly touch on NVIDIA and their products in the future speculation, but I will not go into depth due to there being a lot of misinformation circulating. I will most likely make another post doing a deep dive into the relation between NVIDIA, Intel, and AMD in late October/December.

*Also note that I do not hold any shares or derivatives in AMD, Intel or NVIDIA.*

**An introduction into the semiconductor industry**

The semiconductor industry is a massive industry currently valued at a massive 433b1, it is what powers all electronics ranging from the weakest smartwatch all the way up to the largest supercomputers. Semiconductors are made out of silicon oxide with transistors on them which perform logic functions and the likes. The semiconductor market has two large segments, that being the CPU market and the GPU market, with CPUs being used to compute a wide ranging set of data, whereas a GPU is used to perform lots of very repetitive tasks such as rendering. There are four primary companies in this space, that being Intel, AMD, NVIDIA, and ARM (note that Qualcomm and Samsung license their core architectures from ARM).

*Some important terms that are needed to understand basic things that will affect performance/competitiveness.*

1. Architecture: Refers to the design of a product think about it like how a house is built from a frame.
2. Clock speed: How many cycles a CPU/GPU can perform, each cycle is the effectuation of a certain number of calculations.
3. IPC: Instructions per clock refers to how many calculations a CPU/GPU can perform per clock cycle.
4. Core: The “processor” in a CPU/GPU that performs the calculation
5. Thread: present only in CPUs, allow multiple code paths to access a singular core at once thereby ensuring that the core is always fed with information.
6. Monolithic design: A CPU/GPU using only 1 piece of silicon.
7. MCM: Multi-chip module, a CPU/GPU that is composed of a multitude of pieces of silicon.
8. Wafer: A disc of varying size in which the transistors are inlaid on, this will later be cut up into chips
9. Chips: Smaller pieces of silicon which are typically a final product
10. Node: Refers to how small a transistor is, measured in nano-meters (NM). Note however, it is more of a marketing term and the real size of the transistors are typically much larger, furthermore different nodes are intended to compete with each other, such as Intel’s 10nm node being intended to be on parity with TSMC’s 7nm node.
11. Reticle limit: The maximum size a chip can be made on a certain node.
12. EUV: Extreme ultraviolet, is the cutting edge of semiconductor manufacturing, uses high energy ultraviolet light to imprint the transistors on the wafer, allows for increased efficiency and better yields.
13. Yields: Defect density of a wafer, if there is a defect on wafer the corresponding chip may be compromised and have to be thrown out or binned lower.
14. Binning: The practice of sorting chips by how many defects they have, a chip with a lot of defects will have lower performance then one that has none.
15. Cache: Small, low latency storage that allows for cores to quickly access data. Further divided into L1, L2, and L3 cache, with L1 cache having the lowest latency and lowest storage and L3 having the highest latency and the highest capacity.
16. Memory/RAM: Fast storage that a CPU can directly access, note that it can not store as much data as traditional solutions, but latency and transfer speed are much higher. There are currently four generations of it, that being DDR1, DDR2, DDR3, and DDR4, with DDR4 being the newest. Memory also has clock speeds which indicates indirectly how fast the data transfer is.
17. Fab/Foundry: Where wafers are made, the three largest ones are TSMC, Intel and Samsung.

**A brief history of the relation between Intel and AMD**

Intel was founded in 1968 by a few people you may know about, Gordon Moore, Robert Noyce, and Arthur Rock. Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce had left Fairchild Semiconductors with Arthur Rock providing the initial capital. Together the three made the first commercial CPU, the 4004.

[Intel 4004](https://preview.redd.it/ejutymn6lt551.jpg?width=1240&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=02c5bf57614fa67345e09a92a138189f510d718c)

&amp;#x200B;

AMD was founded a year later in 1969 and initially produced memory, but in 1981 they entered in a 10 year partnership with Intel as a secondary supplier as requested by IBM. At the time, most OEMs required a secondary supplier to ensure that they would not become too reliant on one company and to ensure that they would have enough supply should one company have issues. This meant that Intel licensed their technology to AMD so they could produce them at their own fabs.

This partnership did not last long when in 1984 Intel broke the partnership, and violated the terms which in and after numerous appeals and cases of discovery abuse on the side of Intel resulted in the court's ruling in AMD’s favor in 19902. Because of this AMD was forced to set out and create their own chips, initially copying Intel’s 80C287, which would have been shared under the 10 year partnership. This resulted in Intel suing AMD for patent infringement, however the courts ruled in AMD’s favour citing the previously mentioned case.

As the decade progressed, and the 2000s rolled around AMD came out with their own products, which handily beat Intel’s own offerings, but the damage was already done. Intel was able to make so much money that they essentially had a monopoly on the CPU market.

&amp;#x200B;

[Old benchmark demonstrating AMD's advantage over Intel](https://preview.redd.it/nj6i1pi8lt551.png?width=222&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=71c1e79f3701a998f90ec82697399c59c3705d5b)

But despite having the performance crown for about 7 years, their market share never came close to that of Intel, and the reason behind this would be revealed in 2009.

In 2009, the European commission fined Intel $USD 1.4b3. The reason behind this was Intel had bribed OEMs with cash incentives to not use AMD processors. This was to the point that Intel paid Dell 1b per year to not use AMD4. These bribes were so significant that when in 2006, in order not to be laughed out of business, they started to use AMD products, resulting in a massive 50% decrease in profit in 20065. That being said the damage was already done once again, and AMD was relegated to being a secondary competitor to Intel as they had simply run out of money. AMD released the Phenom in 2008, which was thoroughly crushed by the Intel competitors and after three years of refreshing the product with minor improvements, they released the horrible Bulldozer in 2011 which was legendary for its horrible performance, and insane power consumption. In 2016, they were near insolvency, with a share price bottoming out at 2$ per share.

All the while, Intel made small iterative performance upgrades while making all the money they could ever want. This is why your computer from 2010 is still very serviceable in 2020, 10 years later.

In 2017, AMD released their new Zen architecture with a massive 40%+ leap in IPC bringing it back into competition with Intel. Furthermore, Zen was an MCM design meaning that you could pair a few small chips to act as one large chip via Infinity Fabric, an interconnect that acted as the highways permitting multiple chips, or chiplets to communicate with each other.

**Intel VS. AMD in the modern age**

A lot has happened in the last 5 years. Currently, Intel’s technology portfolio is a complete and utter disaster, rife with stagnation. For example, Intel’s primary product, Intel’s current offerings are a mere 7% better in applications that only use 1-2 cores, than those of AMD’s while using 50% more energy and having vastly inferior in the increasingly important applications which leverage more than four cores. Intel’s highest end desktop product, the w3175x, coming in at 3k only has 28 cores, whilst the highest end AMD cpu the 3990x, has over double at 64 cores. The performance disparity is clear, AMD is the only viable option for productivity. The story continues in servers where Intel is outclassed in a similar manner to that of the desktop with performance on the AMD side being well over 200% higher. The slaughter continues into laptops where AMD’s 4900HS, completely embarrasses the highest end Intel competition while consuming ⅓ the power. The only performance crown that Intel can claim is gaming, and even then it is a mere 7% higher, due to extreme clock speeds with their newest architecture, when compared to AMD’s design, which is over a year old.

There are multiple reasons why Intel is so behind in performance, the primary being nodes. Intel’s 10 nm node was slated to launch four years ago. Four years is a very long time for any company, especially for the semiconductor space, and the sole reason why Intel was not severely punished for these stagnations was that they were miles ahead of any competitor. Earlier on I mentioned that AMD had fabs and was a secondary supplier, however as they were approaching insolvency, they sold off their fabs and partnered with Global Foundries, and later TSMC. However TSMC ramped the 7 nm, which was designed to compete with 10nm, extremely fast, handedly taking Intel’s previous position as owning the most advanced fabs. Looking at Intel’s road map, volume 10 nm will most likely hit the market by 2021, if there are no further delays, but TSMC is not sitting still, they are also innovating with the 5 nm, which was designed to compete with Intel’s 7nm hitting markets in 2020. If Intel does not get 10 nm functioning by 2021, it will spell the end of Intel’s fabs. TSMC will be not one, but two nodes ahead of Intel.

This is also compounded, though to a lesser extent by there being little to no IPC improvements in 5 years, meaning that AMD was free to catch up and in many cases surpass them.

The final nail in the coffin when it comes to Intel in the near term is their security vulnerabilities. Before 2018, all security vulnerabilities were mainly from software attacks, but that changed with the discovery of Meltdown and Specter. To show how important these issues were, let me illustrate an example. *Say you are a CEO of a major investment firm (lol), and you are using Intel servers to do whatever you need to do, you go about your day, the server is 100% secure from a software standpoint. Night comes, and you decide to look at how profitable your company was this quarter (again lol), but on the front page you see “Major leak at X company all confidential data was leaked,” you panic and call up your IT guy and he is in a panic, the head lines are correct all company data stored on any server that you own has been leaked and there is nothing you can do about it.* That is the danger of these vulnerabilities. There is absolutely nothing you or your staff could have done, and worse yet, there are over a dozen similarly dangerous vulnerabilities, and over 600 more minor ones. The only way to try and prevent these leaks are to apply patches from Intel, but this results from anywhere between a 10% to a 60% loss in performance, which needs to be made up by buying new servers as you are already at 90-100% capacity. Then you hear that a certain company, AMD, was immune to this attack and their products are vastly superior. This is the major issue plaguing Intel at the moment. For the time being you will see a major rise in server sales as people scramble to buy up servers to remain operational, but in time they will switch to AMD, with AMD forecast to take 10% in Q2 20206, up from near 0% in 2016.

**Intel VS. AMD in the near future**

At the moment AMD is uniquely positioned, their competition has yet to compete truely with their 1 year old tech, and they are on track to release brand new CPUs this year in late Q3/Q4. As a warning, we are entering grounds of speculation, but do note that this speculation is based on reliable leakers like AdoredTV7 (correctly leaked entire AMD CPU product stack from last year with only minor errors), Moore’s Law is Dead8 (correctly leaked entire CPU product stack form Intel that was released this year with near 0 errors thus far).

AMD: Intel(New product titled Zen 3, releasing this year) (New product released this year)

16 cores with 32 threads N/A

12 cores with 24 threads 10 cores with 20 threads

8 cores with 16 threads 8 cores with 16 threads

6 cores with 12 threads 6 cores with 12 threads

Things to remember

\- Zen 3 \~13-15% IPC bump7, with maybe 100ish MHz clock speed bump7, which will allow AMD to claim the final performance crown of gaming from Intel, this coupled with Intel being nowhere in sight will allow AMD to reign supreme in all faculties for a while.

**Final thoughts**

AMD is in an excellent position to capitalize on Intel’s stagnation. The security flaws could have not come at a better time, accelerating the world’s adoption of AMD CPUs and their new products will beat Intel in gaming thanks to the IPC and clock speed increase improving their gaming performance by at least 15%. Overall, Intel is a precarious spot, that being said they have vast sums of cash and they had a few key developments in the past few years which could allow them to catch up in 2022 or 2023. I will discuss that possibility in a later post along with an analysis of how AMD will perform in the GPU market with consoles on their side.

131,DELL,Investing in AMD?,"*Reposting this because I accidentally mentioned a forbidden app*

I’m very new to the stock market. I’ve been doing heaps of research the past month on how it works and how to make good investments. I know tech companies like AMD aren’t necessarily the best investments to make since things can go very wrong very fast. I also know it isn’t smart to invest based on emotion. So, I’m just asking for some advice and opinions.

I’ve been keeping up with gaming news a lot lately. Both Sony and Microsoft are using AMD processors and video cards in the next generation of consoles, which will definitely be very successful products. In addition, AMD processors are becoming the new standard in computers, and more major tech companies like Dell are starting to use AMD processors in their latest computers.

A gaming generation typically lasts 8 years-ish, and if AMD products are going to be the standard for this generation, I think things are going to start looking up for AMD.

I’m really thinking about investing in AMD as one of my first investments in addition to some ETF funds. I’m also looking for good long-term investments and I’m not too interested in day trading.

Thoughts? Criticisms? Am I just talking out of my ass? I still have a lot to learn, so anything helps!

Keep in mind I haven’t put any money into anything yet (I just opened up my back account a couple days ago). I know how risky stocks can be so I just want to make sure this is a good idea.",36,65,1592029566.0,2020-06-13T06:26:06+00:00,t3_h82432,stocks

133,DELL,Your next earning play for big gains $CPB,"So I’m the guy who’s been putting up DD for options, so far I’ve been right about my calls with $JD, $PLT, $BJ. Just with $BJ you should’ve had a 300%+ gain. $HPQ &amp; $DELL are looking good so far for this week but we will see. So with a decent record I wanted to discuss my next play. 

This will be a call for next week. Why next week and not this week? This allows for a lot of room to play the earnings run-up. it’s better to get a call before the premiums are expensive and less profitable, and it gives you time to see how the stock behaves throughout the week. 

CPB &amp; Why

Campbell Soup Company is a food company, which manufactures and markets food products. The company segments include Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, and Global Biscuits and Snacks.

Why?

The coronavirus has forced restaurants to close and reduced consumers spending power, leading many people to eat most or all of their meals at home. I understand there’s food places that do delivery and pick-ups, but unemployment keeps climbing and people are doing the most to save some $$$. 

The stock holds a P/E ratio of 17.15, while its industry has an average P/E of 19.13. Over the past year, CPB's Forward P/E has been as high as 20.32 and as low as 14.15, with a median of 18.21. Also note that CPB holds a PEG ratio of 2.40. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. CPB's industry has an average PEG of 2.60 right now. Over the last 12 months, CPB's PEG has been as high as 3.53 and as low as 2.36, with a median of 3.09.
These are just a handful of the figures considered in Campbell Soup's great value grade. Still, they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment. Add this to the strength of its earnings outlook, and we can clearly see that CPB is an impressive value stock right now.

Now let’s take a look back at their previous Earnings Calls: 

Q3 2019: Expected EPS (0.47) - Reported EPS (0.56)
Q4 2019: Expected EPS (0.41) - Reported EPS (0.42)
Q1 2020: Expected EPS (0.71) - Reported EPS (0.86)
Q2 2020: Expected EPS (0.66) - Reported EPS (0.72)
Q3 2020: Expected EPS (0.79) - Reported EPS (????)

This clearly indicates CPB has been crushing their numbers, and are actually expecting a higher EPS this Quarter than they have for the past year. To add on, companies like: WMT, BJ, COST, etc are the main distributors of Campbell’s products &amp; they all have seen a remarkable boost in sales.

TLDR get your calls before it hits 50$ and IV is still low. Don’t expect a crazy stock surge even if they beat their estimates. Don’t get too greedy with this one. Time value will be a major factor with these options expiring just a couple days after earnings. 
My current positions 6/5 $49c, 6/5 $50c.

# **Market could get a boost as states reopen, but new economic data will show just how bad things got during shutdowns  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/22/market-could-get-a-boost-as-states-reopen-but-new-economic-data-will-show-just-how-bad-things-got-during-shutdowns.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks are likely to hang on every medical development and the progress of state reopenings, but there will also be some key economic data in the coming week that should provide a glimpse into the depths of the state shutdowns.
*****
&gt; The Fed’s beige book of economic activity is released Wednesday afternoon. There is also April manufacturing data in durable goods Thursday and April’s consumer income and spending data Friday. While that should provide an interesting view of how sluggish activity became, the market is expected to focus more on May consumer confidence Tuesday and consumer sentiment Friday.
*****
&gt; “The backward looking data is not going to get any attention paid to it,” said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. “It’s going to be terrible, and that’s not going to be a surprise. Confidence has held up pretty well, all things considered. It’s the PPP and unemployment benefits. People who get some support for income seem to be pretty confident.” Congress is expected to take up changes to the Paycheck Protection Program for small business when it returns June 1.
*****
&gt; April’s economic data is expected to be about the worst of the recession, since most state shutdowns extended through a good part of the month, ahead of May reopenings. First quarter gross domestic product is expected to have declined by 4.8% when a second reading is released Wednesday, but for the second quarter, GDP is expected to decline by a median 33.1%, according to CNBC/Moody’s Analytics Rapid Update, a survey of economists.
*****
&gt; Stocks gained in the past week, though rising tensions between the U.S. and China weighed on the market Thursday and Friday and could become a bigger headwind.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was heading for a weekly gain of 3%, its second weekly gain in three. A big catalyst came Monday, when Moderna disclosed positive data from a small group of patients in an early trial, but it was a wild week of trading for the company’s stock as doubts arose about its limited results. On Friday, however, White House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said the data showed promise and he was cautiously optimistic a vaccine would be developed.
*****
&gt; Astra Zeneca’s vaccine effort got a boost this week when it received $1 billion from the U.S. Health Department’s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority to develop a coronavirus vaccine from the University of Oxford.
*****
&gt; With investors focused on vaccines and state reopenings, market winners were the more volatile Russell 2000, up 7.8% for the week and the Dow Transports, up nearly 9.1% as airlines and other reopening stocks rallied. Airlines were up nearly 20% on the week. After a batch of earnings reports, retailers were also higher on the week, with the SPDR S&amp;P Retail ETF up 6% for the week.
*****
&gt; Retailers are again among the companies reporting earnings in the week ahead, as the first quarter reporting season winds down. Costco, Nordstrom, Ulta Beauty and Burlington Stores are some of the names reporting.
*****
&gt; Keon said he is watching the economic reopenings and says the success really depends on the behavior of individuals, and whether there’s another spike in infections.
*****
&gt; “People are still scared,” he said. “It’s the personal behavior that’s going to make a difference to economic behavior. We’ll get back to some semblance of normal. It’s going to take awhile for people to feel more confident.”
*****
&gt; He expects to see a rebound of economic activity in the second half of the year, but not a V-shaped recovery.
*****
&gt; “By the end of the year, if we don’t get a vaccine, we will have made a lot of progress on a vaccine. I’m still cautiously optimistic that the market can hang in, and maybe end the year a little bit higher,” he said.
*****
&gt; One big reopening in the week ahead will be on Tuesday when the iconic NYSE trading floor reopens.

# Weekly Market Performance – May 22, 2020: Stocks Solid in the Midst of Health and Political Challenges

&gt; # Equities

&gt; US equities delivered solid returns this week. With three hours to go in the week, all three markets were up almost 3% for the week, with the best performer, once again, the technology-heavy Nasdaq. The small cap Russell 2000 Index enjoyed an impressive rally, with the index returning over 9% for the week. The mid-cap S&amp;P 400 Index also had a solid showing, returning almost 9%.

&gt; Amid ongoing COVID-19 disruptions, rising unemployment, and risks associated with reopening the economy, US stocks continued to rebound. The rally was supported by all 50 states easing restrictions, based on improving COIVD-19 trends. Several timely indicators have pointed to a pickup in economic activity, including higher credit and debit card spending and an increase in travelers based on TSA data. Second quarter gross domestic product (GDP) could contract as much as 30% annualized, but global progress in reopening economies combined with massive stimulus measures point to a potentially strong rebound in the third and fourth quarters.

&gt; “The S&amp;P 500 just had the second-best 40-day rally ever, with only the returns off the March 2009 lows better,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Near-term, we have some concerns of a well-deserved pullback, but historically, these huge moves have tended to resolve much higher over the ensuing 6- and 12-month periods.”

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.22.20-wmp.jpg?ssl=1))**

&gt; In a change of pace, industrials were the top-performing sector for the week, followed by the energy sector. The worst-performing sectors were healthcare and consumer staples, and they posted returns that were slightly negative for the week. Looking at style, large cap value stocks edged out large cap growth for the week.

# Leading Indicators Signal Potential Bottom

&gt; Leading economic indicators are signaling that the pace of economic deterioration may be slowing. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index (LEI), a composite of leading data series, fell 4.4% month over month in April. While this is an undeniably abysmal reading, it is an improvement from the -7.4% in March.

&gt; ”The monthly LEI change tends to bottom early in a recession, and sometimes even before a recession’s official start,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Stocks are forward looking, so if investors feel confident that the economic damage will not accelerate from here, they may be more willing to put capital to work. We think today’s LEI number largely confirms April’s strong moves in the equity markets.”

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Economic-news-5.22.20.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; The performance of the 10 underlying components in the LEI does indicate some disconnect between financial markets and the real economy. The two largest positive contributors to the headline LEI number this month were stock prices and the interest rate spread, which were buoyed by a swift and robust monetary and fiscal stimulus. Meanwhile, data series related to manufacturing, unemployment, and construction hurt the index, a reflection of the damage done to the parts of the economy in which workers are unable to perform their jobs remotely.

&gt; As local economies begin to reopen, we look for the industries disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 virus to begin to rebound. While this will likely be a bumpy process, progress will likely become evident in future LEI releases and confirm that the worst of the economic declines are behind us. We think this should pave the way for further equity gains over a long-term horizon.

# What Happens When The Bear Ends?

&gt; The incredible rally off the March 23 lows continues for equities, with the S&amp;P 500 Index now up more than 32% in 40 trading days. As impressive as the rally has been, we do have some near-term concerns, as we discussed in Downside Risk Remains. Higher valuations, US-/China relations, weakening technicals, and the historically troublesome summer months all could play a part in potential weakness after the record run.

&gt; “In 40 trading days, the S&amp;P 500 gained 32%, which is second only to the 40 days off the March 2009 lows,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Looking back at history shows that after the initial surge off of bear lows, stocks tend to correct about 10%, which is something we could see this time around.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 rallied nearly 21% in 30 days after all major bear markets. But once those initial rallies ended, there was a correction of more than 10% on average. Bottoms are a process, and as impressive as this run has been, we think the odds are quite high for some type of pullback or correction over the coming months. Thanks to our friends at Strategas Research Partners for the data points below.

# Bottom Line EPS Beat Rate Below Average

&gt; The first quarter earnings reporting period unofficially came to an end earlier this week, and it should be considered quite a success given how well the equity market performed during this time period. Since earnings season began on April 13th, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) has gained more than 5%. Of course, the market's performance over the last month or so has much more to do with expectations on re-opening than how companies reported in Q1, but all things considered, the sky didn't fall when it came to earnings results.

&gt; In terms of how actual earnings reports came in versus analyst expectations this past earnings season, the trend wasn't all that rosy. We've been tracking ""beat rates"" for more than a decade, which measure the percentage of companies reporting stronger than expected EPS and sales numbers (relative to consensus analyst estimates). Our main ""beat rate"" trackers show beat rates on a rolling 3-month basis -- meaning it looks at all companies that have reported earnings over the last three months and tells you what percentage of them beat analyst estimates.

&gt; Below is a snapshot of both bottom-line EPS and top-line sales beat rates over the last five years as displayed on our website at our ""Earnings Explorer"" page. Notably, bottom-line EPS beat rates have been weakening quite dramatically over the last couple of months since the COVID crisis began. Just this week, the 3-month rolling EPS beat rate dipped below its long-term average of 59.37% dating back to the year 2000.

&gt; On the other hand, top-line sales beat rates haven't taken quite the hit yet. The current sales beat rate stands at 60.67%. While sales on an absolute basis fell dramatically at the end of Q1, the fact that sales beat rates haven't fallen dramatically means companies have at least managed to keep up with analyst expectations. A very weak sales beat rate would have meant companies were reporting numbers even weaker than already dour analyst expectations.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/epsbeats.png))**

&gt; We also have a forward guidance tracker that measures the percentage of companies raising guidance versus the percentage of companies lowering guidance. When this reading turns negative, it means more companies have lowered guidance than raised guidance over the last three months. As shown below, right now our guidance spread stands at -16.08 percentage points, which is the weakest reading we've seen since early 2016.

&gt; One thing we've seen since the COVID crisis began is that more and more companies have withdrawn guidance altogether. It's hard to blame them. The ones that have issued guidance have mostly lowered expectations. While this paints a bleak picture for the future, if you look at this from a ""glass half full"" perspective, it actually leaves much more room for positive surprises down the road.

# S&amp;P 500 Down Five Straight Day After Memorial Day

&gt; Our office will be closed for observance of Memorial Day on Monday, May 25. U.S stock and bond markets will also be closed. As you spend some quality time off please consider taking time to commemorate those who have paid the ultimate price while serving in the U.S. military. Additionally, consider taking a moment to acknowledge first responders, nurses, doctors, law enforcement, firefighters, essential workers, scientists and everyone else that has tirelessly worked and sacrificed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

&gt; For decades the Stock Trader’s Almanac has been tracking and monitoring the market’s performance around holidays. The trading day after Memorial Day has a mixed record going back to 1971. Both S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have declined more often than risen on the day, but average performance is still modestly positive. Since 1986, the frequency of gains has improved, and average performance has also risen however, over the last five years S&amp;P 500 has declined. The second trading day after Memorial Day has more advances than declines, but average performance is negative for NASDAQ. The third day after appears to have the best long- and short-term record combined with solid average performance.

# Election-Year June: Candidate Clarity Boosts Performance

&gt; June has shone brighter on NASDAQ stocks over the last 49 years as a rule ranking seventh with a 0.8% average gain, up 27 of 49 years. This contributes to NASDAQ’s “Best Eight Months” which ends in June. June ranks near the bottom on the Dow Jones Industrials just above September since 1950 with an average loss of 0.2%. S&amp;P 500 performs similarly poorly, ranking tenth, but essentially flat (0.1% average gain). Small caps also tend to fare well in June. Russell 2000 has averaged 0.8% in the month since 1979.

&gt; In election years since 1950, June’s performance improves notably. June is the #5 DJIA month in election years averaging a 0.9% gain with a record of twelve advances in seventeen years. For S&amp;P 500, June is #2 with an average gain of 1.3% (14-3 record). Election-year June ranks #4 for NASDAQ and Russell 2000 with average gains of 1.6% and 1.4% respectively. This performance improvement is most likely the result of presidential candidate field being sufficiently narrowed, and the ultimate nominees being identified.

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

134,DELL,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning May 25th, 2020","Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 25th, 2020.

# **Market could get a boost as states reopen, but new economic data will show just how bad things got during shutdowns  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/22/market-could-get-a-boost-as-states-reopen-but-new-economic-data-will-show-just-how-bad-things-got-during-shutdowns.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks are likely to hang on every medical development and the progress of state reopenings, but there will also be some key economic data in the coming week that should provide a glimpse into the depths of the state shutdowns.
*****
&gt; The Fed’s beige book of economic activity is released Wednesday afternoon. There is also April manufacturing data in durable goods Thursday and April’s consumer income and spending data Friday. While that should provide an interesting view of how sluggish activity became, the market is expected to focus more on May consumer confidence Tuesday and consumer sentiment Friday.
*****
&gt; “The backward looking data is not going to get any attention paid to it,” said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. “It’s going to be terrible, and that’s not going to be a surprise. Confidence has held up pretty well, all things considered. It’s the PPP and unemployment benefits. People who get some support for income seem to be pretty confident.” Congress is expected to take up changes to the Paycheck Protection Program for small business when it returns June 1.
*****
&gt; April’s economic data is expected to be about the worst of the recession, since most state shutdowns extended through a good part of the month, ahead of May reopenings. First quarter gross domestic product is expected to have declined by 4.8% when a second reading is released Wednesday, but for the second quarter, GDP is expected to decline by a median 33.1%, according to CNBC/Moody’s Analytics Rapid Update, a survey of economists.
*****
&gt; Stocks gained in the past week, though rising tensions between the U.S. and China weighed on the market Thursday and Friday and could become a bigger headwind.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was heading for a weekly gain of 3%, its second weekly gain in three. A big catalyst came Monday, when Moderna disclosed positive data from a small group of patients in an early trial, but it was a wild week of trading for the company’s stock as doubts arose about its limited results. On Friday, however, White House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said the data showed promise and he was cautiously optimistic a vaccine would be developed.
*****
&gt; Astra Zeneca’s vaccine effort got a boost this week when it received $1 billion from the U.S. Health Department’s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority to develop a coronavirus vaccine from the University of Oxford.
*****
&gt; With investors focused on vaccines and state reopenings, market winners were the more volatile Russell 2000, up 7.8% for the week and the Dow Transports, up nearly 9.1% as airlines and other reopening stocks rallied. Airlines were up nearly 20% on the week. After a batch of earnings reports, retailers were also higher on the week, with the SPDR S&amp;P Retail ETF up 6% for the week.
*****
&gt; Retailers are again among the companies reporting earnings in the week ahead, as the first quarter reporting season winds down. Costco, Nordstrom, Ulta Beauty and Burlington Stores are some of the names reporting.
*****
&gt; Keon said he is watching the economic reopenings and says the success really depends on the behavior of individuals, and whether there’s another spike in infections.
*****
&gt; “People are still scared,” he said. “It’s the personal behavior that’s going to make a difference to economic behavior. We’ll get back to some semblance of normal. It’s going to take awhile for people to feel more confident.”
*****
&gt; He expects to see a rebound of economic activity in the second half of the year, but not a V-shaped recovery.
*****
&gt; “By the end of the year, if we don’t get a vaccine, we will have made a lot of progress on a vaccine. I’m still cautiously optimistic that the market can hang in, and maybe end the year a little bit higher,” he said.
*****
&gt; One big reopening in the week ahead will be on Tuesday when the iconic NYSE trading floor reopens.

# Weekly Market Performance – May 22, 2020: Stocks Solid in the Midst of Health and Political Challenges

&gt; # Equities

&gt; US equities delivered solid returns this week. With three hours to go in the week, all three markets were up almost 3% for the week, with the best performer, once again, the technology-heavy Nasdaq. The small cap Russell 2000 Index enjoyed an impressive rally, with the index returning over 9% for the week. The mid-cap S&amp;P 400 Index also had a solid showing, returning almost 9%.

&gt; Amid ongoing COVID-19 disruptions, rising unemployment, and risks associated with reopening the economy, US stocks continued to rebound. The rally was supported by all 50 states easing restrictions, based on improving COIVD-19 trends. Several timely indicators have pointed to a pickup in economic activity, including higher credit and debit card spending and an increase in travelers based on TSA data. Second quarter gross domestic product (GDP) could contract as much as 30% annualized, but global progress in reopening economies combined with massive stimulus measures point to a potentially strong rebound in the third and fourth quarters.

&gt; “The S&amp;P 500 just had the second-best 40-day rally ever, with only the returns off the March 2009 lows better,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Near-term, we have some concerns of a well-deserved pullback, but historically, these huge moves have tended to resolve much higher over the ensuing 6- and 12-month periods.”

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.22.20-wmp.jpg?ssl=1))**

&gt; In a change of pace, industrials were the top-performing sector for the week, followed by the energy sector. The worst-performing sectors were healthcare and consumer staples, and they posted returns that were slightly negative for the week. Looking at style, large cap value stocks edged out large cap growth for the week.

# Leading Indicators Signal Potential Bottom

&gt; Leading economic indicators are signaling that the pace of economic deterioration may be slowing. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index (LEI), a composite of leading data series, fell 4.4% month over month in April. While this is an undeniably abysmal reading, it is an improvement from the -7.4% in March.

&gt; ”The monthly LEI change tends to bottom early in a recession, and sometimes even before a recession’s official start,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Stocks are forward looking, so if investors feel confident that the economic damage will not accelerate from here, they may be more willing to put capital to work. We think today’s LEI number largely confirms April’s strong moves in the equity markets.”

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Economic-news-5.22.20.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; The performance of the 10 underlying components in the LEI does indicate some disconnect between financial markets and the real economy. The two largest positive contributors to the headline LEI number this month were stock prices and the interest rate spread, which were buoyed by a swift and robust monetary and fiscal stimulus. Meanwhile, data series related to manufacturing, unemployment, and construction hurt the index, a reflection of the damage done to the parts of the economy in which workers are unable to perform their jobs remotely.

&gt; As local economies begin to reopen, we look for the industries disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 virus to begin to rebound. While this will likely be a bumpy process, progress will likely become evident in future LEI releases and confirm that the worst of the economic declines are behind us. We think this should pave the way for further equity gains over a long-term horizon.

# What Happens When The Bear Ends?

&gt; The incredible rally off the March 23 lows continues for equities, with the S&amp;P 500 Index now up more than 32% in 40 trading days. As impressive as the rally has been, we do have some near-term concerns, as we discussed in Downside Risk Remains. Higher valuations, US-/China relations, weakening technicals, and the historically troublesome summer months all could play a part in potential weakness after the record run.

&gt; “In 40 trading days, the S&amp;P 500 gained 32%, which is second only to the 40 days off the March 2009 lows,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Looking back at history shows that after the initial surge off of bear lows, stocks tend to correct about 10%, which is something we could see this time around.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 rallied nearly 21% in 30 days after all major bear markets. But once those initial rallies ended, there was a correction of more than 10% on average. Bottoms are a process, and as impressive as this run has been, we think the odds are quite high for some type of pullback or correction over the coming months. Thanks to our friends at Strategas Research Partners for the data points below.

# Bottom Line EPS Beat Rate Below Average

&gt; The first quarter earnings reporting period unofficially came to an end earlier this week, and it should be considered quite a success given how well the equity market performed during this time period. Since earnings season began on April 13th, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) has gained more than 5%. Of course, the market's performance over the last month or so has much more to do with expectations on re-opening than how companies reported in Q1, but all things considered, the sky didn't fall when it came to earnings results.

&gt; In terms of how actual earnings reports came in versus analyst expectations this past earnings season, the trend wasn't all that rosy. We've been tracking ""beat rates"" for more than a decade, which measure the percentage of companies reporting stronger than expected EPS and sales numbers (relative to consensus analyst estimates). Our main ""beat rate"" trackers show beat rates on a rolling 3-month basis -- meaning it looks at all companies that have reported earnings over the last three months and tells you what percentage of them beat analyst estimates.

&gt; Below is a snapshot of both bottom-line EPS and top-line sales beat rates over the last five years as displayed on our website at our ""Earnings Explorer"" page. Notably, bottom-line EPS beat rates have been weakening quite dramatically over the last couple of months since the COVID crisis began. Just this week, the 3-month rolling EPS beat rate dipped below its long-term average of 59.37% dating back to the year 2000.

&gt; On the other hand, top-line sales beat rates haven't taken quite the hit yet. The current sales beat rate stands at 60.67%. While sales on an absolute basis fell dramatically at the end of Q1, the fact that sales beat rates haven't fallen dramatically means companies have at least managed to keep up with analyst expectations. A very weak sales beat rate would have meant companies were reporting numbers even weaker than already dour analyst expectations.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/epsbeats.png))**

&gt; We also have a forward guidance tracker that measures the percentage of companies raising guidance versus the percentage of companies lowering guidance. When this reading turns negative, it means more companies have lowered guidance than raised guidance over the last three months. As shown below, right now our guidance spread stands at -16.08 percentage points, which is the weakest reading we've seen since early 2016.

&gt; One thing we've seen since the COVID crisis began is that more and more companies have withdrawn guidance altogether. It's hard to blame them. The ones that have issued guidance have mostly lowered expectations. While this paints a bleak picture for the future, if you look at this from a ""glass half full"" perspective, it actually leaves much more room for positive surprises down the road.

# S&amp;P 500 Down Five Straight Day After Memorial Day

&gt; Our office will be closed for observance of Memorial Day on Monday, May 25. U.S stock and bond markets will also be closed. As you spend some quality time off please consider taking time to commemorate those who have paid the ultimate price while serving in the U.S. military. Additionally, consider taking a moment to acknowledge first responders, nurses, doctors, law enforcement, firefighters, essential workers, scientists and everyone else that has tirelessly worked and sacrificed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

&gt; For decades the Stock Trader’s Almanac has been tracking and monitoring the market’s performance around holidays. The trading day after Memorial Day has a mixed record going back to 1971. Both S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have declined more often than risen on the day, but average performance is still modestly positive. Since 1986, the frequency of gains has improved, and average performance has also risen however, over the last five years S&amp;P 500 has declined. The second trading day after Memorial Day has more advances than declines, but average performance is negative for NASDAQ. The third day after appears to have the best long- and short-term record combined with solid average performance.

# Election-Year June: Candidate Clarity Boosts Performance

&gt; June has shone brighter on NASDAQ stocks over the last 49 years as a rule ranking seventh with a 0.8% average gain, up 27 of 49 years. This contributes to NASDAQ’s “Best Eight Months” which ends in June. June ranks near the bottom on the Dow Jones Industrials just above September since 1950 with an average loss of 0.2%. S&amp;P 500 performs similarly poorly, ranking tenth, but essentially flat (0.1% average gain). Small caps also tend to fare well in June. Russell 2000 has averaged 0.8% in the month since 1979.

&gt; In election years since 1950, June’s performance improves notably. June is the #5 DJIA month in election years averaging a 0.9% gain with a record of twelve advances in seventeen years. For S&amp;P 500, June is #2 with an average gain of 1.3% (14-3 record). Election-year June ranks #4 for NASDAQ and Russell 2000 with average gains of 1.6% and 1.4% respectively. This performance improvement is most likely the result of presidential candidate field being sufficiently narrowed, and the ultimate nominees being identified.

107,DELL,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning May 25th, 2020","Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 25th, 2020.

# **Market could get a boost as states reopen, but new economic data will show just how bad things got during shutdowns  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/22/market-could-get-a-boost-as-states-reopen-but-new-economic-data-will-show-just-how-bad-things-got-during-shutdowns.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks are likely to hang on every medical development and the progress of state reopenings, but there will also be some key economic data in the coming week that should provide a glimpse into the depths of the state shutdowns.
*****
&gt; The Fed’s beige book of economic activity is released Wednesday afternoon. There is also April manufacturing data in durable goods Thursday and April’s consumer income and spending data Friday. While that should provide an interesting view of how sluggish activity became, the market is expected to focus more on May consumer confidence Tuesday and consumer sentiment Friday.
*****
&gt; “The backward looking data is not going to get any attention paid to it,” said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. “It’s going to be terrible, and that’s not going to be a surprise. Confidence has held up pretty well, all things considered. It’s the PPP and unemployment benefits. People who get some support for income seem to be pretty confident.” Congress is expected to take up changes to the Paycheck Protection Program for small business when it returns June 1.
*****
&gt; April’s economic data is expected to be about the worst of the recession, since most state shutdowns extended through a good part of the month, ahead of May reopenings. First quarter gross domestic product is expected to have declined by 4.8% when a second reading is released Wednesday, but for the second quarter, GDP is expected to decline by a median 33.1%, according to CNBC/Moody’s Analytics Rapid Update, a survey of economists.
*****
&gt; Stocks gained in the past week, though rising tensions between the U.S. and China weighed on the market Thursday and Friday and could become a bigger headwind.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was heading for a weekly gain of 3%, its second weekly gain in three. A big catalyst came Monday, when Moderna disclosed positive data from a small group of patients in an early trial, but it was a wild week of trading for the company’s stock as doubts arose about its limited results. On Friday, however, White House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said the data showed promise and he was cautiously optimistic a vaccine would be developed.
*****
&gt; Astra Zeneca’s vaccine effort got a boost this week when it received $1 billion from the U.S. Health Department’s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority to develop a coronavirus vaccine from the University of Oxford.
*****
&gt; With investors focused on vaccines and state reopenings, market winners were the more volatile Russell 2000, up 7.8% for the week and the Dow Transports, up nearly 9.1% as airlines and other reopening stocks rallied. Airlines were up nearly 20% on the week. After a batch of earnings reports, retailers were also higher on the week, with the SPDR S&amp;P Retail ETF up 6% for the week.
*****
&gt; Retailers are again among the companies reporting earnings in the week ahead, as the first quarter reporting season winds down. Costco, Nordstrom, Ulta Beauty and Burlington Stores are some of the names reporting.
*****
&gt; Keon said he is watching the economic reopenings and says the success really depends on the behavior of individuals, and whether there’s another spike in infections.
*****
&gt; “People are still scared,” he said. “It’s the personal behavior that’s going to make a difference to economic behavior. We’ll get back to some semblance of normal. It’s going to take awhile for people to feel more confident.”
*****
&gt; He expects to see a rebound of economic activity in the second half of the year, but not a V-shaped recovery.
*****
&gt; “By the end of the year, if we don’t get a vaccine, we will have made a lot of progress on a vaccine. I’m still cautiously optimistic that the market can hang in, and maybe end the year a little bit higher,” he said.
*****
&gt; One big reopening in the week ahead will be on Tuesday when the iconic NYSE trading floor reopens.

# Weekly Market Performance – May 22, 2020: Stocks Solid in the Midst of Health and Political Challenges

&gt; # Equities

&gt; US equities delivered solid returns this week. With three hours to go in the week, all three markets were up almost 3% for the week, with the best performer, once again, the technology-heavy Nasdaq. The small cap Russell 2000 Index enjoyed an impressive rally, with the index returning over 9% for the week. The mid-cap S&amp;P 400 Index also had a solid showing, returning almost 9%.

&gt; Amid ongoing COVID-19 disruptions, rising unemployment, and risks associated with reopening the economy, US stocks continued to rebound. The rally was supported by all 50 states easing restrictions, based on improving COIVD-19 trends. Several timely indicators have pointed to a pickup in economic activity, including higher credit and debit card spending and an increase in travelers based on TSA data. Second quarter gross domestic product (GDP) could contract as much as 30% annualized, but global progress in reopening economies combined with massive stimulus measures point to a potentially strong rebound in the third and fourth quarters.

&gt; “The S&amp;P 500 just had the second-best 40-day rally ever, with only the returns off the March 2009 lows better,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Near-term, we have some concerns of a well-deserved pullback, but historically, these huge moves have tended to resolve much higher over the ensuing 6- and 12-month periods.”

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.22.20-wmp.jpg?ssl=1))**

&gt; In a change of pace, industrials were the top-performing sector for the week, followed by the energy sector. The worst-performing sectors were healthcare and consumer staples, and they posted returns that were slightly negative for the week. Looking at style, large cap value stocks edged out large cap growth for the week.

# Leading Indicators Signal Potential Bottom

&gt; Leading economic indicators are signaling that the pace of economic deterioration may be slowing. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index (LEI), a composite of leading data series, fell 4.4% month over month in April. While this is an undeniably abysmal reading, it is an improvement from the -7.4% in March.

&gt; ”The monthly LEI change tends to bottom early in a recession, and sometimes even before a recession’s official start,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Stocks are forward looking, so if investors feel confident that the economic damage will not accelerate from here, they may be more willing to put capital to work. We think today’s LEI number largely confirms April’s strong moves in the equity markets.”

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Economic-news-5.22.20.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; The performance of the 10 underlying components in the LEI does indicate some disconnect between financial markets and the real economy. The two largest positive contributors to the headline LEI number this month were stock prices and the interest rate spread, which were buoyed by a swift and robust monetary and fiscal stimulus. Meanwhile, data series related to manufacturing, unemployment, and construction hurt the index, a reflection of the damage done to the parts of the economy in which workers are unable to perform their jobs remotely.

&gt; As local economies begin to reopen, we look for the industries disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 virus to begin to rebound. While this will likely be a bumpy process, progress will likely become evident in future LEI releases and confirm that the worst of the economic declines are behind us. We think this should pave the way for further equity gains over a long-term horizon.

# What Happens When The Bear Ends?

&gt; The incredible rally off the March 23 lows continues for equities, with the S&amp;P 500 Index now up more than 32% in 40 trading days. As impressive as the rally has been, we do have some near-term concerns, as we discussed in Downside Risk Remains. Higher valuations, US-/China relations, weakening technicals, and the historically troublesome summer months all could play a part in potential weakness after the record run.

&gt; “In 40 trading days, the S&amp;P 500 gained 32%, which is second only to the 40 days off the March 2009 lows,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Looking back at history shows that after the initial surge off of bear lows, stocks tend to correct about 10%, which is something we could see this time around.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 rallied nearly 21% in 30 days after all major bear markets. But once those initial rallies ended, there was a correction of more than 10% on average. Bottoms are a process, and as impressive as this run has been, we think the odds are quite high for some type of pullback or correction over the coming months. Thanks to our friends at Strategas Research Partners for the data points below.

# Bottom Line EPS Beat Rate Below Average

&gt; The first quarter earnings reporting period unofficially came to an end earlier this week, and it should be considered quite a success given how well the equity market performed during this time period. Since earnings season began on April 13th, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) has gained more than 5%. Of course, the market's performance over the last month or so has much more to do with expectations on re-opening than how companies reported in Q1, but all things considered, the sky didn't fall when it came to earnings results.

&gt; In terms of how actual earnings reports came in versus analyst expectations this past earnings season, the trend wasn't all that rosy. We've been tracking ""beat rates"" for more than a decade, which measure the percentage of companies reporting stronger than expected EPS and sales numbers (relative to consensus analyst estimates). Our main ""beat rate"" trackers show beat rates on a rolling 3-month basis -- meaning it looks at all companies that have reported earnings over the last three months and tells you what percentage of them beat analyst estimates.

&gt; Below is a snapshot of both bottom-line EPS and top-line sales beat rates over the last five years as displayed on our website at our ""Earnings Explorer"" page. Notably, bottom-line EPS beat rates have been weakening quite dramatically over the last couple of months since the COVID crisis began. Just this week, the 3-month rolling EPS beat rate dipped below its long-term average of 59.37% dating back to the year 2000.

&gt; On the other hand, top-line sales beat rates haven't taken quite the hit yet. The current sales beat rate stands at 60.67%. While sales on an absolute basis fell dramatically at the end of Q1, the fact that sales beat rates haven't fallen dramatically means companies have at least managed to keep up with analyst expectations. A very weak sales beat rate would have meant companies were reporting numbers even weaker than already dour analyst expectations.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/epsbeats.png))**

&gt; We also have a forward guidance tracker that measures the percentage of companies raising guidance versus the percentage of companies lowering guidance. When this reading turns negative, it means more companies have lowered guidance than raised guidance over the last three months. As shown below, right now our guidance spread stands at -16.08 percentage points, which is the weakest reading we've seen since early 2016.

&gt; One thing we've seen since the COVID crisis began is that more and more companies have withdrawn guidance altogether. It's hard to blame them. The ones that have issued guidance have mostly lowered expectations. While this paints a bleak picture for the future, if you look at this from a ""glass half full"" perspective, it actually leaves much more room for positive surprises down the road.

# S&amp;P 500 Down Five Straight Day After Memorial Day

&gt; Our office will be closed for observance of Memorial Day on Monday, May 25. U.S stock and bond markets will also be closed. As you spend some quality time off please consider taking time to commemorate those who have paid the ultimate price while serving in the U.S. military. Additionally, consider taking a moment to acknowledge first responders, nurses, doctors, law enforcement, firefighters, essential workers, scientists and everyone else that has tirelessly worked and sacrificed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

&gt; For decades the Stock Trader’s Almanac has been tracking and monitoring the market’s performance around holidays. The trading day after Memorial Day has a mixed record going back to 1971. Both S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have declined more often than risen on the day, but average performance is still modestly positive. Since 1986, the frequency of gains has improved, and average performance has also risen however, over the last five years S&amp;P 500 has declined. The second trading day after Memorial Day has more advances than declines, but average performance is negative for NASDAQ. The third day after appears to have the best long- and short-term record combined with solid average performance.

# Election-Year June: Candidate Clarity Boosts Performance

&gt; June has shone brighter on NASDAQ stocks over the last 49 years as a rule ranking seventh with a 0.8% average gain, up 27 of 49 years. This contributes to NASDAQ’s “Best Eight Months” which ends in June. June ranks near the bottom on the Dow Jones Industrials just above September since 1950 with an average loss of 0.2%. S&amp;P 500 performs similarly poorly, ranking tenth, but essentially flat (0.1% average gain). Small caps also tend to fare well in June. Russell 2000 has averaged 0.8% in the month since 1979.

&gt; In election years since 1950, June’s performance improves notably. June is the #5 DJIA month in election years averaging a 0.9% gain with a record of twelve advances in seventeen years. For S&amp;P 500, June is #2 with an average gain of 1.3% (14-3 record). Election-year June ranks #4 for NASDAQ and Russell 2000 with average gains of 1.6% and 1.4% respectively. This performance improvement is most likely the result of presidential candidate field being sufficiently narrowed, and the ultimate nominees being identified.

136,DELL,Don’t miss the Tech 🚂🚂,"What up, what up, what up. Ima take advantage that this cocai-I mean coffee just hit me and give y’all some juicy calls for next week. If y’all been following, my past 2 posts have been smooth as baby cheeks. JD, PLT &amp; BJ have been a Stephen Curry swish so far. Alright let’s get to the point.


HPQ &amp; DELL. Yes you heard right this two veteran companies have their earnings calls next week DELL 5/27, HPQ 5/28. As we know, both companies took a downfall this March and have slowly but steady been on the come up to their regular pre-covid prices. Wall Street sees plenty of upside for these tech stocks after their earnings just like we seen with other tech companies that did pretty well this Q.
They’ve been gaining some momentum already but I don’t think it’s too late to hop in this train. Both companies took a hit yesterday but nothing major so it’s a perfect time to buy in at a good price. I recommend to follow closely today and see if there is another dip and get your calls! 

Positions: DELL 6/19 47.5c (you can totally go for 50)
                  HPQ 5/29 17c 

If you want to play it safe try to get a closest ITM call for DELL since their earnings call comes first. If they do good it’ll carry a good momentum for HPQ.

137,DELL,NVidia – Know What You Own,"How many people really understand what they’re buying, especially when it comes to highly specialized hardware companies? Most NVidia investors seem to be relying on a vague idea of how the company should thrive “in the future”, as their GPUs are ostensibly used for Artificial Intelligence, Cloud, holograms, etc. Having been shocked by how this company is represented in the media, I decided to lay out how this business works, doing my part to fight for reality. With what’s been going on in markets, I don’t like my chances but here goes:

Let’s start with…

**How does NVDA make money?**

NVDA is in the business of semiconductor design. As a simplified image in your head, you can imagine this as designing very detailed and elaborate posters. Their engineers create circuit patterns for printing onto semiconductor wafers. NVDA then pays a semiconductor foundry (the printer – generally TSMC) to create chips with those patterns on them.

Simply put, NVDA’s profits represent the difference between the price at which they can sell those chips, less the cost of printing, and less the cost of paying their engineers to design them.

Notably, after the foundry prints the chips, NVDA also has to pay (I say pay, but really it is more like “sell at a discount to”) their “add-in board” (AIB) partners to stick the chips onto printed circuit boards (what you might imagine as green things with a bunch of capacitors on them). That leads to the final form in which buyers experience the GPU.

**What is a GPU?**

NVDA designs chips called GPUs (Graphical Processing Units). Initially, GPUs were used for the rapid processing and creation of images, but their use cases have expanded over time. You may be familiar with the CPU (Central Processing Unit). CPUs sit at the core of a computer system, doing most of the calculation, taking orders from the operating system (e.g. Windows, Linux), etc. AMD and Intel make CPUs. GPUs assist the CPU with certain tasks. You can think of the CPU as having a few giant very powerful engines. The GPU has a lot of small much less powerful engines. Sometimes you have to do a lot of really simple tasks that don’t require powerful engines to complete. Here, the act of engaging the powerful engines is a waste of time, as you end up spending most of your time revving them up and revving them down. In that scenario, it helps the CPU to hand that task over to the GPU in order to “accelerate” the completion of the task. The GPU only revs up a small engine for each task, and is able to rev up all the small engines simultaneously to knock out a large number of these simple tasks at the same time. Remember the GPU has lots of engines. The GPU also has an edge in interfacing a lot with memory but let’s not get too technical.

**Who uses NVDA’s GPUs?**

There are two main broad end markets for NVDA’s GPUs – Gaming and Professional. Let’s dig into each one:

**The Gaming Market:**

A Bit of Ancient History (**Skip if impatient**)

GPUs were first heavily used for gaming in arcades. They then made their way to consoles, and finally PCs. NVDA started out in the PC phase of GPU gaming usage. They weren’t the first company in the space, but they made several good moves that ultimately led to a very strong market position. Firstly, they focused on selling into OEMs – guys like the equivalent of today’s DELL/HP/Lenovo – , which allowed a small company to get access to a big market without having to create a lot of relationships. Secondly, they focused on the design aspect of the GPU, and relied on their Asian supply chain to print the chip, to package the chip and to install in on a printed circuit board – the Asian supply chain ended up being the best in semis. But the insight that really let NVDA dominate was noticing that some GPU manufacturers were focusing on keeping hardware-accelerated Transform and Lighting as a Professional GPU feature. As a start-up, with no professional GPU business to disrupt, NVidia decided their best ticket into the big leagues was blowing up the market by including this professional grade feature into their gaming product. It worked – and this was a real masterstroke – the visual and performance improvements were extraordinary. 3DFX, the initial leader in PC gaming GPUs, was vanquished, and importantly it happened when funding markets shut down with the tech bubble bursting and after 3DFX made some large ill-advised acquisitions. Consequently 3DFX, went from hero to zero, and NVDA bought them for a pittance out of bankruptcy, acquiring the best IP portfolio in the industry.

**Some more Modern History**

This is what NVDA’s pure gaming card revenue looks like over time – NVDA only really broke these out in 2005 (note by pure, this means ex-Tegra revenues):

📷 [https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394577731223552/tumblr\_Ikb8g9Cu9sxh2ERno](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394577731223552/tumblr_Ikb8g9Cu9sxh2ERno)

So what is the history here? Well, back in the late 90s when GPUs were first invented, they were **required** to play any 3D game. As discussed in the early history above, NVDA landed a hit product to start with early and got a strong burst of growth: revenues of 160M in 1998 went to 1900M in 2002. But then NVDA ran into strong competition from ATI (later purchased and currently owned by AMD). While NVDA’s sales struggled to stay flat from 2002 to 2004, ATI’s doubled from 1Bn to 2Bn. NVDA’s next major win came in 2006, with the 8000 series. ATI was late with a competing product, and NVDA’s sales skyrocketed – as can be seen in the graph above. With ATI being acquired by AMD they were unfocused for some time, and NVDA was able to keep their lead for an extended period. Sales slowed in 2008/2009 but that was due to the GFC – people don’t buy expensive GPU hardware in recessions.

And then we got to 2010 and the tide changed. Growth in desktop PCs ended. Here is a chart from Statista:

📷[https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394674172919808/tumblr\_OgCnNwTyqhMhAE9r9](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394674172919808/tumblr_OgCnNwTyqhMhAE9r9)

This resulted in two negative secular trends for Nvidia. Firstly, with the decline in popularity of desktop PCs, growth in gaming GPUs faded as well (below is a chart from Jon Peddie). Note that NVDA sells discrete GPUs, aka DT (Desktop) Discrete. Integrated GPUs are mainly made by Intel (these sit on the motherboard or with the CPU).

📷 [https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394688079200256/tumblr\_rTtKwOlHPIVUj8e7h](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394688079200256/tumblr_rTtKwOlHPIVUj8e7h)

You can see from the chart above that discrete desktop GPU sales are fading faster than integrated GPU sales. This is the other secular trend hurting NVDA’s gaming business. Integrated GPUs are getting better and better, taking over a wider range of tasks that were previously the domain of the discrete GPU. Surprisingly, the most popular eSports game of recent times – Fortnite – only requires Intel HD 4000 graphics – an Integrated GPU from 2012!

So at this point you might go back to NVDA’s gaming sales, and ask the question: What happened in 2015? How is NVDA overcoming these secular trends?

The answer consists of a few parts.Firstly, AMD dropped the ball in 2015. As you can see in this chart, sourced from 3DCenter, AMD market share was halved in 2015, due to a particularly poor product line-up:

📷 [https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394753459994624/tumblr\_J7vRw9y0QxMlfm6Xd](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394753459994624/tumblr_J7vRw9y0QxMlfm6Xd)

Following this, NVDA came out with Pascal in 2016 – a very powerful offering in the mid to high end part of the GPU market. At the same time, AMD was focusing on rebuilding and had no compelling mid or high end offerings. AMD mainly focused on maintaining scale in the very low end. Following that came 2017 and 2018: AMD’s offering was still very poor at the time, but cryptomining drove demand for GPUs to new levels, and AMD’s GPUs were more compelling from a price-performance standpoint for crypto mining initially, perversely leading to AMD gaining share. NVDA quickly remedied that by improving their drivers to better mine crypto, regaining their relative positioning, and profiting in a big way from the crypto boom. Supply that was calibrated to meet gaming demand collided with cryptomining demand and Average Selling Prices of GPUs shot through the roof. Cryptominers bought top of the line GPUs aggressively.

A good way to see changes in crypto demand for GPUs is the mining profitability of Ethereum:

📷 [https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394769378443264/tumblr\_cmBtR9gm8T2NI9jmQ](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394769378443264/tumblr_cmBtR9gm8T2NI9jmQ)

This leads us to where we are today. 2019 saw gaming revenues drop for NVDA. Where are they likely to head?

The secular trends of falling desktop sales along with falling discrete GPU sales have reasserted themselves, as per the Jon Peddie research above. Cryptomining profitability has collapsed.

AMD has come out with a new architecture, NAVI, and the 5700XT – the first Iteration, competes effectively with NVDA in the mid-high end space on a price/performance basis. This is the first real competition from AMD since 2014.

NVDA can see all these trends, and they tried to respond. Firstly, with volumes clearly declining, and likely with a glut of second-hand GPUs that can make their way to gamers over time from the crypto space, NVDA decided to pursue a price over volume strategy. They released their most expensive set of GPUs by far in the latest Turing series. They added a new feature, Ray Tracing, by leveraging the Tensor Cores they had created for Professional uses, hoping to use that as justification for higher prices (more on this in the section on Professional GPUs). Unfortunately for NVDA, gamers have responded quite poorly to Ray Tracing – it caused performance issues, had poor support, poor adoption, and the visual improvements in most cases are not particularly noticeable or relevant.

The last recession led to gaming revenues falling 30%, despite NVDA being in a very strong position at the time vis-à-vis AMD – this time around their position is quickly slipping and it appears that the recession is going to be bigger. Additionally, the shift away from discrete GPUs in gaming continues.

To make matters worse for NVDA, AMD won the slots in both the New Xbox and the New PlayStation, coming out later this year. The performance of just the AMD GPU in those consoles looks to be competitive with NVidia products that currently retail for more than the entire console is likely to cost. Consider that usually you have to pair that NVidia GPU with a bunch of other expensive hardware. The pricing and margin impact of this console cycle on NVDA is likely to be very substantially negative.

It would be prudent to assume a greater than 30% fall in gaming revenues from the very elevated 2019 levels, with likely secular decline to follow.

**The Professional Market:**

A Bit of Ancient History (again, skip if impatient)

As it turns out, graphical accelerators were first used in the Professional market, long before they were employed for Gaming purposes. The big leader in the space was a company called Silicon Graphics, who sold workstations with custom silicon optimised for graphical processing. Their sales were only $25Mn in 1985, but by 1997 they were doing 3.6Bn in revenue – truly exponential growth. Unfortunately for them, from that point on, discrete GPUs took over, and their highly engineered, customised workstations looked exorbitantly expensive in comparison. Sales sank to 500mn by 2006 and, with no profits in sight, they ended up filing for bankruptcy in 2009. Competition is harsh in the semiconductor industry.

Initially, the Professional market centred on visualisation and design, but it has changed over time. There were a lot of players and lot of nuance, but I am going to focus on more recent times, as they are more relevant to NVidia.

**Some More Modern History**

NVDA’s Professional business started after its gaming business, but we don’t have revenue disclosures that show exactly when it became relevant. This is what we do have – going back to 2005:

📷 [https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394785029472256/tumblr\_fEcYAzdstyh6tqIsI](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394785029472256/tumblr_fEcYAzdstyh6tqIsI)

In the beginning, Professional revenues were focused on the 3D visualisation end of the spectrum, with initial sales going into workstations that were edging out the customised builds made by Silicon Graphics. Fairly quickly, however, GPUs added more and more functionality and started to turn into general parallel data processors rather than being solely optimised towards graphical processing.

As this change took place, people in scientific computing noticed, and started using GPUs to accelerate scientific workloads that involve very parallel computation, such as matrix manipulation. This started at the workstation level, but by 2007 NVDA decided to make a new line-up of Tesla series cards specifically suited to scientific computing. The professional segment now have several points of focus:

1. GPUs used in workstations for things such as CAD graphical processing (Quadro Line)
2. GPUs used in workstations for computational workloads such as running engineering simulations (Quadro Line)
3. GPUs used in workstations for machine learning applications (Quadro line.. but can use gaming cards as well for this)
4. GPUs used by enterprise customers for high performance computing (such as modelling oil wells) (Tesla Line)
5. GPUs used by enterprise customers for machine learning projects (Tesla Line)
6. GPUs used by hyperscalers (mostly for machine learning projects) (Tesla Line)

In more recent times, given the expansion of the Tesla line, NVDA has broken up reporting into Professional Visualisation (Quadro Line) and Datacenter (Tesla Line). Here are the revenue splits since that reporting started:

It is worth stopping here and thinking about the huge increase in sales delivered by the Tesla line. The reason for this huge boom is the sudden increase in interest in numerical techniques for machine learning. Let’s go on a brief detour here to understand what machine learning is, because a lot of people want to hype it but not many want to tell you what it actually is. I have the misfortune of being very familiar with the industry, which prevented me from buying into the hype. Oops – sometimes it really sucks being educated.

**What is Machine Learning?**

At a very high level, machine learning is all about trying to get some sort of insight out of data. Most of the core techniques used in machine learning were developed a long time ago, in the 1950s and 1960s. The most common machine learning technique, which most people have heard of and may be vaguely familiar with, is called regression analysis. Regression analysis involves fitting a line through a bunch of datapoints. The most common type of regression analysis is called “Ordinary Least Squares” OLS regression, and that type of regression has a “closed form” solution, which means that there is a very simple calculation you can do to fit an OLS regression line to data.

As it happens, fitting a line through points is not only easy to do, it also tends to be the main machine learning technique that people want to use, because it is very intuitive. You can make good sense of what the data is telling you and can understand the machine learning model you are using. Obviously, regression analysis doesn’t require a GPU!

However, there is another consideration in machine learning: if you want to use a regression model, you still need a human to select the data that you want to fit the line through. Also, sometimes the relationship doesn’t look like a line, but rather it might look like a curve. In this case, you need a human to “transform” the data before you fit a line through it in order to make the relationship linear.

So people had another idea here: what if instead of getting a person to select the right data to analyse, and the right model to apply, you could just get a computer to do that? Of course the problem with that is that computers are really stupid. They have no preconceived notion of what data to use or what relationship would make sense, so what they do is TRY EVERYTHING! And everything involves trying a hell of a lot of stuff. And trying a hell of a lot of stuff, most of which is useless garbage, involves a huge amount of computation. People tried this for a while through to the 1980s, decided it was useless, and dropped it… until recently.

What changed? Well we have more data now, and we have a lot more computing power, so we figured lets have another go at it. As it happens, the premier technique for trying a hell of a lot of stuff (99.999% of which is garbage you throw away) is called “Deep Learning”. Deep learning is SUPER computationally intensive, and that computation happens to involve a lot of matrix multiplication. And guess what just happens to have been doing a lot of matrix multiplication? GPUs!

Here is a chart that, for obvious reasons, lines up extremely well with the boom in Tesla GPU sales:

📷 [https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394825774989312/tumblr\_IZ3ayFDB0CsGdYVHW](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394825774989312/tumblr_IZ3ayFDB0CsGdYVHW)

Now we need to realise a few things here. Deep Learning is not some magic silver bullet. There are specific applications where it has proven very useful – primarily areas that have a very large number of very weak relationships between bits of data that sum up into strong relationships. An example of ones of those is Google Translate. On the other hand, in most analytical tasks, it is most useful to have an intuitive understanding of the data and to fit a simple and sensible model to it that is explainable. Deep learning models are not explainable in an intuitive manner. This is not only because they are complicated, but also because their scattershot technique of trying everything leaves a huge amount of garbage inside the model that cancels itself out when calculating the answer, but it is hard to see how it cancels itself out when stepping through it.

Given the quantum of hype on Deep learning and the space in general, many companies are using “Deep Learning”, “Machine Learning” and “AI” as marketing. Not many companies are actually generating significant amounts of tangible value from Deep Learning.

**Back to the Competitive Picture**

**For the Tesla Segment**

So NVDA happened to be in the right place at the right time to benefit from the Deep Learning hype. They happened to have a product ready to go and were able to charge a pretty penny for their product. But what happens as we proceed from here?

Firstly, it looks like the hype from Deep Learning has crested, which is not great from a future demand perspective. Not only that, but we really went from people having no GPUs, to people having GPUs. The next phase is people upgrading their old GPUs. It is much harder to sell an upgrade than to make the first sale.

Not only that, but GPUs are not the ideal manifestation of silicon for Deep Learning. NVDA themselves effectively admitted that with their latest iteration in the Datacentre, called Ampere. High Performance Computing, which was the initial use case for Tesla GPUs, was historically all about double precision floating point calculations (FP64). High precision calculations are required for simulations in aerospace/oil &amp; gas/automotive.

NVDA basically sacrificed HPC and shifted further towards Deep Learning with Ampere, announced last Thursday. The FP64 performance of the A100 (the latest Ampere chip) increased a fairly pedestrian 24% from the V100, increasing from 7.8 to 9.7 TF. Not a surprise that NVDA lost El Capitan to AMD, given this shift away from a focus on HPC. Instead, NVDA jacked up their Tensor Cores (i.e. not the GPU cores) and focused very heavily on FP16 computation (a lot less precise than FP64). As it turns out, FP16 is precise enough for Deep Learning, and NVDA recognises that. The future industry standard is likely to be BFloat 16 – the format pioneered by Google, who lead in Deep Learning. Ampere now does 312 TF of BF16, which compares to the 420 TF of Google’s TPU V3 – Google’s Machine Learning specific processor. Not quite up to the 2018 board from Google, but getting better – if they cut out all of the Cuda cores and GPU functionality maybe they could get up to Google’s spec.

And indeed this is the problem for NVDA: when you make a GPU it has a large number of different use cases, and you provide a single product that meets all of these different use cases. That is a very hard thing to do, and explains why it has been difficult for competitors to muscle into the GPU space. On the other hand, when you are making a device that does one thing, such as deep learning, it is a much simpler thing to do. Google managed to do it with no GPU experience and is still ahead of NVDA. It is likely that Intel will be able to enter this space successfully, as they have widely signalled with the Xe.

There is of course the other large negative driver for Deep Learning, and that is the recession we are now in. Demand for GPU instances on Amazon has collapsed across the board, as evidenced by the fall in pricing. The below graph shows one example: this data is for renting out a single Tesla V100 GPU on AWS, which isthe typical thing to do in an early exploratory phase for a Deep Learning model:

📷 [https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618396177958944768/tumblr\_Q86inWdeCwgeakUvh](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618396177958944768/tumblr_Q86inWdeCwgeakUvh)

With Deep Learning not delivering near-term tangible results, it is the first thing being cut. On their most recent conference call, IBM noted weakness in their cognitive division (AI), and noted weaker sales of their power servers, which is the line that houses Enterprise GPU servers at IBM. Facebook cancelled their AI residencies for this year, and Google pushed theirs out. Even if NVDA can put in a good quarter due to their new product rollout  (Ampere), the future is rapidly becoming a very stormy place.

**For the Quadro segment**

The Quadro segment has been a cash cow for a long time, generating dependable sales and solid margins. AMD just decided to rock the boat a bit. Sensing NVDA’s focus on Deep Learning, AMD seems to be focusing on HPC – the Radeon VII announced recently with a price point of $1899 takes aim at NVDAs most expensive Quadro, the GV100, priced at $8999. It does 6.5 TFLOPS of FP64 Double precision, whereas the GV100 does 7.4 – talk about shaking up a quiet segment.

**Pulling things together**

Let’s go back to what NVidia fundamentally does – paying their engineers to design chips, getting TSMC to print those chips, and getting board partners in Taiwan to turn them into the final product.

We have seen how a confluence of several pieces of extremely good fortune lined up to increase NVidia’s sales and profits tremendously: first on the Gaming side, weak competition from AMD until 2014, coupled with a great product in form of Pascal in 2016, followed by a huge crypto driven boom in 2017 and 2018, and on the Professional side, a sudden and unexpected increase in interest in Deep Learning driving Tesla demand from 2017-2019 sky high.

It is worth noting what these transient factors have done to margins. When unexpected good things happen to a chip company, sales go up a lot, but there are no costs associated with those sales. Strong demand means that you can sell each chip for a higher price, but no additional design work is required, and you still pay the printer, TSMC, the same amount of money. Consequently NVDA’s margins have gone up substantially: well above their 11.9% long term average to hit a peak of 33.2%, and more recently 26.5%:

📷 [https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618396192166100992/tumblr\_RiWaD0RLscq4midoP](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618396192166100992/tumblr_RiWaD0RLscq4midoP)

The question is, what would be a sensible margin going forward? Obviously 33% operating margin would attract a wall of competition and get competed away, which is why they can only be temporary. However, NVidia has shifted to having a greater proportion of its sales coming from non-OEM, and has a greater proportion of its sales coming from Professional rather than gaming. As such, maybe one can be generous and say NVDA can earn an 18% average operating margin over the next cycle. We can sense check these margins, using Intel. Intel has a long term average EBIT margin of about 25%. Intel happens to actually print the chips as well, so they collect a bigger fraction of the final product that they sell. NVDA, since it only does the design aspect, can’t earn a higher EBIT margin than Intel on average over the long term.

Tesla sales have likely gone too far and will moderate from here – perhaps down to a still more than respectable $2bn per year. Gaming resumes the long-term slide in discrete GPUs, which will likely be replaced by integrated GPUs to a greater and greater extent over time. But let’s be generous and say it maintains $3.5 Bn Per year for the add in board, and let’s assume we keep getting $750mn odd of Nintendo Switch revenues(despite that product being past peak of cycle, with Nintendo themselves forecasting a sales decline). Let’s assume AMD struggles to make progress in Quadro, despite undercutting NVDA on price by 75%, with continued revenues at $1200. Add on the other 1.2Bn of Automotive, OEM and IP (I am not even counting the fact that car sales have collapsed and Automotive is likely to be down big), and we would end up with revenues of $8.65 Bn, at an average operating margin of 20% through the cycle that would have $1.75Bn of operating earnings power, and if I say that the recent Mellanox acquisition manages to earn enough to pay for all the interest on NVDAs debt, and I assume a tax rate of 15% we would have around $1.5Bn in Net income.

This company currently has a market capitalisation of $209 Bn. It blows my mind that it trades on 139x what I consider to be fairly generous earnings – earnings that NVidia never even got close to seeing before the confluence of good luck hit them. But what really stuns me is the fact that investors are actually willing to extrapolate this chain of unlikely and positive events into the future.

Shockingly, Intel has a market cap of 245Bn, only 40Bn more than NVDA, but Intel’s sales and profits are 7x higher. And while Intel is facing competition from AMD, it is much more likely to hold onto those sales and profits than NVDA is. These are absolutely stunning valuation disparities.

If I didn’t see NVDA’s price, and I started from first principles and tried to calculate a prudent price for the company I would have estimated a$1.5Bn normalised profit, maybe on a 20x multiple giving them the benefit of the doubt despite heading into a huge recession, and considering the fact that there is not much debt and the company is very well run. That would give you a market cap of $30Bn, and a share price of $49. And it is currently $339. Wow. Obviously I’m short here!",1774,315,1589748775.0,2020-05-17T20:52:55+00:00,t3_gln51p,stocks

BRKB, I sold off positions in SLB, NOV and LYB and SEE and parked them here to lock in some profits, I'm interested to see what... if anything Warren buys... I'm hoping he's putting that cash to work.

CMG, wife loves Chipotle, thats my thesis, I just own this for fun.

Dell, just for this quarter... tried to buy another laptop to work from home last week, everything is sold out, they are going to have a solid quarter... if it goes to 50 I'll sell and move on.

EPR.. entertainment venue REIT... will hold a while since dividend is crazy and I think they will come out the other side of this.

GE... bought around 7, same play as part of BA... if they go to 10 I'll sell. Not in love with this but we will see.

HON... I work for them... I'm optimistic the quantum tech will open up some new markets, long term buy and hold. 

JPM and MS... bought them because, well, I don't exactly know but they looked cheap relative... seem like they are well run.

LL total gamble but I think people wrote it off, if they have ANY earnings this quarter or name a CEO I think it might fly... if it goes bankrupt I'm not out a lot but I feel like the risk/reward is there to dip toes in... all the home stores around me seem pretty busy so I guess the rationale makes sense in my head.

MRO marathon oil, energy play, haven't decided when to sell...

OKE... I think this is my favorite energy play, I also want to find companies that will benefit from cheap natural gas (but all the utilities seem expensive)

RTX... unless defense spending slows down this will rip higher.

SPR... So I bought a bunch at 16, more at 20, sold half at 36 and then bought more at 20... maybe one more pullback but any positive news for BA and this will double...

Anyway, for some reason my gut tells me we are going to find an equilibrium point soon and the markets will go sideways and IV will drop... I hope thats the case anyway... but there are a lot of dislocations that I believe still exist and I am curious about what other people are speculating on.

I know this isn't WSB... these make up about 20 % of my portfolio but its arguably the most interesting because it's the only part I am active with and its sort of fun to do the research on individual names and see if you can outperform short term.

109,DELL,Significant Activist Hedge Fund Activity (Last 7 Days),"These are the latest Schedule 13D forms filed by activist investors in the last 7 days. Activist
investors are investors that make an investment with the intention of influencing management in some way.
There is evidence that following activist investors into investments can generate excess returns.
Schedule 13G forms, in contrast, are filed by significant investors with no intention of influencing management
(such as Index funds).

There is always a lot of interest in insider trades, but what a lot of people probably don't realize
is that hedge fund activity is probably more predictive of future returns than insider activity.
The reason is that hedge funds (a) have large research budgets, and (b) have a choice where to put their money.
In contract, insiders have no choice where to put their money, but only when to time their transactions.

## New Filings
This table lists new 13D filings in the last week. A new filing does not necessarily indicate a new position,
as investors frequently accumulate in advance before reaching the filing threshold.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 25th, 2019.

# **Markets may get a boost from cheery Black Friday consumer sentiment, seasonal strength  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/22/markets-may-get-a-boost-from-cheery-black-friday-consumer-sentiment-seasonal-strength.html)**
*****
&gt; It’s Thanksgiving time, and investors’ thoughts turn to holiday shopping and a year end Santa rally in the stock market.
*****
&gt; Some analysts think both could be pretty good this year.
*****
&gt; While Black Friday has probably lost some of its claim as the launch of holiday shopping, the Friday after Thanksgiving could provide an early glimpse of how much the consumer will spend this year. The National Retail Federation estimates sales should grow by about 4% in the holiday shopping season, enough to keep the economy rolling along.
*****
&gt; JP Morgan analysts, in a note Friday, said they expect sales to be up 4.9% during the holidays, much stronger than last year, when sales gained just 1.9% and shoppers were discouraged by a major sell off in the stock market.
*****
&gt; As for the stock market, it continues to reach for new highs, and some analysts say that shouldn’t change as the calendar progresses deeper into a seasonally strong time of year for stocks.
*****
&gt; “I actually like adding to equities through the rest of the year,” said Cayman Wills, global head of equities at J.P. Morgan Private Bank.
*****
&gt; Wills said she is looking for a better economy, with now no concern about a recession next year. As a result, she began adding to industrials in September and now expects manufacturing data to turn around, supporting her view. She said, if ISM manufacturing data improves Dec. 2, as she expects, industrial company stocks should go even higher.
*****
&gt; The coming week is often a slow one, with markets closed Thursday for Thanksgiving and stock exchanges closing down early on Friday. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell speaks Monday night on the economy, and there are some economic reports worth watching, including durable goods and personal income and spending Wednesday.
*****
&gt; A few final earnings reports are also expected, including Best Buy, HP, and Dell.
*****
&gt; In the bond market, the Treasury auctions $113 billion in 2-year, 5-year and 7-year notes Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.
*****
&gt; Investors are also watching impeachment proceedings in the House, but analysts do not expect the potential impeachment of President Donald Trump to affect markets, since there is little chance he would be convicted by the Republican majority in the Senate.
*****
&gt; Developments on trade talks between the U.S. and China, are by far the most important event for markets.
*****
&gt; “It’s a call on trade in our view. You can’t really predict what Xi and Trump will do,” said Michael Schumacher, director rates, at Wells Fargo. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.75% Friday, from a high of 1.95% on Nov. 12. Rates have moved lower as concerns have increased that the U.S. and China will fail to reach a deal by Dec. 15, heading off a new round of tariffs expected to take effect that day.
*****
&gt; But stocks have not reacted as much to disappointing trade headlines, and are instead looking forward to a new round of talks between U.S. and Chinese officials. The S&amp;P 500 was roughly half percent away from its all time high Friday.
*****
&gt; “Trade is the nugget that helped lead the market higher,” Wills said. “In August we were trading at 16 times [earnings], now we’re at 17.8 times. If the market took out the benefit we saw from trade, it would probably be about 8% lower. That’s not our base case.”
*****
&gt; She expects to see some form of a phase one trade deal, and investors will continue to monitor every headline and tweet about trade talks. U.S. trade negotiators were invited to China to take part in a new round of face-to-face talks, according to the Wall Street Journal. On Friday, Trump said a deal was close.
*****
&gt; “I think there will be continued positive momentum,” said Wills, adding that incumbent presidents know a good economy is important in an election year.
*****
&gt; # Stocks could ‘turkey trot’ higher
&gt; The week around Thanksgiving is often positive for stocks. “If we were using history as a guide, that means we could see the final leg of this turkey trot in the week of Thanksgiving where we end [higher], then spend the next week or so digesting the recent gain,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.
*****
&gt; Stovall said there likely will be a Santa rally this year, but the market typically dips in the middle of December before moving higher. “December is the best month [for the S&amp;P 500]. On average, it’s up 1.6% and also has risen 76% of the time since World War II. It’s the highest price change and the best frequency for an up move of any month,” said Stovall.
*****
&gt; Scott Redler of T3Live. com said it’s very likely there will be a Santa rally taking the market higher into the end of December. “A lot of analysts have a target of 3,200 for this year, but we were a little ahead of ourselves. A week of digestion is welcome. Traders are looking to make sure the market holds 3,070 to 3,090 to give more confidence that the Santa rally could bring it to 3,200 by year end. The question is can the market hold these levels,” Redler said.
*****
&gt; The 3,090 level is the low from this past week, and the 21-day moving average, a momentum indicator, is at 3,075.
*****
&gt; “This week stocks took a little bit of a breather. Next week has a better chance of being seasonally strong,” he said. “This week was more of a breather than a break that could have happened on trade talks.”
*****
&gt; Retail will dominate in the week ahead, as markets watch the final group of store chains report earnings. Dollar Tree, Dick’s Sporting Goods and Best Buy report on Tuesday.
*****
&gt; Target in the past week gave positive indications for the holiday shopping season, as did Walmart the week before. But Home Depot lowered its sales forecast when it reported earnings, and Macy’s slashed its outlook..
*****
&gt; “There are six fewer days between Thanksgiving and Christmas but CFRA does not see this weighing on sales,” said Stovall. “Our analysts expect the tight time frame between Thanksgiving and Christmas will be a boon for retailers which have “buy-online-pickup-in-stores” capabilities.”
*****
&gt; Retail sales are important since the consumer drives more than two-thirds of the economy.
*****
&gt; “The peak of the season includes 27 days between Thanksgiving and Christmas compared to 33 days last year, which is the shortest since 2013. Notably, with Cyber Week and online penetration growing, this is less a risk than the days of yore while the shorter season will likely lessen the depth of the slowdown in early December,” the JP Morgan retail analysts wrote.

# Big Year-to-Date Gains Through November Bode Well for December and 2020

&gt; Going back to 1949 we are on pace for the 10th biggest year-to-date through November gains for the S&amp;P 500 – and it’s a healthy sign for the rest of the year and next. We crunched the numbers for the S&amp;P 500 YTD gains as of the end of November. Average YTD November gains are 7.4%. The list below shows the Top 21 YTD November that are all twice the average, which we felt best represents the current situation.

&gt; Following Decembers and following years have had solid performance and average to slightly better than average results. After big YTD gains December is up 71.4% of the time with an average gain of 1.7% and the next year is up 81.0% of the time with an average gain of 9.9%. The reinforces our positive outlook for the rest of 2019 and 2020.

# Average Performance Nearly Doubles in Pre-Election Year Decembers

&gt; December is now the number two S&amp;P 500 month and the third best month on the Dow Jones Industrials since 1950, averaging gains of 1.5% on each index. It’s the top Russell 2000 (1979) month and third best for NASDAQ (1971) and Russell 1000 (1979). Last year DJIA suffered its worst December performance since 1931 and its fourth worst December going all the way back to 1901. However, the market rarely falls precipitously in December and a repeat of last year is not that likely. When it does it is usually a turning point in the market—near a top or bottom. If the market has experienced fantastic gains leading up to December, stocks can pullback in the first half.

&gt; In pre-election years, December’s overall ranking remains about the same across the board however, average gains improve handsomely. DJIA averages 2.7%, S&amp;P 500 2.9%, NASDAQ 4.3%, Russell 1000 2.9% and Russell 2000 3.1%. DJIA has advanced in 13 of the last 17 pre-election year Decembers. DJIA’s worst pre-election December was in 2015 when it declined a modest 1.7%. DJIA’s best pre-election year December was in 1991, up 9.5%.

&gt; Trading in December is holiday inspired and fueled by a buying bias throughout the month. However, the first part of the month tends to be weaker as tax-loss selling and yearend portfolio restructuring begins. Regardless, December is laden with market seasonality and important events.

# Russell 2000 Q4 Best 20 Days

&gt; We have been tracking seasonal market behavior for over five decades and have highlighted fourth quarter strength, holiday trading patterns and monthly trading patterns among other seasonal trading strategies for years.

&gt; There has been a little twitter chatter of late about the old Russell 2000 4th Quarter Best 20 Days Strategy. Lore has is that the Best 20 Days of the 4th quarter for the Russell 2000 are the last two trading days of October, the first two of November, the last seven of November and the last nine of December.

&gt; For perspective I have compare the Russell 2000 to the S&amp;P 500 over these 20 “Best” Days. Russell 2000 does beat the S&amp;P 500 with a cumulative median gain over these 20 days since 1979 of 4.6% and an impressive record of up 38 of the last 40 years, while the S&amp;P 500 delivered a respectable median gain of 3.1%, up 37 of the last 40 years.

# Don’t Fear Record Highs

&gt; “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” – Warren Buffett

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Index has trended higher in an unusually persistent fashion recently. The benchmark has notched 10 record-high closes over the past four weeks, including four straight through November 18.

&gt; It’s human nature to get nervous when market conditions are too calm, especially with an uncertain outlook and an aging bull market. However, we urge investors not to lose sight of their goals.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 has consistently powered past record highs. Since 1950, the benchmark.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/average-return-after-high_1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Stocks rarely move higher in a straight line, though. Since 1950, the S&amp;P 500 has declined an average of 2% in the month after a record-high close. In 2018, the S&amp;P 500 notched a record high September 20, only to fall nearly 20% by December 24. Volatility can be uncomfortable, and it can be difficult to stay focused on long-term prospects when prices are falling.

&gt; Luckily, history shows that even the swiftest sell-offs don’t last forever. After the S&amp;P 500’s nearly 20% slide in late 2018, it recouped all of its losses in the next four months. In 2011, the index dropped 19% from April to October before reaching new highs again in March 2012. The S&amp;P 500 even found its way back to record highs after the 2008–09 financial crisis, nearly 5.5 years after its 2007 October peak.

&gt; “Even though the path can be rocky, stocks have historically offered long-term opportunity for investors,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “It’s important to stick to your investing plan in times of volatility and calm. We still view volatility as an opportunity for suitable long-term investors consider rebalancing portfolios or add to positions.”

# STrump vs. the Average Presidential Election Cycle

&gt; With year three of the current four-year Presidential Election Cycle coming to an end in six weeks, below is an updated look at the average performance of the S&amp;P 500 in each year of the cycle going back to 1928. As shown, years one and two have historically been weaker than years three and four of the cycle. The S&amp;P has been up 56.5% of the time in both year one and year two, but the index has been up 81.8% of the time in year three and 72.7% of the time in year four. Year three has been by far the best year of the cycle with an average gain of 12.81%, and the playbook has stuck to the script in year three of the current cycle with the S&amp;P up 24.5% year-to-date. While year four has historically been consistently positive with gains 72.7% of the time, the average change for the S&amp;P in year four (+5.71%) is just barely better than the average change in years one and two.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/trump-vs-cycle-table.png))**

&gt; Below we show the S&amp;P 500 under Trump so far versus a composite of the S&amp;P four-year Presidential cycle. The S&amp;P gained 19.4% in year one of the current cycle versus an average year-one gain of 5.7%. Year two is historically the worst year of the cycle with an average gain of just 4.54%, and in Trump's second year, the S&amp;P actually fell 6.2%. So far this year, the S&amp;P is up 24.5% versus the average gain of 12.8% during year three of the cycle. As shown in the chart, year four generally trends positively but experiences pullbacks shortly after Q1 and again in October leading up the Election Day before closing out the year strong.

# Which of These Sectors is Not Like the Other

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 is right at all-time highs, but if you look at your portfolio or a random list of stocks, with some of the winners there are bound to be some clunkers. Before getting too restless, though, it's important to keep in mind that not all stocks rally or decline in unison with each other. The chart below perfectly illustrates this. In it, we show the average distance that stocks in the S&amp;P 1500 are trading with respect to their 52-week highs. For the S&amp;P 1500 as a whole, stocks in the index are collectively trading an average of 16.2% from their respective 52-week highs. Large-cap stocks in the S&amp;P 500 are the closest to 52-week highs at just a hair above 10%. Mid Caps are down an average of 14.8% while small caps have been the big laggard with stocks in the S&amp;P 600 down an average of 22.2% from their 52-week highs.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/111819-Distance-from-52-Week-Highs.png))**

&gt; Small-cap stocks have been a laggard for the last year, and one of the key drivers of that weakness has been the Energy sector. The chart below shows how far stocks in the S&amp;P 1500 are trading relative to their 52-week highs broken out by sector. It's not often that you see one sector as such a big outlier relative to all the others, but the Energy sector is in a league of its own these days. Stocks in the sector are more depressed than any other, trading down an average of 42.8% from their 52-week highs. Behind Energy, the next closest sector is Communication Services at an average of 22.7%. That's a spread of more than 20 percentage points between the two sectors with stocks furthest below their 52-week highs!

&gt; While stocks in the Energy and Communication Services sectors are the furthest below their 52-week highs, sectors that are the closest include Utilities and Financials where the average stock in each sector is down less than 10% from their 52-week highs.

# What Does the Market Know About the Consumer That We Don't?

&gt; In just about any economic discussion you read or listen to these days, there's one recurring theme- the strong consumer is picking up the slack. Strong consumer sentiment and generational lows in the unemployment rate are just two of many examples. A search of the term ""strong consumer"" on Google Trends also illustrates the strength of the consumer. While there's still another nine days left in the month, searches for the term ""strong consumer"" in November are on pace to be the highest in at least a year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/112119-Strong-Consumer.png))**

&gt; So, we all agree that the consumer is strong. Right? Well, recently the market begs to differ. The chart below shows the relative strength of the S&amp;P 500 Consumer Discretionary sector versus the S&amp;P 500 over the last year. When the line is rising, it indicates that the Consumer Discretionary sector is outperforming the S&amp;P 500. However, when the line is falling it indicates that the Consumer Discretionary sector is underperforming, and underperforming is what the sector is doing now...in a big way. Even as the S&amp;P 500 is up around 4% in the last month, the Consumer Discretionary sector is down 1%. While many traditional brick and mortar retailers that have fallen on hard times are in the sector because these stocks are already down so much, their weighting in the index has become very small. Meanwhile, stocks that have previously been big winners like Amazon.com (AMZN), Home Depot (HD), and McDonald's (MCD) are the sector's largest components. Does the market know something we don't?

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 25th, 2019.

# **Markets may get a boost from cheery Black Friday consumer sentiment, seasonal strength  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/22/markets-may-get-a-boost-from-cheery-black-friday-consumer-sentiment-seasonal-strength.html)**
*****
&gt; It’s Thanksgiving time, and investors’ thoughts turn to holiday shopping and a year end Santa rally in the stock market.
*****
&gt; Some analysts think both could be pretty good this year.
*****
&gt; While Black Friday has probably lost some of its claim as the launch of holiday shopping, the Friday after Thanksgiving could provide an early glimpse of how much the consumer will spend this year. The National Retail Federation estimates sales should grow by about 4% in the holiday shopping season, enough to keep the economy rolling along.
*****
&gt; JP Morgan analysts, in a note Friday, said they expect sales to be up 4.9% during the holidays, much stronger than last year, when sales gained just 1.9% and shoppers were discouraged by a major sell off in the stock market.
*****
&gt; As for the stock market, it continues to reach for new highs, and some analysts say that shouldn’t change as the calendar progresses deeper into a seasonally strong time of year for stocks.
*****
&gt; “I actually like adding to equities through the rest of the year,” said Cayman Wills, global head of equities at J.P. Morgan Private Bank.
*****
&gt; Wills said she is looking for a better economy, with now no concern about a recession next year. As a result, she began adding to industrials in September and now expects manufacturing data to turn around, supporting her view. She said, if ISM manufacturing data improves Dec. 2, as she expects, industrial company stocks should go even higher.
*****
&gt; The coming week is often a slow one, with markets closed Thursday for Thanksgiving and stock exchanges closing down early on Friday. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell speaks Monday night on the economy, and there are some economic reports worth watching, including durable goods and personal income and spending Wednesday.
*****
&gt; A few final earnings reports are also expected, including Best Buy, HP, and Dell.
*****
&gt; In the bond market, the Treasury auctions $113 billion in 2-year, 5-year and 7-year notes Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.
*****
&gt; Investors are also watching impeachment proceedings in the House, but analysts do not expect the potential impeachment of President Donald Trump to affect markets, since there is little chance he would be convicted by the Republican majority in the Senate.
*****
&gt; Developments on trade talks between the U.S. and China, are by far the most important event for markets.
*****
&gt; “It’s a call on trade in our view. You can’t really predict what Xi and Trump will do,” said Michael Schumacher, director rates, at Wells Fargo. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.75% Friday, from a high of 1.95% on Nov. 12. Rates have moved lower as concerns have increased that the U.S. and China will fail to reach a deal by Dec. 15, heading off a new round of tariffs expected to take effect that day.
*****
&gt; But stocks have not reacted as much to disappointing trade headlines, and are instead looking forward to a new round of talks between U.S. and Chinese officials. The S&amp;P 500 was roughly half percent away from its all time high Friday.
*****
&gt; “Trade is the nugget that helped lead the market higher,” Wills said. “In August we were trading at 16 times [earnings], now we’re at 17.8 times. If the market took out the benefit we saw from trade, it would probably be about 8% lower. That’s not our base case.”
*****
&gt; She expects to see some form of a phase one trade deal, and investors will continue to monitor every headline and tweet about trade talks. U.S. trade negotiators were invited to China to take part in a new round of face-to-face talks, according to the Wall Street Journal. On Friday, Trump said a deal was close.
*****
&gt; “I think there will be continued positive momentum,” said Wills, adding that incumbent presidents know a good economy is important in an election year.
*****
&gt; # Stocks could ‘turkey trot’ higher
&gt; The week around Thanksgiving is often positive for stocks. “If we were using history as a guide, that means we could see the final leg of this turkey trot in the week of Thanksgiving where we end [higher], then spend the next week or so digesting the recent gain,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.
*****
&gt; Stovall said there likely will be a Santa rally this year, but the market typically dips in the middle of December before moving higher. “December is the best month [for the S&amp;P 500]. On average, it’s up 1.6% and also has risen 76% of the time since World War II. It’s the highest price change and the best frequency for an up move of any month,” said Stovall.
*****
&gt; Scott Redler of T3Live. com said it’s very likely there will be a Santa rally taking the market higher into the end of December. “A lot of analysts have a target of 3,200 for this year, but we were a little ahead of ourselves. A week of digestion is welcome. Traders are looking to make sure the market holds 3,070 to 3,090 to give more confidence that the Santa rally could bring it to 3,200 by year end. The question is can the market hold these levels,” Redler said.
*****
&gt; The 3,090 level is the low from this past week, and the 21-day moving average, a momentum indicator, is at 3,075.
*****
&gt; “This week stocks took a little bit of a breather. Next week has a better chance of being seasonally strong,” he said. “This week was more of a breather than a break that could have happened on trade talks.”
*****
&gt; Retail will dominate in the week ahead, as markets watch the final group of store chains report earnings. Dollar Tree, Dick’s Sporting Goods and Best Buy report on Tuesday.
*****
&gt; Target in the past week gave positive indications for the holiday shopping season, as did Walmart the week before. But Home Depot lowered its sales forecast when it reported earnings, and Macy’s slashed its outlook..
*****
&gt; “There are six fewer days between Thanksgiving and Christmas but CFRA does not see this weighing on sales,” said Stovall. “Our analysts expect the tight time frame between Thanksgiving and Christmas will be a boon for retailers which have “buy-online-pickup-in-stores” capabilities.”
*****
&gt; Retail sales are important since the consumer drives more than two-thirds of the economy.
*****
&gt; “The peak of the season includes 27 days between Thanksgiving and Christmas compared to 33 days last year, which is the shortest since 2013. Notably, with Cyber Week and online penetration growing, this is less a risk than the days of yore while the shorter season will likely lessen the depth of the slowdown in early December,” the JP Morgan retail analysts wrote.

# Big Year-to-Date Gains Through November Bode Well for December and 2020

&gt; Going back to 1949 we are on pace for the 10th biggest year-to-date through November gains for the S&amp;P 500 – and it’s a healthy sign for the rest of the year and next. We crunched the numbers for the S&amp;P 500 YTD gains as of the end of November. Average YTD November gains are 7.4%. The list below shows the Top 21 YTD November that are all twice the average, which we felt best represents the current situation.

&gt; Following Decembers and following years have had solid performance and average to slightly better than average results. After big YTD gains December is up 71.4% of the time with an average gain of 1.7% and the next year is up 81.0% of the time with an average gain of 9.9%. The reinforces our positive outlook for the rest of 2019 and 2020.

# Average Performance Nearly Doubles in Pre-Election Year Decembers

&gt; December is now the number two S&amp;P 500 month and the third best month on the Dow Jones Industrials since 1950, averaging gains of 1.5% on each index. It’s the top Russell 2000 (1979) month and third best for NASDAQ (1971) and Russell 1000 (1979). Last year DJIA suffered its worst December performance since 1931 and its fourth worst December going all the way back to 1901. However, the market rarely falls precipitously in December and a repeat of last year is not that likely. When it does it is usually a turning point in the market—near a top or bottom. If the market has experienced fantastic gains leading up to December, stocks can pullback in the first half.

&gt; In pre-election years, December’s overall ranking remains about the same across the board however, average gains improve handsomely. DJIA averages 2.7%, S&amp;P 500 2.9%, NASDAQ 4.3%, Russell 1000 2.9% and Russell 2000 3.1%. DJIA has advanced in 13 of the last 17 pre-election year Decembers. DJIA’s worst pre-election December was in 2015 when it declined a modest 1.7%. DJIA’s best pre-election year December was in 1991, up 9.5%.

&gt; Trading in December is holiday inspired and fueled by a buying bias throughout the month. However, the first part of the month tends to be weaker as tax-loss selling and yearend portfolio restructuring begins. Regardless, December is laden with market seasonality and important events.

# Russell 2000 Q4 Best 20 Days

&gt; We have been tracking seasonal market behavior for over five decades and have highlighted fourth quarter strength, holiday trading patterns and monthly trading patterns among other seasonal trading strategies for years.

&gt; There has been a little twitter chatter of late about the old Russell 2000 4th Quarter Best 20 Days Strategy. Lore has is that the Best 20 Days of the 4th quarter for the Russell 2000 are the last two trading days of October, the first two of November, the last seven of November and the last nine of December.

&gt; For perspective I have compare the Russell 2000 to the S&amp;P 500 over these 20 “Best” Days. Russell 2000 does beat the S&amp;P 500 with a cumulative median gain over these 20 days since 1979 of 4.6% and an impressive record of up 38 of the last 40 years, while the S&amp;P 500 delivered a respectable median gain of 3.1%, up 37 of the last 40 years.

# Don’t Fear Record Highs

&gt; “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” – Warren Buffett

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Index has trended higher in an unusually persistent fashion recently. The benchmark has notched 10 record-high closes over the past four weeks, including four straight through November 18.

&gt; It’s human nature to get nervous when market conditions are too calm, especially with an uncertain outlook and an aging bull market. However, we urge investors not to lose sight of their goals.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 has consistently powered past record highs. Since 1950, the benchmark.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/average-return-after-high_1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Stocks rarely move higher in a straight line, though. Since 1950, the S&amp;P 500 has declined an average of 2% in the month after a record-high close. In 2018, the S&amp;P 500 notched a record high September 20, only to fall nearly 20% by December 24. Volatility can be uncomfortable, and it can be difficult to stay focused on long-term prospects when prices are falling.

&gt; Luckily, history shows that even the swiftest sell-offs don’t last forever. After the S&amp;P 500’s nearly 20% slide in late 2018, it recouped all of its losses in the next four months. In 2011, the index dropped 19% from April to October before reaching new highs again in March 2012. The S&amp;P 500 even found its way back to record highs after the 2008–09 financial crisis, nearly 5.5 years after its 2007 October peak.

&gt; “Even though the path can be rocky, stocks have historically offered long-term opportunity for investors,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “It’s important to stick to your investing plan in times of volatility and calm. We still view volatility as an opportunity for suitable long-term investors consider rebalancing portfolios or add to positions.”

# STrump vs. the Average Presidential Election Cycle

&gt; With year three of the current four-year Presidential Election Cycle coming to an end in six weeks, below is an updated look at the average performance of the S&amp;P 500 in each year of the cycle going back to 1928. As shown, years one and two have historically been weaker than years three and four of the cycle. The S&amp;P has been up 56.5% of the time in both year one and year two, but the index has been up 81.8% of the time in year three and 72.7% of the time in year four. Year three has been by far the best year of the cycle with an average gain of 12.81%, and the playbook has stuck to the script in year three of the current cycle with the S&amp;P up 24.5% year-to-date. While year four has historically been consistently positive with gains 72.7% of the time, the average change for the S&amp;P in year four (+5.71%) is just barely better than the average change in years one and two.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/trump-vs-cycle-table.png))**

&gt; Below we show the S&amp;P 500 under Trump so far versus a composite of the S&amp;P four-year Presidential cycle. The S&amp;P gained 19.4% in year one of the current cycle versus an average year-one gain of 5.7%. Year two is historically the worst year of the cycle with an average gain of just 4.54%, and in Trump's second year, the S&amp;P actually fell 6.2%. So far this year, the S&amp;P is up 24.5% versus the average gain of 12.8% during year three of the cycle. As shown in the chart, year four generally trends positively but experiences pullbacks shortly after Q1 and again in October leading up the Election Day before closing out the year strong.

# Which of These Sectors is Not Like the Other

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 is right at all-time highs, but if you look at your portfolio or a random list of stocks, with some of the winners there are bound to be some clunkers. Before getting too restless, though, it's important to keep in mind that not all stocks rally or decline in unison with each other. The chart below perfectly illustrates this. In it, we show the average distance that stocks in the S&amp;P 1500 are trading with respect to their 52-week highs. For the S&amp;P 1500 as a whole, stocks in the index are collectively trading an average of 16.2% from their respective 52-week highs. Large-cap stocks in the S&amp;P 500 are the closest to 52-week highs at just a hair above 10%. Mid Caps are down an average of 14.8% while small caps have been the big laggard with stocks in the S&amp;P 600 down an average of 22.2% from their 52-week highs.

&gt; Small-cap stocks have been a laggard for the last year, and one of the key drivers of that weakness has been the Energy sector. The chart below shows how far stocks in the S&amp;P 1500 are trading relative to their 52-week highs broken out by sector. It's not often that you see one sector as such a big outlier relative to all the others, but the Energy sector is in a league of its own these days. Stocks in the sector are more depressed than any other, trading down an average of 42.8% from their 52-week highs. Behind Energy, the next closest sector is Communication Services at an average of 22.7%. That's a spread of more than 20 percentage points between the two sectors with stocks furthest below their 52-week highs!

&gt; While stocks in the Energy and Communication Services sectors are the furthest below their 52-week highs, sectors that are the closest include Utilities and Financials where the average stock in each sector is down less than 10% from their 52-week highs.

# What Does the Market Know About the Consumer That We Don't?

&gt; In just about any economic discussion you read or listen to these days, there's one recurring theme- the strong consumer is picking up the slack. Strong consumer sentiment and generational lows in the unemployment rate are just two of many examples. A search of the term ""strong consumer"" on Google Trends also illustrates the strength of the consumer. While there's still another nine days left in the month, searches for the term ""strong consumer"" in November are on pace to be the highest in at least a year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/112119-Strong-Consumer.png))**

&gt; So, we all agree that the consumer is strong. Right? Well, recently the market begs to differ. The chart below shows the relative strength of the S&amp;P 500 Consumer Discretionary sector versus the S&amp;P 500 over the last year. When the line is rising, it indicates that the Consumer Discretionary sector is outperforming the S&amp;P 500. However, when the line is falling it indicates that the Consumer Discretionary sector is underperforming, and underperforming is what the sector is doing now...in a big way. Even as the S&amp;P 500 is up around 4% in the last month, the Consumer Discretionary sector is down 1%. While many traditional brick and mortar retailers that have fallen on hard times are in the sector because these stocks are already down so much, their weighting in the index has become very small. Meanwhile, stocks that have previously been big winners like Amazon.com (AMZN), Home Depot (HD), and McDonald's (MCD) are the sector's largest components. Does the market know something we don't?

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 25th, 2019.

# **Markets may get a boost from cheery Black Friday consumer sentiment, seasonal strength  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/22/markets-may-get-a-boost-from-cheery-black-friday-consumer-sentiment-seasonal-strength.html)**
*****
&gt; It’s Thanksgiving time, and investors’ thoughts turn to holiday shopping and a year end Santa rally in the stock market.
*****
&gt; Some analysts think both could be pretty good this year.
*****
&gt; While Black Friday has probably lost some of its claim as the launch of holiday shopping, the Friday after Thanksgiving could provide an early glimpse of how much the consumer will spend this year. The National Retail Federation estimates sales should grow by about 4% in the holiday shopping season, enough to keep the economy rolling along.
*****
&gt; JP Morgan analysts, in a note Friday, said they expect sales to be up 4.9% during the holidays, much stronger than last year, when sales gained just 1.9% and shoppers were discouraged by a major sell off in the stock market.
*****
&gt; As for the stock market, it continues to reach for new highs, and some analysts say that shouldn’t change as the calendar progresses deeper into a seasonally strong time of year for stocks.
*****
&gt; “I actually like adding to equities through the rest of the year,” said Cayman Wills, global head of equities at J.P. Morgan Private Bank.
*****
&gt; Wills said she is looking for a better economy, with now no concern about a recession next year. As a result, she began adding to industrials in September and now expects manufacturing data to turn around, supporting her view. She said, if ISM manufacturing data improves Dec. 2, as she expects, industrial company stocks should go even higher.
*****
&gt; The coming week is often a slow one, with markets closed Thursday for Thanksgiving and stock exchanges closing down early on Friday. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell speaks Monday night on the economy, and there are some economic reports worth watching, including durable goods and personal income and spending Wednesday.
*****
&gt; A few final earnings reports are also expected, including Best Buy, HP, and Dell.
*****
&gt; In the bond market, the Treasury auctions $113 billion in 2-year, 5-year and 7-year notes Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.
*****
&gt; Investors are also watching impeachment proceedings in the House, but analysts do not expect the potential impeachment of President Donald Trump to affect markets, since there is little chance he would be convicted by the Republican majority in the Senate.
*****
&gt; Developments on trade talks between the U.S. and China, are by far the most important event for markets.
*****
&gt; “It’s a call on trade in our view. You can’t really predict what Xi and Trump will do,” said Michael Schumacher, director rates, at Wells Fargo. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.75% Friday, from a high of 1.95% on Nov. 12. Rates have moved lower as concerns have increased that the U.S. and China will fail to reach a deal by Dec. 15, heading off a new round of tariffs expected to take effect that day.
*****
&gt; But stocks have not reacted as much to disappointing trade headlines, and are instead looking forward to a new round of talks between U.S. and Chinese officials. The S&amp;P 500 was roughly half percent away from its all time high Friday.
*****
&gt; “Trade is the nugget that helped lead the market higher,” Wills said. “In August we were trading at 16 times [earnings], now we’re at 17.8 times. If the market took out the benefit we saw from trade, it would probably be about 8% lower. That’s not our base case.”
*****
&gt; She expects to see some form of a phase one trade deal, and investors will continue to monitor every headline and tweet about trade talks. U.S. trade negotiators were invited to China to take part in a new round of face-to-face talks, according to the Wall Street Journal. On Friday, Trump said a deal was close.
*****
&gt; “I think there will be continued positive momentum,” said Wills, adding that incumbent presidents know a good economy is important in an election year.
*****
&gt; # Stocks could ‘turkey trot’ higher
&gt; The week around Thanksgiving is often positive for stocks. “If we were using history as a guide, that means we could see the final leg of this turkey trot in the week of Thanksgiving where we end [higher], then spend the next week or so digesting the recent gain,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.
*****
&gt; Stovall said there likely will be a Santa rally this year, but the market typically dips in the middle of December before moving higher. “December is the best month [for the S&amp;P 500]. On average, it’s up 1.6% and also has risen 76% of the time since World War II. It’s the highest price change and the best frequency for an up move of any month,” said Stovall.
*****
&gt; Scott Redler of T3Live. com said it’s very likely there will be a Santa rally taking the market higher into the end of December. “A lot of analysts have a target of 3,200 for this year, but we were a little ahead of ourselves. A week of digestion is welcome. Traders are looking to make sure the market holds 3,070 to 3,090 to give more confidence that the Santa rally could bring it to 3,200 by year end. The question is can the market hold these levels,” Redler said.
*****
&gt; The 3,090 level is the low from this past week, and the 21-day moving average, a momentum indicator, is at 3,075.
*****
&gt; “This week stocks took a little bit of a breather. Next week has a better chance of being seasonally strong,” he said. “This week was more of a breather than a break that could have happened on trade talks.”
*****
&gt; Retail will dominate in the week ahead, as markets watch the final group of store chains report earnings. Dollar Tree, Dick’s Sporting Goods and Best Buy report on Tuesday.
*****
&gt; Target in the past week gave positive indications for the holiday shopping season, as did Walmart the week before. But Home Depot lowered its sales forecast when it reported earnings, and Macy’s slashed its outlook..
*****
&gt; “There are six fewer days between Thanksgiving and Christmas but CFRA does not see this weighing on sales,” said Stovall. “Our analysts expect the tight time frame between Thanksgiving and Christmas will be a boon for retailers which have “buy-online-pickup-in-stores” capabilities.”
*****
&gt; Retail sales are important since the consumer drives more than two-thirds of the economy.
*****
&gt; “The peak of the season includes 27 days between Thanksgiving and Christmas compared to 33 days last year, which is the shortest since 2013. Notably, with Cyber Week and online penetration growing, this is less a risk than the days of yore while the shorter season will likely lessen the depth of the slowdown in early December,” the JP Morgan retail analysts wrote.

# Big Year-to-Date Gains Through November Bode Well for December and 2020

&gt; Going back to 1949 we are on pace for the 10th biggest year-to-date through November gains for the S&amp;P 500 – and it’s a healthy sign for the rest of the year and next. We crunched the numbers for the S&amp;P 500 YTD gains as of the end of November. Average YTD November gains are 7.4%. The list below shows the Top 21 YTD November that are all twice the average, which we felt best represents the current situation.

&gt; Following Decembers and following years have had solid performance and average to slightly better than average results. After big YTD gains December is up 71.4% of the time with an average gain of 1.7% and the next year is up 81.0% of the time with an average gain of 9.9%. The reinforces our positive outlook for the rest of 2019 and 2020.

# Average Performance Nearly Doubles in Pre-Election Year Decembers

&gt; December is now the number two S&amp;P 500 month and the third best month on the Dow Jones Industrials since 1950, averaging gains of 1.5% on each index. It’s the top Russell 2000 (1979) month and third best for NASDAQ (1971) and Russell 1000 (1979). Last year DJIA suffered its worst December performance since 1931 and its fourth worst December going all the way back to 1901. However, the market rarely falls precipitously in December and a repeat of last year is not that likely. When it does it is usually a turning point in the market—near a top or bottom. If the market has experienced fantastic gains leading up to December, stocks can pullback in the first half.

&gt; In pre-election years, December’s overall ranking remains about the same across the board however, average gains improve handsomely. DJIA averages 2.7%, S&amp;P 500 2.9%, NASDAQ 4.3%, Russell 1000 2.9% and Russell 2000 3.1%. DJIA has advanced in 13 of the last 17 pre-election year Decembers. DJIA’s worst pre-election December was in 2015 when it declined a modest 1.7%. DJIA’s best pre-election year December was in 1991, up 9.5%.

&gt; Trading in December is holiday inspired and fueled by a buying bias throughout the month. However, the first part of the month tends to be weaker as tax-loss selling and yearend portfolio restructuring begins. Regardless, December is laden with market seasonality and important events.

# Russell 2000 Q4 Best 20 Days

&gt; We have been tracking seasonal market behavior for over five decades and have highlighted fourth quarter strength, holiday trading patterns and monthly trading patterns among other seasonal trading strategies for years.

&gt; There has been a little twitter chatter of late about the old Russell 2000 4th Quarter Best 20 Days Strategy. Lore has is that the Best 20 Days of the 4th quarter for the Russell 2000 are the last two trading days of October, the first two of November, the last seven of November and the last nine of December.

&gt; For perspective I have compare the Russell 2000 to the S&amp;P 500 over these 20 “Best” Days. Russell 2000 does beat the S&amp;P 500 with a cumulative median gain over these 20 days since 1979 of 4.6% and an impressive record of up 38 of the last 40 years, while the S&amp;P 500 delivered a respectable median gain of 3.1%, up 37 of the last 40 years.

# Don’t Fear Record Highs

&gt; “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” – Warren Buffett

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Index has trended higher in an unusually persistent fashion recently. The benchmark has notched 10 record-high closes over the past four weeks, including four straight through November 18.

&gt; It’s human nature to get nervous when market conditions are too calm, especially with an uncertain outlook and an aging bull market. However, we urge investors not to lose sight of their goals.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 has consistently powered past record highs. Since 1950, the benchmark.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/average-return-after-high_1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Stocks rarely move higher in a straight line, though. Since 1950, the S&amp;P 500 has declined an average of 2% in the month after a record-high close. In 2018, the S&amp;P 500 notched a record high September 20, only to fall nearly 20% by December 24. Volatility can be uncomfortable, and it can be difficult to stay focused on long-term prospects when prices are falling.

&gt; Luckily, history shows that even the swiftest sell-offs don’t last forever. After the S&amp;P 500’s nearly 20% slide in late 2018, it recouped all of its losses in the next four months. In 2011, the index dropped 19% from April to October before reaching new highs again in March 2012. The S&amp;P 500 even found its way back to record highs after the 2008–09 financial crisis, nearly 5.5 years after its 2007 October peak.

&gt; “Even though the path can be rocky, stocks have historically offered long-term opportunity for investors,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “It’s important to stick to your investing plan in times of volatility and calm. We still view volatility as an opportunity for suitable long-term investors consider rebalancing portfolios or add to positions.”

# STrump vs. the Average Presidential Election Cycle

&gt; With year three of the current four-year Presidential Election Cycle coming to an end in six weeks, below is an updated look at the average performance of the S&amp;P 500 in each year of the cycle going back to 1928. As shown, years one and two have historically been weaker than years three and four of the cycle. The S&amp;P has been up 56.5% of the time in both year one and year two, but the index has been up 81.8% of the time in year three and 72.7% of the time in year four. Year three has been by far the best year of the cycle with an average gain of 12.81%, and the playbook has stuck to the script in year three of the current cycle with the S&amp;P up 24.5% year-to-date. While year four has historically been consistently positive with gains 72.7% of the time, the average change for the S&amp;P in year four (+5.71%) is just barely better than the average change in years one and two.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/trump-vs-cycle-table.png))**

&gt; Below we show the S&amp;P 500 under Trump so far versus a composite of the S&amp;P four-year Presidential cycle. The S&amp;P gained 19.4% in year one of the current cycle versus an average year-one gain of 5.7%. Year two is historically the worst year of the cycle with an average gain of just 4.54%, and in Trump's second year, the S&amp;P actually fell 6.2%. So far this year, the S&amp;P is up 24.5% versus the average gain of 12.8% during year three of the cycle. As shown in the chart, year four generally trends positively but experiences pullbacks shortly after Q1 and again in October leading up the Election Day before closing out the year strong.

# Which of These Sectors is Not Like the Other

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 is right at all-time highs, but if you look at your portfolio or a random list of stocks, with some of the winners there are bound to be some clunkers. Before getting too restless, though, it's important to keep in mind that not all stocks rally or decline in unison with each other. The chart below perfectly illustrates this. In it, we show the average distance that stocks in the S&amp;P 1500 are trading with respect to their 52-week highs. For the S&amp;P 1500 as a whole, stocks in the index are collectively trading an average of 16.2% from their respective 52-week highs. Large-cap stocks in the S&amp;P 500 are the closest to 52-week highs at just a hair above 10%. Mid Caps are down an average of 14.8% while small caps have been the big laggard with stocks in the S&amp;P 600 down an average of 22.2% from their 52-week highs.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/111819-Distance-from-52-Week-Highs.png))**

&gt; Small-cap stocks have been a laggard for the last year, and one of the key drivers of that weakness has been the Energy sector. The chart below shows how far stocks in the S&amp;P 1500 are trading relative to their 52-week highs broken out by sector. It's not often that you see one sector as such a big outlier relative to all the others, but the Energy sector is in a league of its own these days. Stocks in the sector are more depressed than any other, trading down an average of 42.8% from their 52-week highs. Behind Energy, the next closest sector is Communication Services at an average of 22.7%. That's a spread of more than 20 percentage points between the two sectors with stocks furthest below their 52-week highs!

&gt; While stocks in the Energy and Communication Services sectors are the furthest below their 52-week highs, sectors that are the closest include Utilities and Financials where the average stock in each sector is down less than 10% from their 52-week highs.

# What Does the Market Know About the Consumer That We Don't?

&gt; In just about any economic discussion you read or listen to these days, there's one recurring theme- the strong consumer is picking up the slack. Strong consumer sentiment and generational lows in the unemployment rate are just two of many examples. A search of the term ""strong consumer"" on Google Trends also illustrates the strength of the consumer. While there's still another nine days left in the month, searches for the term ""strong consumer"" in November are on pace to be the highest in at least a year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/112119-Strong-Consumer.png))**

&gt; So, we all agree that the consumer is strong. Right? Well, recently the market begs to differ. The chart below shows the relative strength of the S&amp;P 500 Consumer Discretionary sector versus the S&amp;P 500 over the last year. When the line is rising, it indicates that the Consumer Discretionary sector is outperforming the S&amp;P 500. However, when the line is falling it indicates that the Consumer Discretionary sector is underperforming, and underperforming is what the sector is doing now...in a big way. Even as the S&amp;P 500 is up around 4% in the last month, the Consumer Discretionary sector is down 1%. While many traditional brick and mortar retailers that have fallen on hard times are in the sector because these stocks are already down so much, their weighting in the index has become very small. Meanwhile, stocks that have previously been big winners like Amazon.com (AMZN), Home Depot (HD), and McDonald's (MCD) are the sector's largest components. Does the market know something we don't?

This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good

&amp;#x200B;

I have been researching investing in property and have been researching the Roundrock, Texas area. I'm targeting a 250K property and renting out 2-3 rooms. I should have no problem making the downpayment and finding a property management company. 

I was wondering if anyone out their has advice on how to evaluate how good an area is for investing in property? Roundrock is close to Austin as is the headquarters to Dell. It seems like the schools and crime rate are favorable. Any heuristic and tips are appreciated!

114,DELL,Significant Activist Hedge Fund Activity (Last 7 Days),"These are the latest Schedule 13D forms filed by activist investors in the last 7 days. Activist
investors are investors that make an investment with the intention of influencing management in some way.
There is evidence that following activist investors into investments can generate excess returns.
Schedule 13G forms, in contrast, are filed by significant investors with no intention of influencing management
(such as Index funds).

There is always a lot of interest in insider trades, but what a lot of people probably don't realize
is that hedge fund activity is probably more predictive of future returns than insider activity.
The reason is that hedge funds (a) have large research budgets, and (b) have a choice where to put their money.
In contract, insiders have no choice where to put their money, but only when to time their transactions.

## New Filings
This table lists new 13D filings in the last week. A new filing does not necessarily indicate a new position,
as investors frequently accumulate in advance before reaching the filing threshold.

143,DELL,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning August 26th, 2019","Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 26th, 2019.

# **Week ahead: Stocks could be rocky on trade, economy fears, as August breaks low volatility streak - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/23/week-ahead-stocks-could-be-rocky-on-trade-economy.html)**
*****
&gt; The final week of August — the bittersweet end of summer for many— could be highly volatile, as markets fret over the economy and the latest developments in trade wars.
*****
&gt; President Donald Trump joins the G-7 leaders in France over the weekend, and markets will be watching to see if the meeting exposes new fault lines in the shaky relations among a once fairly congenial leadership group that fought the Great Recession together. Trump is expected to discuss the U.S. economy and highlight the U.S. pro-jobs, pro-growth agenda, under his leadership.
*****
&gt; The U.S. trade war with China escalated sharply in the past week, with a new round of tariffs from China on U.S. goods announced Friday and new threats from Trump, who “ordered” American companies to find alternatives to China. That immediately triggered speculation that the trade war will be extended and more contentious, and the U.S. economy risks falling into recession.
*****
&gt; After the close Friday, Trump retaliated against China’s tariffs by raising existing tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese goods to 30% from 25%, as of Oct. 1. In a tweet, he also said he was raising new tariffs on $300 billion in Chinese goods that have not yet gone into effect to 15% from 10%.
*****
&gt; Friday’s trading was volatile, and stocks fell by about 2.5%, erasing what would have been a second positive week for the market. Treasury yields, which move opposite price, continued to go lower amid worries about the economy and fears the Fed will not act aggressively enough to head off a recession.
*****
&gt; Stocks have been volatile, and the S&amp;P 500 is down about 4.5% in the month of August.
*****
&gt; Michael Arone, State Street Advisors chief investment strategist said the first seven months of the year were more certain for investors in terms of their expectations for Fed rate cuts and a possible trade deal. But the trade tensions have worsened, and the trade war could escalate even further.
*****
&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell spoke at Jackson Hole Friday morning, but while he left the door open for rate cuts, he did not explicitly promise rate cuts.
*****
&gt; “The Fed has become a lot less certain. Until we get more clarity, you’re likely to see this volatility, and stocks will trade sideways,” Arone said. Even though corporate earnings weakened, “investors took a big leap of faith in the first seven months of the year, expecting both a trade deal and monetary policy easing.”
*****
&gt; The escalation of the trade war makes a deal unlikely anytime soon. This, however, did drive market expectations for rate cuts higher Friday afternoon, and the market was expecting three more cuts this year.
*****
&gt; Trump tied his feuds with China and the Fed together Friday, when he tweeted that the Fed is not helping with easier rate policy, along with a question about “who is the bigger enemy” — China President Xi Jinping or Fed Chairman Jerome Powell.
*****
&gt; “I think the Fed is in uncharted territory, and I continue to have empathy for Chairman Powell. I think markets want faster and more aggressive policy. He’s dealing with challenges the Fed has never had,” said Arone.
*****
&gt; ”[Powell] is literally walking a tight rope. He has the president who is daily bashing him,” he said. “Bond markets are demanding a much greater number of rate cuts, and he’s got geopolitical challenges, whether it’s Brexit or trade. He’s also got dissension among Fed voting members. That’s a lot to balance.”
*****
&gt; There is some important data in the coming week, including durable goods Monday and personal spending and consumption data Friday, which also includes the PCE deflator, the Fed’s preferred inflation indicator.
*****
&gt; “The data will give us some indications on business spending. Durable goods has capital expenditure orders. It looks look consumer confidence will come out [Tuesday] as well,” Arone said. Business spending has been taking a hit from the trade wars, and economists are concerned it will continue to weaken, ultimately leading to weakness in the consumer economy.
*****
&gt; The week ahead could see some swings ahead of the long Labor Day Holiday weekend. “Given high absentees and low volumes, my guess is it’s going to add to volatility,” said Arone.
*****
&gt; Frank Cappelleri, Nomura executive director, said he also expects volatility, and the S&amp;P could test the outer limits of its recent range.
*****
&gt; Of the 17 trading days this month, nine of them saw absolute 1% moves in the S&amp;P 500. The last time that occurred was in December, when there were 10 days with 1% moves, according to Cappelleri. The most in one month was February, 2018 when there were 12. Contrast that to the entire year of 2017, when there were just eight.
*****
&gt; Friday’s action was volatile, and the S&amp;P 500 was down as much as 3%.
*****
&gt; “This is the third-biggest decline we’ve had this month. Each of them started within 10 points of each other, near the top of the range,” said Cappelleri. The top of the range is 2,943, its Aug. 13 high, and the bottom is 2,820, near the Aug. 5 low.
*****
&gt; “We’re obviously still in a trading range that has been characterized by sharp moves and acute turns, so I think when we had that initial drop on Aug. 5, the question is where is it going to stop,” he said, adding traders are watching that Aug. 5 level to see if it will act as a floor.

# Second Half August Trading: Historically Weak Too

&gt; Following three straight days of gains, the market has recovered a sizable portion of its losses from earlier in the month. Losses earlier in the month and gains over the past three days (prior to today) have tracked August’s typical trading pattern for over the last 21-years quite closely. The magnitude of the moves this year has been larger than average, but the pattern has been tracked.

&gt; Due to the magnitude of this year’s moves, August’s performance over the past 21-years has been plotted on the left vertical axis in the chart above and 2019 is plotted on the right. From right around mid-month or now through the end of August, the historical trend has been weaker. DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and 2000 have all averaged a loss in August from 1998 to 2018 and they are on track to repeat this year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/01a116327b794dfbbf5f60981adf7ef1/f81503f55cdacc93-55/s500x750/41c284d8350eac55b6e9a2b768b07a84cbed9936.jpg))**

# Is a Small-Cap Labor Day Rally Coming Soon

&gt; In the below chart, forty years of daily data for the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies are divided by the Russell 1000 index of largest companies, and then compressed into a single year to show an idealized yearly pattern. When the graph is descending, large-cap companies are outperforming small-cap companies; when the graph is rising, smaller companies are moving up faster than their larger brethren. The most prominent period of outperformance generally begins in mid-December and lasts until late-February or early March with a surge in January. This period of outperformance by small-caps is known as the “January Effect” in the annual Stock Trader’s Almanac.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7e6c3b63cadd687e835cca014192dd72/fcd39e87be04620c-93/s500x750/7e0c19f7fee940a61f9ece5a88f65d53900365f3.jpg))**

&gt; In recent years, another sizable move is quite evident just before Labor Day. One possible explanation for this move is individual investors begin to return to work after summertime vacations and are searching for “bargain” stocks. In a typical year, small-caps would have been lagging and could represent an opportunity relative to other large-cap possibilities. As of Friday’s close (August 16, 2019), Russell 2000 is up 10.8% compared to the Russell 1000 being up 15.5% year-to-date. Lagging small-caps and resilient U.S. consumers could be the ideal setup for a repeat of this pattern this year. However, the small-cap advantage does historically wane around mid-September.

# September Almanac: No Respite in Pre-Election Years

&gt; The start of business year, end of summer vacations, and back to school made September a leading barometer month in first 60 years of 20th century, now portfolio managers back after Labor Day tend to clean house Since 1950, September is the worst performing month of the year for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 1000 (since 1979). Sizable gains in September 2012, 2013 and 2017 have lifted Russell 2000 to second worst (since 1979). September was creamed four years straight from 1999-2002 after four solid years from 1995-1998 during the dot.com bubble madness. September gets no respite from positive pre-election year forces.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5e73bc3f171da163b1e601cc26081c21/773b35094e2a77db-2e/s400x600/50353a79845a11b2bdb490f6a5ae95d25a672388.jpg))**

&gt; Although the month used to open strong, S&amp;P 500 has declined eight times in the last eleven years on the first trading day. As tans begin to fade and the new school year begins, fund managers tend to sell underperforming positions as the end of the third quarter approaches, causing some nasty selloffs near month-end over the years. Recent substantial declines occurred following the terrorist attacks in 2001 (DJIA: –11.1%), 2002 (DJIA –12.4%), the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 (DJIA: –6.0%) and U.S. debt ceiling debacle in 2011 (DJIA –6.0%). However, September is improving with S&amp;P 500 advancing in ten of the last 15 Septembers and DJIA climbing in nine.

# Leading Indicators Signal Growth Ahead

&gt; U.S. leading indicators rebounded in July, a good sign for the durability of the expansion.

&gt; The Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index (LEI) rose 0.5% month over month, the biggest gain since September 2018, and above consensus expectations for a 0.3% increase. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, Leading Indicators Slowing But Growing, the LEI climbed 1.6% year over year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DUqIDwl.jpg))**

&gt; The LEI, which we include as one of the “Five Forecasters” of our Recession Watch Dashboard, has yet to turn negative this cycle. The index has fallen negative year over year before all nine recessions since 1955.

&gt; “Some investors have pointed out slowing LEI growth as a reason for caution,” said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “However, the LEI is signaling moderate U.S. economic growth ahead, with no signs of an imminent recession.”

&gt; The LEI is calculated from 10 individual leading data sets, including weekly jobless claims, building permits, and stock prices. This year, the majority of LEI components have boosted month-over-month growth in the index, but more internationally exposed data sets have turned into net drags.

&gt; In July, 6 of 10 components rose month over month, but four components—average hours worked, manufacturers’ new orders, new orders for nondefense capital spending, and interest rate spreads—fell month over month. Historically, breadth in LEI components has deteriorated further before a recession began. In contrast, at the end of each of the past six economic cycles, more than half of the LEI components were in decline.

&gt; While evidence of slowing growth in leading indicators is disappointing, we are encouraged by what we see outside of manufacturing. Global manufacturing has been the sector hardest hit by prolonged trade tensions and weakened demand, and we don’t expect to see much improvement until a U.S.-China trade resolution is reached. Even then, a recovery in manufacturing may take some time.

# Crude Oil's Descending Triangle

&gt; Earlier this week, crude oil was trading well over 2% higher than last Friday's close. Over the past few sessions, though, oil has given up all of those gains. The catalyst for today's declines are the Chinese retaliatory tariffs on US crude which are expected to dampen demand. This week's negative reversal comes as the commodity ran into multiple points of resistance. For starters, the rally began to stall out mid-week when it met the converging 200 and 50-day moving averages. This also coincided with a downtrend that traces itself all the way back to the highs from late last year. In fact, crude is down around 30% from these previous highs.

&gt; Overall, the technical picture for crude oil is not in a great place as the chart is forming a descending triangle pattern. Despite the big gains at the beginning of 2019, over the past few months, crude has been making consistent lower highs and lower lows. Given this most recent failure to retake the moving averages and break out of the downtrend, the next major support level to watch is around $50 which is a level that has held up at multiple times in the past few months. This support also draws back to late last year prior to the collapse in December.

# Yield Curves: Another Record Streak Bites the Dust

&gt; After the 3-month vs 10-year US Treasury yield curve first inverted earlier this year, the market has shifted its focus to the 2-year vs 10-year part of the curve which had yet to reach inverted levels. That was, until yesterday. While the 10s2s curve flirted with inverted territory for the last few days on an intraday basis, Thursday was the first time in more than a decade that the closing yield on the two-year US Treasury was above the yield on the 10-year. And with another closely watched part of the curve moving into inverted levels, recession fears increased.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/082319-10s2s-YC-Long-Terms.png))**

&gt; As the chart above illustrates, it has been a while since the 10s2s curve was inverted. In fact, the streak that just ended was the longest on record going back to 1977, and it wasn't even close. Going back to 1977, there have only been three prior streaks where the 10s2s curve was inverted for more than 1,000 days, and never before had the curve been positively sloped for more than 2,000 days. The current streak, though? 3,054 days. It was fun while it lasted!

# Adapt or Die

&gt; A common characteristic of most investors and traders is to always be on the lookout for patterns and connections between various asset classes. Whenever one correlated asset confirms the move in another it adds a layer of confidence to an investor's thesis. One long-held example is the Dow Transports as a leading or coincident indicator for the broader market. For decades now, many investors have followed the transports for confirmation of the broader market moves. If the transports — which move all of the physical goods in the economy — rally, it suggests that the broader market will be strong, while periods when the transports start to roll over are read as a signal that there's an underlying weakness in the economy.

&gt; As the US economy has become more service and digital-oriented in nature, there has been a valid argument made that the transports have lost some of their importance as an indicator of the broader economy. Along these lines, we have suggested that rather than transports, semiconductors may represent this century's 'transports' as they are a part of just about everything in this digital age. Whether you agree with this or not isn't important, but the important takeaway is that just because two asset classes have been highly correlated in the past doesn't mean that they will remain that way in the future. It's one thing to recognize a correlation between two asset classes, but it's much more important to understand why they are correlated and be on the lookout for factors that may change the status quo in the future.

&gt; One example of a radical change in a relationship between two asset classes is the interaction between the relative strength of growth and value stocks versus the slope of the yield curve. From 2002 through 2011, the two were closely correlated. As the curve flattened in the early part of this century, growth stocks underperformed value by a wide margin (falling blue line). Then in mid-2007, as the curve steepened and came out from inverted territory, growth stocks started to rip higher relative to value. Beginning in 2009, though, the curve stopped steepening and the relative strength of growth relative to value stalled out. The two series were so closely joined at the hip during this ten-year stretch that the correlation coefficient between the two was +0.82, which is indicative of two series moving in lockstep with each other.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/082219-YC-GV-2002-2019.png))**

&gt; If the paths of the yield curve and the relative strength of growth versus value couldn't be separated from 2002 through 2011, the relationship soured in 2012 when the two came down with a case of the ten-year itch. At that point, they couldn't separate fast enough. The chart below shows the same two series from the start of 2012 through the present. Now, when one goes up the other goes down and vice versa, as the paths are nearly exact opposites. In fact, in the nearly eight years since 2012, the correlation between the two is -0.90.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/082219-YC-GV-2012-2019.png))**

&gt; In the chart below we have shown the two series over the entire time period spanning 2002 through 2019. The non-shaded area represents the period covered in the first chart, while the shaded area covers the second period. Right around the time where the shaded period starts is when the positive correlation turned on a dime, and beginning in 2013 when the curve started to flatten, investors who were still hanging on to the idea that a flatter yield curve was a green light for value stocks, saw what turned out to be an extended period of misery relative to the performance of growth stocks. In the words of Intel Founder Andy Grove, ""Adapt or Die.""

# Nasdaq 100 to S&amp;P 500 Ratio

&gt; Below is a chart of the Nasdaq 100 going back to 1990. While it took 15+ years for the index to make a new all-time closing high following its March 2000 peak, the index is currently 65% above those March 2000 highs.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ndx100.png))**

&gt; Below is a ratio chart of the Nasdaq 100's price versus the S&amp;P 500's price since 1990. The ratio started well below 1 in early 1990 but quickly overtook the S&amp;P in price by the mid-90s. As you can see, the ratio spiked dramatically above 3 during the peak of the Dot Com bubble in late 1999. The Nasdaq 100 then gave up much of that outperformance versus the S&amp;P 500 over a 2-3 year period where the ratio got all the way back down to 1, but since then it has been steadily trending higher to its current level of 2.65. While it went through a bubble and a burst over a 5-year period, the Nasdaq has been outperforming the S&amp;P 500 for a long time now.

116,DELL,Significant Insider Trading Activity (Last 7 Days),"This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.

41,DELL,Effects of Buybacks on US Economy?,"What likely follow-on consequences will arise from the trend of stock buybacks by companies?

Trends can give rise to other follow-on trends. For instance, lots of sub-prime debt repackaging can result in lots of sub-prime lending, can result in lots of insolvencies later on. It would be useful to see the pro's and cons, and overall follow-on consequences of the recent prevalent trend of stock buybacks.

[https://www.ntu.org/foundation/detail/what-do-stock-buybacks-mean-for-the-economy](https://www.ntu.org/foundation/detail/what-do-stock-buybacks-mean-for-the-economy)

That article basically says stock buybacks are good for stock market valuations, which is good for investors' portfolio valuations. Arguably, those investors would have more money to spend into the economy. Okay, so that's a trickledown effect, but is there any downside?

[https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042015/why-would-company-buyback-its-own-shares.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042015/why-would-company-buyback-its-own-shares.asp)

&gt;Since companies raise [equity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equity.asp) [capital](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital.asp) through the sale of common and [preferred shares](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/preferredstock.asp), it may seem counter-intuitive that a business might choose to give that money back. However, there are numerous reasons why it may be beneficial to a company to repurchase its shares, including ownership [consolidation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consolidation.asp), [undervaluation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/undervalued.asp), and boosting its key financial ratios.

So companies buying back their own equity at terms more favorable to them can potentially regain more control over their own sovereignty and decision-making, by being less under the control of shareholders. Didn't Dell go private in order to gain more control over itself for restructuring purposes?

&gt;Unused Cash Is Costly

So buybacks are a more efficient use of capital - meaning that capital is better off in the hands of companies/sellers than in the hands of shareholders/buyers.

&gt;The Stock Is Undervalued

Who's the best judge of whether a stock is undervalued - the company/share-offerer or the shareholder? Wouldn't shareholders be more objective about a company's valuation?

Isn't there a risk of flaccid companies buying back their stocks to artificially boost or prop up their share price without creating any real value?

Will we see more companies using buybacks to consolidate more control over their equity to embark on radical restructuring, like Dell? Which companies might do this?

Would there be a greater likelihood of companies suffering reduced cash flow, and thus resorting to other means to compensate for that? If so, then by what means?

Can anyone name an example of a company whose stock buyback has significantly impacted their current or future prospects?

[https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1dfj9g9mfnqxb/Share-Buybacks-May-Be-Bad-Just-Not-for-the-Reasons-You-Think](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1dfj9g9mfnqxb/Share-Buybacks-May-Be-Bad-Just-Not-for-the-Reasons-You-Think)",7,6,1563072688.0,2019-07-14T02:51:28+00:00,t3_ccy10w,investing
117,DELL,Significant Activist Hedge Fund Activity (Last 7 Days),"These are the latest Schedule 13D forms filed by activist investors in the last 7 days. Activist
investors are investors that make an investment with the intention of influencing management in some way.
There is evidence that following activist investors into investments can generate excess returns.
Schedule 13G forms, in contrast, are filed by significant investors with no intention of influencing management
(such as Index funds).

There is always a lot of interest in insider trades, but what a lot of people probably don't realize
is that hedge fund activity is probably more predictive of future returns than insider activity.
The reason is that hedge funds (a) have large research budgets, and (b) have a choice where to put their money.
In contract, insiders have no choice where to put their money, but only when to time their transactions.

226,DELL,Significant Activist Hedge Fund Activity (Last 7 Days),"These are the latest Schedule 13D forms filed by activist investors in the last 7 days. Activist
investors are investors that make an investment with the intention of influencing management in some way.
There is evidence that following activist investors into investments can generate excess returns.
Schedule 13G forms, in contrast, are filed by significant investors with no intention of influencing management
(such as Index funds).

There is always a lot of interest in insider trades, but what a lot of people probably don't realize
is that hedge fund activity is probably more predictive of future returns than insider activity.
The reason is that hedge funds (a) have large research budgets, and (b) have a choice where to put their money.
In contract, insiders have no choice where to put their money, but only when to time their transactions.

119,DELL,Significant Activist Hedge Fund Activity (Last 7 Days),"These are the latest Schedule 13D forms filed by activist investors in the last 7 days. Activist
investors are investors that make an investment with the intention of influencing management in some way.
There is evidence that following activist investors into investments can generate excess returns.
Schedule 13G forms, in contrast, are filed by significant investors with no intention of influencing management
(such as Index funds).

There is always a lot of interest in insider trades, but what a lot of people probably don't realize
is that hedge fund activity is probably more predictive of future returns than insider activity.
The reason is that hedge funds (a) have large research budgets, and (b) have a choice where to put their money.
In contract, insiders have no choice where to put their money, but only when to time their transactions.

## New Filings
This table lists new 13D filings in the last week. A new filing does not necessarily indicate a new position,
as investors frequently accumulate in advance before reaching the filing threshold.

228,DELL,$DELL looks like it will hit $65-$70 by end of April,"Their financials are on the 28th. Expect great numbers, and even better future outlook. They will go UP

Expect some announcement regarding their 80% holding of VMware

&amp;#x200B;

Dell Technologies (DELL) closed the most recent trading day at $55.54, moving +0.91% from the previous trading session. This move outpaced the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 0.18%. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.24%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 0.03%.

Prior to today's trading, shares of the computer and technology services provider had gained 24.92% over the past month. This has outpaced the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 5.62% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.28% in that time.

DELL will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be February 28, 2019. In that report, analysts expect DELL to post earnings of $1.89 per share.

[Zacks.com](https://Zacks.com) lists DELL as a BUY

DELL has a PEG ratio of 0.67. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. 

DELL currently has a forward P/E ratio of 8.01 

DELL is its P/B ratio of 2.96. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. 

Based on these metrics and many more, DELL holds a Value grade of A 

&amp;#x200B;

145,DELL,Thoughts on DELL?,"Wondering what peoples' thoughts might be on DELL.

I'm an amateur doing some amateur analysis...

Looking at ""Liabilities &amp; Shareholders' Equity"", that number is going up year after year, which is good, right? I assume that means they aren't going bankrupt.

What's looks a bit troubling though I guess... is their net income seems to be going down ever so slightly.

Equity-wise, there's about $122B in equity for Dell, so a loss of $3B in net income doesn't seem all that bad, but it's a tiny bit concerning I guess.

On the plus side, their sales and revenue is increasing YOY.

Any thoughts?",5,19,1550674743.0,2019-02-20T14:59:03+00:00,t3_asp9ld,stocks
120,DELL,Significant Activist Hedge Fund Activity (Last 7 Days),"These are the latest Schedule 13D forms filed by activist investors in the last 7 days. Activist
investors are investors that make an investment with the intention of influencing management in some way.
There is evidence that following activist investors into investments can generate excess returns.
Schedule 13G forms, in contrast, are filed by significant investors with no intention of influencing management
(such as Index funds).

There is always a lot of interest in insider trades, but what a lot of people probably don't realize
is that hedge fund activity is probably more predictive of future returns than insider activity.
The reason is that hedge funds (a) have large research budgets, and (b) have a choice where to put their money.
In contract, insiders have no choice where to put their money, but only when to time their transactions.

## New Filings

146,DELL,Prediction: Apple to crash in price 50% to $70 in the coming years (detailed analysis)," 

Smart phones are about 10 years behind desktop computers in terms of performance. Remember the first iphone in 2007? It was \~300mhz which was the speed of a pentium2 top-of-the-line desktop computer in 1997. If you look at the numbers you will find that this pattern roughly holds across many variables (memory capacity, gpu performance, cpu performance, etc.) . The first 1ghz CPUs arrived in 2000. First 1ghz smart phone? 2010.

1997-&gt;2007 was a period of rapid increases in desktop and laptop capability. Because of the huge speed gains, people rushed to upgrade every 2-3 years triggering huge sales and a boom for many companies like Dell, HP, etc. replacement cycles were very short in this time period. In 1997 it might have been as low as 2 years! This hugely inflated sales numbers.

2007 and 2008 were turning point years for desktop computers. It was clear then that the pace of improvement had slowed way down.

Over time the replacement cycle steadily increased. This really became noticeable in the late 00's around 2009-2010. Computer capability simply was not getting that much better every year by then so replacement cycles skyrocketed. People started holding on to desktops and laptops for 5+ years. This caused the industry to go into decline in 2011 and only recently came out of that.

I believe 2017 and 2018 were turning point years for smart phones. My personal phone (an iphone) was built in 2017 and I really have no plans to upgrade near term. How much better is the new one over a 2017 model? 20%? Is that worth $1000? I used to upgrade my phone yearly.

I think the 10 year difference will hold here. Replacement cycles are going to start skyrocketing and the industry will go into decline for a while just as the PC industry did.

Buying apple here is like buying DELL or HP back in 2009 but without the upside of selling to the corporate and server markets. Dell at least could sell servers to the booming web services economy. Apple is purely consumer.

I suspect Apple is trying to stave off this decline by jacking up prices which they have done in the past year. This might back fire triggering an even faster spike in replacement cycles.

Apple could easily fall another 50% from where we are today. Steer the hell away from this name.",0,20,1546568885.0,2019-01-04T02:28:05+00:00,t3_acde4q,stocks

122,DELL,Significant Activist Hedge Fund Activity (Last 7 Days),"These are the latest Schedule 13D forms filed by activist investors in the last 7 days. Activist
investors are investors that make an investment with the intention of influencing management in some way.
There is evidence that following activist investors into investments can generate excess returns.
Schedule 13G forms, in contrast, are filed by significant investors with no intention of influencing management
(such as Index funds).

There is always a lot of interest in insider trades, but what a lot of people probably don't realize
is that hedge fund activity is probably more predictive of future returns than insider activity.
The reason is that hedge funds (a) have large research budgets, and (b) have a choice where to put their money.
In contract, insiders have no choice where to put their money, but only when to time their transactions.

## New Filings
This table lists new 13D filings in the last week. A new filing does not necessarily indicate a new position,
as investors frequently accumulate in advance before reaching the filing threshold.

149,DELL,How to think about IBM RHT acquisition.,"A. Ibm is buying rht for $190 per share in cash. 

B. The price will pop up to near 190. IBM’s price may rise too if investor think this acquisition is a good fit. ( usually the target rises while the acquirer falls but in some cases, both will rise, eg. see recent Cloudera “merger” of Horton works)

C. There are a few ways to play this:

1. Buy RHT at less than 190. There will usually be a small spread under 190. M&amp;A/arbitrage specialists will try to see if any of the big guys will bid for rhat and potentially bring about a hostile bid. For example from HPQ or ORCL. If yes, the price will might go over 190. I think the 63% premium from Rht last closing is there to deter other bidders. 

While the arbitrage spread may only be a small, assuming there are no skeletons in closet, the deal will most likely close. The stated time frame is 2nd half of 2019. This means you don’t have to buy it now unless you can get a good spread. The arbitragers will typically borrow money to magnify the returns.  

Spread happens because people may not want to wait for a year for the transaction to be completed or if they feel the deal is in trouble. And the spread will widen or narrow until the deal closes. 

2. Buy other likely candidates

This purchase will likely motivate HPQ, MSFT, DELL and ORCL to acquire or form major alliances with other cloud based software companies.  I have no idea who but my Guess is ORCL and HPQ being the most likely to make the move next, since Dell’s debt load is already quite huge. MSFT is already leading in the cloud space so their acquisitions will likely be more niche.

The companies are:

- Salesforce ( pure play cloud applications company)

- Cloudera (Big data sw provider, recently merged with Horton works, now owns 80% market share, and expanding to the cloud). Currently MSFT and ORCL has an alliance with Cloudera.

The most interesting company is Pivotal, it makes  building blocks similar to RHAT’s open shift, it IPOed in 2018. However the majority share holder is Dell which controls 90+% of voting rights. HPQ and ORCL May not be able to buy PVTL but may announce major alliances with PVTL. The other player is Google with the Kubernetes technology that ORCL has an alliance with. 


( disclosure: I own insignificant shares of the above mentioned companies: PVTL, CRM, CLDR and MSFT)


(*edited* I included mostly old school tech acquirers here because they are most motivated to create their cloud and except for Microsoft, they are hardware companies.)

125,DELL,Significant Activist Hedge Fund Activity (Last 7 Days),"These are the latest Schedule 13D forms filed by activist investors in the last 7 days. Activist
investors are investors that make an investment with the intention of influencing management in some way.
There is evidence that following activist investors into investments can generate excess returns.
Schedule 13G forms, in contrast, are filed by significant investors with no intention of influencing management
(such as Index funds).

There is always a lot of interest in insider trades, but what a lot of people probably don't realize
is that hedge fund activity is probably more predictive of future returns than insider activity.
The reason is that hedge funds (a) have large research budgets, and (b) have a choice where to put their money.
In contract, insiders have no choice where to put their money, but only when to time their transactions.

## New Filings
This table lists new 13D filings in the last week. A new filing does not necessarily indicate a new position,
as investors frequently accumulate in advance before reaching the filing threshold.

151,DELL,"Stock Market Thread for the trading week beginning September 10th, 2018","Hello traders of the r/stocks sub!

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week of September 10th - 14th, 2018.

# **WEEK AHEAD: Tech in trade crosshairs after its worst week since March** - *[(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/07/tech-in-cross-hairs-after-its-worst-week-since-march.html)*

* Trade issues and inflation data are the big events for markets in the week ahead, as investors await President Trump's next move on tariffs on China.
* Technology stocks had their worst week since March amid a variety of issues, and some key companies, like Apple and Intel, are warning the government that proposed tariffs will hurt their businesses and consumers.
* CPI inflation data Thursday and PPI Wednesday could be a big focus after a surprise jump in wages in August.

*****

&gt; Technology stocks had their worst week since March, and they could remain in the crosshairs, particularly if the Trump administration unveils new tariffs on China.
*****
&gt; Strategists say inflation and trade are two major themes markets will have to navigate in the week ahead, after August's surprise jump in wage growth and as investors await the next move from Washington on the trade front.
*****
&gt; At any time, President Donald Trump could announce tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods, and he threatened Friday that he has plans for tariffs on another $267 billion ready to go. A late Friday afternoon news report that Apple warned the government that many of its products would be affected by tariffs hit that stock and sent ripples across the tech sector.
*****
&gt; The market Friday was already weak as investors considered the prospect of higher inflation. Average hourly wages, up nearly 2.9 percent, put markets on notice that more normal income growth — and therefore inflation — could be at hand.
*****
&gt; Consistently higher inflation could help reinforce the Fed's rate-hiking plans, and markets will be particularly alert to both producer and consumer inflation reports in the week ahead. ""I think it kind of reminds the markets that we could very quickly get back to February in a hurry, in the sense we've had this calm period here where inflation was dormant,"" said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group.
*****
&gt; The Apple report came at the end of a bad week for technology, with the S&amp;P sector down nearly 3 percent. First, there was the specter of more regulation for social media stocks and Google, as Facebook and Twitter executives testified before Congress Wednesday. On Thursday, chip stocks were hit by signs of a slowdown in orders, which some analysts blamed in part on trade. The chip selloff also raised concerns for the sector as a whole, since chip weakness is sometimes seen as an early warning for computer makers and others.
*****
&gt; ""To me, it's the piling on of information coming out of the technology sector,"" said Paulsen. ""It's something that everyone owns. It's been leading the stock market for the last three years and it's going to make you [wonder] through the weekend [whether] that's ending…People did think Apple was immune from this.""
*****
&gt; Apple, in a letter to the government, said the tariffs could result in higher prices for consumers and slower U.S. growth. It said products from the Apple Watch to MacMini would be affected by the proposed tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods. But there could also be positives for Apple in the week ahead, since it is unveiling new iPhone models and other products Wednesday.
*****
&gt; Other tech companies also warned the U.S. Trade Representative that the tariffs would have negative consequences, in reports after Friday's close. Agilent said the duties would financially impede its U.S. operations and end customers in the U.S. Intel said they would hurt advancements in telecommunications infrastructure, including next generation technologies, like 5G. Dell said tariffs, including on computer parts and switches, could do ""serious damage"" to the company and its employees.

# Typical September Trading: Another Historically Challenging Month

&gt; Although August is the worst month of the year for the market since 1987 (recent 31-year period), September is the worst month going back to 1950 for DJIA and S&amp;P 500. It is also the worst month for NASDAQ since 1971 and the worst for Russell 1000 and 2000 since 1979. Looking at the full month of September one day at a time, just before mid-month has offered the bulls the best opportunity with the chart exhibiting strength from around the close of the sixth trading day to the close of the thirteenth trading day. The tenth and twelfth trading days briefly interrupt the trend. After this stretch, the final third of the month is generally weak with all five indexes quickly surrendering earlier month gains.

# Why the S&amp;P 500 Monthly Win Streak Could Have Bulls Smiling

&gt; After gaining 19.4% last year, the S&amp;P 500 is once again surging in 2018—up nearly 8.0%, with the Nasdaq 14.8% and Russell 2000 11.7% up even more as of 09/06/18. Could there be even more gains in store over the coming year? We think so.

&gt; With a 14-year high in manufacturing, consumer spending at its best pace in four years, contained inflation, and 20% earnings expected in 2018 and another 10% next year, the economy continues to be in very solid shape. Not to mention the S&amp;P 500 recently broke out to new all-time highs for the first time in nearly seven months, which historically has been followed by stronger than average returns in the coming year.

&gt; One more thing: A little-followed event just took place that has a solid track record for indicating potentially continued equity strength.

&gt; “The S&amp;P 500 just closed higher for the fifth consecutive month in August. Well, would you believe that the past 25 times that has happened, it was higher a year later 24 of those times?” explained Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

&gt; As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, a five-month win streak may be a great signal for continued strength. Take note that this time last year, the S&amp;P 500 was up five months in a row and many were concerned it had gone “too far too fast.” Twelve months later, it had added another 17.4%.

128,DELL,Goldman Sachs Had No Mandate When Musk Tweeted,"[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-14/goldman-sachs-is-said-to-have-had-no-mandate-when-musk-tweeted](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-14/goldman-sachs-is-said-to-have-had-no-mandate-when-musk-tweeted)

Elon Musk’s announcement about his advisers might be as squishy as his funding.

[Goldman Sachs Group Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GS:US) hadn’t been formally tapped as a financial adviser by [Tesla Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/TSLA:US)’s chief executive officer when Musk [revealed plans](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/PD3O0DAIBMDH)last week to take the automaker private and said he’d secured the funding for the transaction, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The bank still hadn’t officially signed on when Musk [said on Twitter](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-14/musk-working-with-silver-lake-goldman-to-take-tesla-private-jkt0o4sj) late Monday that he’s working with Goldman Sachs and private-equity firm Silver Lake as financial advisers, the people said.

Such a statement from a public company CEO typically signals a formal agreement. But Musk has shown a willingness to take an unusual approach, including tweeting last week that he had funding secured for a take-private deal. That declaration has prompted regulatory scrutiny and investor lawsuits.

[Read more: Musk’s explanation unlikely to get SEC off his back](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-13/musk-s-belated-explanation-is-unlikely-to-get-sec-off-his-back)

Conversations are ongoing between Goldman Sachs and Musk, said the people, asking not to be identified as the information isn’t public.

### Informal Advice

Silver Lake appears to be in a similar situation. The technology-focused firm isn’t working for Musk in an official capacity as a financial adviser and isn’t being compensated as a consultant, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Instead, Tesla’s CEO is hoping to tap Silver Lake’s experience working on some of the biggest take-private transactions -- including Michael Dell’s $21.7 billion buyout of his namesake computer company and its subsequent $67 billion acquisition of EMC Corp. -- to help get a deal done, the person said.

Each of those transactions involved the firm making an equity commitment to help fund the deal. While Silver Lake hasn’t committed any financing to Musk’s possible buyout of Tesla, the firm hasn’t ruled out potentially making an investment at some point, the person said.

A spokesman for Goldman Sachs declined to comment. Representatives for Silver Lake and Tesla didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Musk’s latest tweet came just hours after he said Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund had first approached him about helping take Tesla private early last year, and that the fund’s interest gave him the confidence to state publicly that he was thinking about the move.

“I left the July 31st meeting with no question that a deal with the Saudi sovereign fund could be closed, and that it was just a matter of getting the process moving,” Musk [wrote](https://www.tesla.com/blog/update-taking-tesla-private) in a blog post Monday.

Tesla’s board is in the process of selecting financial advisers to evaluate Musk’s proposal. It has [formed a special committee](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-14/tesla-go-private-effort-advances-with-board-panel-to-study-offer), according to a statement Tuesday, which will take legal advice from Latham &amp; Watkins LLP and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &amp; Rosati.",95,28,1534275177.0,2018-08-14T19:32:57+00:00,t3_97bea4,StockMarket
153,DELL,Multi Monitor Setup?,"I think I""m ready to reup on a new computer - currently using a Macbook pro 15"", so I'm considering Dell's sale atm. What monitors do you guys use for the multi monitor setup? I was looking at getting a couple of Dell 27"" ultrasharps, but have seen there's surprisingly poor reviews, at least on the Canadian site.

Arista is going crazing, IV of 22 is very low for the current market environment where it even seems S&amp;P is going to go up by 30% percent in next 6 months. 

I'm non professional trader. 


My Knowledge on Cisco: It seems they want to go to the fight before losing anymore market share in networking to Arista and Juniper. Non-Switching lines are looking fair. Very competitive but nothing too fruitful. Looking lot better than HP and Dell. 

Price range of $45 will happen on auto pilot without considering the words of the CEO or CFO in next 6 months. ",1,9,1517119364.0,2018-01-28T06:02:44+00:00,t3_7til1y,options

54,DELL,stockAday: is PureStorage Flash Gordon or a flash in the pan? $PSTG,"What could be simpler than a storage business? No not self-storage containers on the edge of town, but storage of data for companies. IPOed at $17 two years ago, Pure Storage is still under water. Should we tread carefully?

# Key Stats
|Ticker|[PSTG](https://stockflare.com/stock/pstg.k)
|:---:|:---:|
Sector | Storage Devices
Latest price | $15.99
Value | $3,382M
Daily vol | $32M
Date | 02 October 2017
Financials | [SEC Filings](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&amp;CIK=0001474432&amp;type=10&amp;dateb=&amp;owner=exclude&amp;count=40)
Website | [purestorage.com](https://www.purestorage.com/)

# 1. What's so great about Flash?

Pure Storage is focused on delivering software-defined all-flash solutions that are fast and cloud-capable for customers, enabling customers to put data to work for their businesses. 

Now that sounds a bit complicated, doesn't it. And why is flash memory so much better than hard disks? Here's their _pitch_ from their IPO:

&gt; Our business model builds on our technology innovations to reverse the traditional storage business model. Instead of moving data between old and new systems via forklift upgrades, we keep business data and applications in place and upgrade technology around it. Our platform and business model are designed to add value to customers for a decade or more, reducing total cost of storage ownership while increasing loyalty. 

Sorry, but that is still gobbledygook to me. And it didn't get any easier, the more I read.

Still they must be doing something right, as they've over 3,700 customers including 25% of the Fortune 500. Though watch out, they note that it's a ""high touch"" sales model. I expect it has to be if you are selling million dollar critical storage infrastructure to big corporates!

# 2. How's it working out?

The growth until the January 2016 was remarkable, with sales accelerating. But the year to Jan 2017, and the forecasts for this year, show a market slowdown. Now, adding $300m a year is brilliant, don't misunderstand me, it's just that it's not _stellar_! And it's not long before Wall Street things they'll turn a profit. 

|January|2013A|2014A|2015A|2016A|2017A|2018E|2019E|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $6m | $43m | $174m | $440m | $728m| $1,010m | $1,317m|
|EPS | N/A | N/A | $-6.56 | $-2.59 | $-1.26| $-0.21 | $+0.04|

On top of that with $523M of net cash, (15% of the market value) the company has some room, in case of hiccups. Separately, they don't pay a dividend, as it's growth model.

However, I am a little concerned by the long-term expectations. Here's how they [see margins](https://s21.q4cdn.com/687136699/files/doc_financials/presentations/Earning-Slides-(Q2-FY18)_FINAL.pdf) on page 15 of their July Quarter presentation.

|as % of sales|Last Quarter | Long Term|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
Gross margin | 67% | 63 to 68%|
R&amp;D costs | 23% | 15 to 20%|
Sales costs | 49% | 25 to 30%|
General costs | 8% | 5 to 7%|
Operating margin | -12% | 15 to 20%|

They'd have to half marketing to get to a reasonable profit. Which seems an aggressive assumption. Sure, they've grown revenue faster than costs the last 3 years, but there's no evidence they can get to that target yet.  

# 3. How do they compare?

It's hard to find a reasonable group of competitors. There are tiny companies like Quantum and Tintri. Firms like NetApp who bought into the market. Legacy firms like Seagate and Western Digital. And some big-boys like Dell, HP, IBM, and Hitachi.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Pure Storage Inc | $832M | -19% | -51%
Quantum Corp | $506M | 4% | N/A
Tintri Inc | $140M | -84% | N/A
NetApp Inc. | $5,550M | 18% | 21%
Western Digital Corp | $19,093M | 23% | 4%
Seagate Technology PLC | $10,771M | 18% | 52%

And if you are wondering about the big-boys... when talking about the competition, they note:

&gt; The acquisitions of EMC by Dell, Nimble Storage by HP Enterprise and SolidFire by NetApp have introduced new competitive dynamics into the storage market. 

Excuse me if I find that ominous.

# 4. Struggling with the valuation

It's never easy to hang my hat on a loss-making business. :( Especially a high grower. And in the case of $PSTG even the sales multiple is way ahead of the entire group.

Peers|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|Price to Sales|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
PSTG.K | $3,382M | -74x | 40% | 0% | 3.4x
QTM | $211M | 13x | 20% | 0% | 0.6x
TNTR.O | $98M | -1x | N/A | 0% | 0.6x
NTAP.O | $11,805M | 14x | 16% | 2% | 1.6x
WDC.O | $25,503M | 7x | 26% | 2% | 1.7x
STX.O | $9,547M | 9x | 22% | 8% | 1.1x

If I want to be generous, I do a back of the envelope, cash flow analysis. Say they grow sales by $300m every year, at a 20% margin and pay a 25% tax rate. That would yield an extra $45m of cash a year. Discount that over the next 30 years at 8%, add in the cash in the bank and I get to $23 a share. Though warning... tweak the assumptions and blow up the result.

# 5. Has Wall Street given up?

The loyal brokers of Wall Street that IPOed the business 2 years ago, still say _Buy_. Though they've cut their target from $22 a share at the IPO to $16. Gawd... that's where the stock is.

What's a little weird is that the company has beaten earnings and sales forecasts every quarter since the IPO. And that's not driven the stock up. 

Though in August the company appointed a new CEO, Charles Giancarlo, which has lead to increased optimism. He was a key man at Cisco, then went on to be a venture capitalist. He's on the board of Accenture, Arista and ServiceNow. So nicely connected!

# 6. Flash Gordon or flash in the pan? 

I hate buying stocks when I don't really understand what their edge is. Is $PSTG growing fast because it's a great solution at a reasonable price? O is the price too cheap? Meaning they can never really generate much cashflow? I just can't tell.

But what I can see, is that sales aren't accelerating. They are growing fast, but if I'm looking for a moon-shot, it has to show that sales are going to go exponential. No sign here... yet.

Perhaps the game here is M&amp;A, that the new CEO will dress it up for sale. But I'd prefer to invest on fundamentals, not hope. 

For now, I'm not storing my cash in $PSTG.

55,DELL,Who is left on Trump's Manufacturing Council? A list thanks to Business Insider.,"Thanks to all the posts and press today about three CEOs leaving the President's manufacturing council, I thought there would only be a few people left. Boy, was I wrong.

- Michael Polk, Newell Brands

My biggest hang up is what kind of graphics card or multiple cards I should use to connect all 6 monitors using mini displayport 1.2?

Alternatively three 30"" monitors in portrait with Winsplit or similar software to divide the screens into 6 windows would also be a consideration.

# Description

Hewlett Packard Enterprise is a provider of technology solutions and operates through five segments: 

* The Enterprise Group segment provides its customers with the technology infrastructure they need to optimize traditional information technology (IT). 
* The Enterprise Services segment brings all of its solutions together through its consulting and support professionals. 
* The Software segment allows its customers to automate IT operations to simplify, accelerate and secure business processes and drives the analytics that turn raw data into actionable knowledge. 
* The Financial Services segment enables flexible IT consumption models, financial architectures and customized investment solutions for its customers. 
* The Corporate Investments segment includes Hewlett Packard Labs and certain business incubation projects, among others.

There have been two reasonable M&amp;A moves recently as [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett_Packard_Enterprise#History) points out. 

* May 2016, the spin off of the Enterprise Services unit to CSC. Target completion on 1st April 2017. As result... HPE shareholders will get 50.1% of the new company, in a tax-free spin-off of shares. Worth circa $4.5bn. The new company will inherit $2.5bn of HPE debt, and HPE will get a $1.5bn cash dividend. i.e. sale price of $8.5bn.
* Sept 2016, the spin off of the Software unit to MicroFocus in the UK. Target completion on 21st August 2017. As result... HPE shareholders will get 50.1% of the new shares, worth $6.3bn. With HPE getting a $2.5bn cash dividend. i.e. sale price of $8.8bn.

## The Segments?

How important are these divisions? Well here's the company breakdown, for the full year to Oct 2016.

|Metric|Ent. Group|Ent. Service|Software|Fin Service|Corp. Investments| Total
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $27.2bn | $18.9bn | $3.2bn | $3.2bn | $0.003bn| $50.1bn |
|Operational Earnings | $3.5bn | $1.5bn | $0.7bn | $0.3bn | -$0.3bn| $4.2bn |

Hmmm. So HPE today worth $41bn and trading at 10x Operating Earnings, is selling Enterprise Services as 6x and Software at 13x. Now you might think 6x is low for its consulting arm but its sales were off 5% last year. And if you think 13x is low for a Software unit, well its sales were off 12%.

Sadly, what's left is hardly that exciting with the Enterprise Group and Fin Services both seeing revenues and margins down!

## Recent financials 

Okay, enough whining by me, let's look at the history. Though this is ""adjusted"" as the business really wasn't separate in 2012 to 2015, from HP Inc.

|Metric|2016A|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $50.1bn | $52.1bn | $55.1bn | $57.4bn | $61.0bn|
|EPS | $1.82 | $1.34 | $0.90 | $1.12 | -$8.05|

Well, it's nice to see they are squeezing more and more profit of of the business.

But remember, 2017's going to be a transitional year. They'll have sold 44% their sales and 52% of their profits for 42% of their value. Doesn't sound great. And with the business likely to swing to a $7.5bn net cash position, I wonder what will they do with the money? Any ideas? Sure there's room to buy back stock...

...but M&amp;A sounds likely. And do you trust this management team to create value?

## Competition

Let's focus on the business that survive the spin offs. 

Enterprise Group:

&gt; Our primary competitors include technology vendors such as Dell, Cisco, NetApp, Lenovo, Amazon, Oracle, Fujitsu, Juniper Networks, Inspur, Hitachi, Extreme Networks, Pure Storage, Brocade, VMware, Nutanix, Google and Rackspace.

&gt;  In our financing business, our competitors are captive financing companies, mainly IBM Global Financing, as well as banks and other financial institutions. 

What? Is this a bit like Ford being a bank than monetize via cars?

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co | $50,123M | 15% | 10%
Brocade Communications Systems, Inc. | $2,346M | 20% | 8%
Cisco Systems, Inc. | $48,570M | 31% | 16%
Dell Technologies Inc | $55,513M | 4% | -32%
Extreme Networks, Inc | $535M | 4% | -31%
International Business Machines Corp. | $79,918M | 20% | 73%
Juniper Networks, Inc. | $4,990M | 22% | 13%
NetApp Inc. | $5,418M | 15% | 11%
Nutanix Inc | $524M | -45% | N/A
Oracle Corporation | $37,236M | 42% | 19%
Pure Storage Inc | $650M | -26% | -46%
VMware, Inc. | $7,092M | 26% | 15%

When the spin offs are done, margins will decline on average. :( and when I look at the margins and returns of ragbag of peers, HPE doesn't stand out.

## Cash / Debt?

HPE has $230M of net debt. That is Zero times it's latest operating profit. And by the end of the year... they'll be swimming in cash!

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $24.74 for Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. Odd that, given it implies an upside of 1% to their target.

# Valuation

Across the board, its hard to be impressed by valuations in this sector. So maybe there's an opportunity for the savvy value investor?

But if so, why would you buy HPW when there are other stocks on the same valuation, paying higher dividends and forecast to grow stronger?

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/hpe/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
HPE | $40,622M | 12x | 1% | 1% | 17%
BRCD.O | $5,017M | 12x | 8% | 1% | 8%
CSCO.O | $169,367M | 14x | 10% | 3% | 10%
DVMT.K | $13,959M | N/A | N/A | 0% | 1%
EXTR.O | $670M | 15x | 20% | 0% | 0%
IBM | $171,791M | 13x | 3% | 3% | 12%
JNPR.K | $10,797M | 13x | 11% | 2% | 9%
NTAP.O | $11,062M | 15x | 15% | 2% | 7%
NTNX.O | $4,477M | -ve | N/A | 0% | -ve
ORCL.K | $172,545M | 16x | 8% | 1% | 8%
PSTG.K | $2,389M | -ve | 35% | 0% | -ve
VMW | $37,543M | 19x | 11% | 0% | 4%

Okay, maybe just maybe the sector or even HPE can see a bit of valuation expansion, but where's the long-term growth? With Services and Software gone, there's no more ""excitement"" from a restructuring perspective, is there?

# Dividends

Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co is forecast to pay a dividend of $0.25 per share, compared to a forecast EPS of $2.04. And yes, there's going to be buyback on top!

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 6% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 6%. So the PE multiple's been stuck at 12x. Sure it was as low as 8x a year ago... but where's the catalyst from here?

On the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers, they said

&gt; We continue to expect fiscal year 2017 non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $2 to $2.10 for the combined HPE, as it stands today. $1.25 to $1.35 for the future HPE and reported EPS of $1.45 to $1.55.

Note: Adjusted EPS was $1.92 (yes, I hate adjusted figures) in 2016. So $2.00 to $2.10, that's 4 to 9% growth. Nice, so such a boring stock. But what's with ""reported"" of $1.45 to $1.55. [Here's](http://investors.hpe.com/~/media/Files/H/HP-Enterprise-IR/documents/ceo-presentation.pdf) the CEO's presentation. And the CFO's [presentation](http://investors.hpe.com/~/media/Files/H/HP-Enterprise-IR/documents/cfo-financial-overview.pdf).

&gt; cash will be significantly impacted by restructuring and separation payments, the ES pension funding

What!!! Look at the CFO's deck. A standard $3.6-3.9bn of free cashflow turns into -$1.8bn in 2017. With $0.7bn of restructuring, $1.5bn of separation payments and $2.5bn of pension payments? Suddenly the $17.3bn valuation of Services and Software looks like $12.6bn. But hey... don't worry, it's going thro' the income statement as ""extra-ordinary"" charges. 

All that aside, they are spinning out $4.5bn of equity value for Services and $6.3bn for Software. i.e. the adjusted share price would be circa $18 a share. And they are suggesting an ""adjusted EPS"" of $1.25 to $1.35. i.e. today the future HPE is trading on 14x?

Hardly attractive.

Regardless, I just can't see any reason to own this stock. Ugly market, lots of competition, every catalyst I can imagine triggered, and a management team that's disappointed again and again having a massive cash pile. Oh... and someone that loves talking about ""Adjusted earnings"".

# Description

Skyworks Solutions Inc. designs, develops, manufactures and markets semiconductor products, including intellectual property. The Company's analog semiconductors are used in the automotive, broadband, cellular infrastructure, connected home, industrial, medical, military, smartphone, tablet and wearable markets. Its product portfolio consists of various solutions, including amplifiers, attenuators, detectors, diodes, filters, front-end modules, hybrid, mixers, switches, and modulators. Gawd, that sounds nerdy, doesn't it?

Perhaps, but the client list doesn't :) Arris, Bose, Cisco, Dell, Foxconn, Fujitsu, General Electric, Google, Honeywell, HTC, Huawei, Landis &amp; Gyr, Lenovo, LG Electronics, Microsoft, Nest, Netgear, Northrop Grumman, OPPO, Rockwell Collins, Samsung, Sonos, VIVO, and ZTE. 

Though, it's the theme of ubiquitous wireless &amp; IoT that's probably the most exciting part of this story:

* huge growth is wireless connectivity
* lots of different frequencies and technologies
* a need for seamless handoffs, signal transmission, etc
* more efficient power management
* design challenges with a need for light, small, slimline offerings
* a move from discrete components to customized integrated circuits
* and finally huge demand unfulfilled in emerging markets for smart phone

With that backdrop SWKS highlights

&gt; We are at the forefront of advanced multi-chip module integration and offer unmatched technology breadth, providing deep expertise in CMOS, SOI, GaAs and filters and maintaining strategic partnerships with outside foundries.

Forgive me Nvidia shareholders, but is SWKS the ugly sister / cousin?

## Recent financials 

aside: it's a Sept year end.

Looking at the figures, there's nothing exciting about the top line. Though the change in product mix from regular phones to smart phones is helping to drive higher margins and better earnings. 

|Metric|2016A|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $3.3bn | $3.3bn | $2.3bn | $1.8bn | $1.6bn|
|EPS | $5.18 | $4.10 | $2.38 | $1.45 | $1.05|

Plus they arn't shy about acquiring competitors.

## Competition

They don't paint a rosy picture about the overall market &amp; the competition, but hey, this is the chip industry, so what's new!

&gt; The wireless communications semiconductor industry in general and the other analog markets in which we compete in particular are very competitive. We compete with international and United States semiconductor manufacturers of all sizes in terms of resources and market share, including, but not limited to, Analog Devices, Broadcom, Maxim Integrated Products, Murata Manufacturing, NXP Semiconductors, QUALCOMM, and Qorvo. We currently face significant competition in our markets and expect that intense price and product competition will continue. This competition has resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in, declining average selling prices for our products and increased challenges in maintaining or increasing revenue, gross margin and market share. 

Now let's put the narrative to one side and look at margins and returns. Wow... best in class. Even QCOM would be jealous. ;)

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Skyworks Solutions Inc | $3,289M | 42% | 30%
Analog Devices, Inc. | $3,421M | 37% | 17%
Broadcom Ltd | $13,240M | 28% | -14%
Maxim Integrated Products Inc. | $2,194M | 33% | 21%
Microsemi Corporation | $1,655M | 21% | -2%
NXP Semiconductors NV | $8,664M | 20% | 11%
QUALCOMM, Inc. | $23,554M | 35% | 18%
Qorvo Inc | $2,792M | 27% | -1%

## Cash / Debt?

Skyworks Solutions Inc has $1,084M of net cash. That is the equivalent of 7% of the market value of Skyworks Solutions Inc. So management's keeping some powder dry in case a nice little competitor can be snapped up.

In fact they tried to buy PMC Sierra in 2015, only to lose to Microsemi. Though good to see they gave up instead of destroying shareholder value and overpaying.

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $86.30 for Skyworks Solutions Inc and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 10% to their target.

# Valuation

When it comes to valuation it's on 13x and that's at the bottom on the sector. Seems a bit weird, given the high margins and good returns. Though the dividend yield is a little disappointing.

QRVO.O | $7,481M | 13x | 15% | 0% | 8%

# Dividends

Skyworks Solutions Inc is forecast to pay a dividend of $1.13 per share, compared with a forecast EPS of $6.13.

And they've bought back circa $1bn of stock over the last 3 years.

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 2% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 11%. Though frankly, that EPS upgrade is really just the rolling forward to the new fiscal year, with an expectation of sales up to $3.5bn in the coming year, and a tiny bit of margin improvement.

Supposedly the detractors worry they are too exposed to Apple and the iPhone. An Interesting aside is the stock's up 900% in the last 10 years versus Apple up 800% and the darling Nvidia up 400%. Though... the fears are justified. 40% of last years sales were to Foxconn (who work for Apple) and 10% were to Samsung! Ouch. 

So, do I want to invest in a 50% smartphone play 50% other (IoT etc)? At 13x it's bang in line with Apple or Intel. And it's cheaper than a lot of the banks stocks. 

Maybe this is one of those delightful ""boring stock"", that will perform a dream over the long-term... though in terms of an economic moat, I fail to see a particularly strong one. 

Any long-term owners here on reddit?

Is the value of the shares only influenced by the performance of Dell Technologies holdings of VMware? 

If so, what makes these shares any more worthwhile than VMware shares? It seems like they would stand to have to same benefits of the acquisition as the ordinary shares of VMware. 

Is the tracking stock pretty much a means to use less cash to complete the acquisition?

Converged data center infrastructure provider Nutanix today announced that it has raised $237.9 million in its initial public offering, as a result of selling $14.87 million in shares at $16 per share. That’s up from $15 per share in the most recent revision to its initial public offering (IPO) filing from September 28 and up from $13 per share in a September 19 revision.

Nutanix is set to start trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol NTNX on September 30. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are the lead book-running managers in the deal, according to a statement.

Nutanix first filed paperwork for its IPO in December but held off on the proceedings for several months.

This is one of the bigger technology IPOs so far this year. Others that have gone out this year include Acacia Communications, Dell’s SecureWorks, Line, Talend, and Twilio.

Nutanix came up with a $168.4 million net loss on $444.9 million in revenue — mostly product, and the rest from support and services — in the year that ended on July 31. The company had 3,768 customers as of July 31, up from 782 two years prior to that. Customers include AT&amp;T, Airbus, Deloitte, Staples, and Yahoo. Based in San Jose, California, Nutanix had 1,980 employees on July 31.

Nutanix’s investors include Battery Ventures, Blumberg Capital, Fidelity, Khosla Ventures, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Morgan Stanley Expansion Capital, Riverwood Capital Partners, and Sapphire Ventures.",12,18,1475256796.0,2016-09-30T17:33:16+00:00,t3_5591nf,investing
8,DELL,stockAday: HP Inc keeps printing... $HPQ,"# Key Stats for HP Inc

The one year anniversary approaches of Meg Whitman abandoning HP and sailing off with the Enterprise division. In that time, HPE's gone from $14 to $20. 

But poor old HPQ has found itself taking a dive to a low of $9 and only recently making it back to $14. Nice one Meg. 

So is HPQ a value trap?

# Description

HP is a leading global provider of personal computing and other access devices, imaging and printing products, and related technologies, solutions and services. HP sells to individual consumers, small- and medium-sized businesses (""SMBs"") and large enterprises, including customers in the government, health and education sectors.

In reality, all that's left are PCs and Printers :( And the tail wags the dog. Sales in Printers was $14bn v PCs' $22bn, but Printers pre-tax earnings were $2.5bn v PCs earning $0.8bn. 

## Recent financials 

Given the separation of HPE, I don't have a handy look at the sales, so here's the data for the last nine months.

|9 months to |July 2015A| July 2016A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $39bn | $36bn | 
|EPS | $1.20 | $1.23 | 

So yes, business is still going backwards, but it's a graceful decline for the behemoth and the earnings are managing to rise a little as efficiencies are made.

## Competition

The competition in PCs is the usual list of suspects: Lenovo, Dell, Acer, ASUSTeK, Apple, Toshiba and Samsung. And in Printers we've all heard the names too: Canon, Lexmark, Xerox, Seiko Epson, Ricoh, Samsung and Brother.

What's pretty remarkable for such a cut-throat market that feels so commodity is (a) double digit markets and (b) high returns are possible! Though it looks like the Printer companies are in better shape than the PC ones.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
HP Inc | $47,992M | 11% | 32%
Dell Technologies Inc | $52,933M | 5% | N/A
Lenovo Group Limited (ADR) | $44,252M | 1% | -ve
Apple Inc. | $220,288M | 34% | 38%

Lexmark International Inc | $3,489M | 12% | -ve
Xerox Corp | $17,652M | 11% | 4%

aside: Dell Tech is the merged Dell / EMC monster, so maybe the comparison there isn't fair. Plus I get the impression that Wall Street isn't yet covering the stock properly.

## Cash / Debt?

HP Inc has $1,199M of net debt. That is 0.2x its latest operating profit. So nothing to worry about, In fact they could probably manage a little M&amp;A if they wanted. 

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $15.54 for HP Inc and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 10% to their target.

# Valuation

At 9 times earnings it could well be cheap, but maybe there's a reason. Is it a value trap? Both units are in decline and the better one seems like it's declining fastest.

# Dividends

HP Inc is forecast to pay a dividend of $0.53 per share. Which compares to a forecast EPS of $1.60. The company has substantial room to do share buyback, but hasn't been too aggressive to date.

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 8% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 1%. On a 6 month basis the stocks up 23% with no change in the earnings forecasts. So it's fair to say the stock's re-rated off its lows. 

Looking at the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers there is a lot of talk about efficiencies, a rich heritage, the margins in the printer business, divestitures, and even a mention of innovation.  On the negative side... they worried about Brexit and the EU economy.

It's hard to see where the catalysts come. 

* Sure there should be some industrial consolidation in both PCs and Printers, but is HPQ the buyer or the seller? 
* Management's done a good job protecting the cash cow to-date, but is there a moment where the printer business' margins crumble?
* And innovation... without, isn't this stock going to remain ex-growth? And if you want an ex-growth stock, isn't Apple or Gilead a more appealing option?

For now, I'm in two minds, yes the 4% divie is nice, and there looks like there is room for more, but the long-term outlook is grim. 

Can anyone see a bright future?

* Tracking stocks current value is around 42 (link - https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=dvmtv)
* The deal with tracking stock is that its going to track to VMware. 
* VMware is currently around 73. 

**Query:**

* When the deal happens, bunch of EMC people are going to sell the stock to free up their cash. When this happens, the tracking stock value should collapse.
At this point, would you guys suggest picking up the tracking stock?

The company is moving away from its primary cash cow, VSphere, and introducing newer products to make up for the slowdown but that will take some time to ramp up.

Dell Computers went private in 2013.

74,DELL,Amazon Stock Price: Killing Me Softly,"Well f**k.  Amazon (AMZN) just announced that they made $92MM last quarter versus a loss of $126MM in the same quarter last year.  So what did investors do?  They decided to reward Amazon with an $85 per share increase after hours.  That’s an additional $40Billion or so in value added.  So now they are officially worth more than Wal-Mart.  And that is beyond stupid…and here is why:

In the last twelve months (TTM – Trailing Twelve Months), Wal-Mart has $485Billion in revenue.  Amazon has $96Billion in the last 12 months.  So Wal-Mart, by sales, is 5 times larger.  But it is worth LESS?!?!?! Ok…maybe it’s about profit…

In the last twelve months, Wal-Mart has made $16Billion in net income.  Amazon has LOST $188MM.  Wait.  So Wal-Mart has MADE A PROFIT of $16Billion and Amazon has LOST $188,000,000….LOST….Oh but wait, everyone says it’s about the growth…

I know.  So Amazon’s BEST argument is that they are investing in more and more things to make the experience for users better and grow their media collection and blah blah blah.  Ok. Fine.  Then why can’t you make money off of $96B EVEN DOING THAT?!?!

Their best margins ever were almost 4%…Wal-Mart, which is brick and mortar and supposed to cost more, is higher on average.  So let’s assume that they hit 4% in profit margin in the long run because of their investments and they finally start to turn a profit…on $96Billion in sales, that’s profit of $3.8Billion. So at a market cap of $265Billion, that’s a price to earnings ratio of 70 still! Which is still 5 times more than historical averages especially for such a mature company because REMEMBER, Amazon is  a MATURE company. It isn’t a start-up! It’s been around for 20 years!

Sure it is! They surprised everyone by growing 20% from last year’s same quarter.  Ok. So let’s assume they continue to grow 20% per year and let’s assume Wal-Mart only grows at 3% per year…how long will it take for Amazon to catch up?  Remember, assuming 20% growth per year is HIGHLY unlikely…is it impossible? No.  But even Amazon’s growth since 2007 has slowed significantly.  From 2007 to 2008, before the big recession, Amazon’s revenue grew 30%.  So there is going to be a slow down.  Have they had better years since then?  Sure, but here is their year over year growth since 2007: 30%, 27.9%, 39.5%, 40.5%, 27%, 21.9%, 19.5%, and this last quarter they SURPRISED everyone with 20% growth.

So back to my point: Let’s assume 20% growth for Amazon every year and only 3% for Wal-Mart every year…In 10 years, Amazon’s revenue will be $595Billion and Wal-Mart’s revenue will be $651Billion! They still haven’t caught up to Wal-Mart! And even at $595Billion in revenue and 4% profit margin, which I remind you they have never achieved, they will have profit of $24Billion which is still only 10 times earnings of TODAY’S MARKET VALUE!…which is about where stocks should sell for during a bad bear market.  So let’s even assume that it should sell for the same multiple as Wal-Mart, which is around 15 or so historically. That’s a valuation of $360Billion which is 35% higher than today.

Soooooo…follow me here…Today’s market value of Amazon is 35% lower than what it should be if it were to grow at 20% per year for 10 more years AND have profit margins it has never seen before.  Does it sound optimistic?  Absolutely.  Yes, Amazon is winning the popularity contest right now, but no companies does that for decades.  Microsoft didn’t. Google didn’t.  Dell didn’t. IBM didn’t.  No one does.  And sometime in there, it will massively correct.  And when it does, it will be ugly.  Until then, my bank account looks ugly.

170,DELL,ONCS - Amy Chan,"&gt; Hi XXXXXXXX,
&gt; 
&gt; I understand that people are curious as to when data is going to be announced. As we discussed before, there are many factors that can change the timing (timing that we state clearly on our milestones page as ""tentative and subject to change"". Factors include enrollment, aggregation of data, third parties, analyzation of data, etc. This company has gone from zero programs to launching three Phase II trials, announcing positive data on two of those programs, adding a research pipeline, announcing preliminary data on the research – all within two years. Not sure if you can name another biotech company that has executed such an aggressive pipeline within such a short timeframe. I cannot think of one that has been able to do what we've done at such speed. 
&gt; 
&gt; The post you mention to ""demonstrate honesty"" jumps to conclusions. Our CMO, left a large pharma to join our team – how can that be construed as a negative? He's extremely reputable and has a lot of experience with PD-1. That's excellent for us, as we understand that ImmunoPulse can potentially be a great combination therapy. 
&gt; 
&gt; His example of the other company and comparing to us is silly. Because we are adding to our pipeline with a research study on combination therapy, he is suggesting we have bad data? 
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not going to get in to each of his points which are filled with assumptions because he wants to fill in the blanks. To be honest with you Dell, I'm glad he sold his shares. Because if he doesn’t believe in what we do, what we're building and what we've demonstrated so far, then he shouldn't be invested in the company. We are all working like crazy over here to do something that can potentially make a great difference to those with cancer. We have a small team, wear multiple hats, and every data announcement so far has been positive. Of course I too, wanted the stock price to soar when we announced positive data in the past, but just because the market didn't respond the way ""he wanted it to"" doesn't equate that the data isn't positive. OncoSec is an undervalued company, we have strong fundamentals and are continuing to build on that. I just finished a roadshow in LA and NYC, I've met with many funds and investors who believe in the fundamentals. I speak to investors like yourself, that believe in the company's future. Those are the people who should be investing in the company. Not conspiracy theorists.

**Dr. Pierce new CMO comments**

“We stand at a transformational moment in oncology. I’m convinced that intralesional therapy with IL12 drives systemic anti-tumor immune responses and has the potential to augment immunomodulatory therapies such as anti-PD-1.” 

Don't forget that 2 months ago ONCS reported positive results in their combination study with ODU, using ImmunoPulse with anti PD-1. His hiring will no doubt AUGMENT this study as he is was ""a key member of the global development team behind Merck’s FDA-designated “breakthrough” anti-PD-1 program (MK-3475)"".",13,12,1387142225.0,2013-12-15T21:17:05+00:00,t3_1syg88,stocks
77,DELL,Any quant/enthusiast can comment on building a high end rig for backtesting with MATLAB? Not sure where and what to look for. Budget around $5000,"So I was recently hired at this fairly old school shop and some of the MDs want to get into quant backtesting and stuff. I got MATLAB recently and very quickly proved my current 5 year old Dell workstation to be insufficient. I never had this much money to work with when it comes to getting a computer so I don't know what I need or look for. Any guys with more hardware experience can comment on what the industry standard is like? I'm a software person so this is not my most knowledgeable area.

I'll mainly be running Bloomberg for data and calculations in MATLAB. Maybe will buy some data if we need to get down to more details. Not doing any trading yet but it is a possibility in the future. I could go to Dell right now and get the highest setting of their best machine, but is there any other places and things I should look for?

**EDIT:** Okay it seems like I'm coming off as very clueless and unprepared about my specific needs. One thing I forgot to mention is that some of the analysis is not being done currently, they are planned for the future, tentatively. The stuff I do now is fine with my i5, takes a few minutes. I don't mind. The thing is that I need to have a machine that's well prepared for whatever I'm going to throw at it in the future. The purpose of this post is to get a survey/general impression of what people in the industry already do, in a very very general sense. I feel like at 5k I can pretty much push every spec in the machine to a fairly high level. Plus I dont think I need any GPU work so 5k for memory/storage/processor is pretty generous.

Right now I'm in line for an upgrade. So I'm trying to make sure whatever I pick would be sufficient for 99% of the application that is required by most trading/backtesting need. Yes, I know my code can be inefficient, and perhaps I'm not taking advantage of parallel computing fully. But that's not point of this post.",31,57,1386513040.0,2013-12-08T14:30:40+00:00,t3_1sdwkc,investing

The problem is, the account is with Schwab, but it was originally bought under Smith Barney, which is now Morgan Stanley, so the whole thing is kind of a mess. I've tried calling all the different institutions, but none of them have any record of it.

91,DELL,Rolling into a Roth IRA via vanguard,"So I currently have an employee sponsored 401k plan through vanguard but I am no longer employed at that company. I am set on rolling it over into a vanguard Roth IRA but I am having severe issues doing so. I have sent numerous emails to vanguard and they just point me at the rollover application built into their site, but I've gone through it 15 times and cannot find the word 'roth' anywhere and fear that I will roll into a traditional IRA if I proceed. The email support has been absolutely horrific and they will not help. 



Today their retirement contact phone line is suppose to be open until 4 P.M. Eastern Time, and I've been calling since 11AM CST and have called in on all different phone lines but I get to the same location no matter what options I choose unless I am seriously missing something. I then tried a technique I use with dell to get directly to a person, which is mumbling for the voice menu and eventually it gives up and gets me to someone, but it just told me to call back at a later time. 


I am extremely frustrated how long this has gone on, but I also fear that I am missing something. I assumed this process was very streamlined because the email responses I have gotten explained it as if it were simple(ex: Log into vanguard, select manage money, select roll over 401k) so I have waited patiently thinking that one of these emails(2 days to respond) would help me. Now I missed the bus on a few of my investments and by a fault of my own, some funds I was invested in took a hit which lost me close to five-hundred dollars. Out of fear and anticipation for the rollover, I pulled my money from all funds....which ended recovering causing me more frustration(completely my fault.) I take the blame for 99% of this, I just want to know if anyone is aware of a way to roll a 401k into a Roth IRA via the vanguard website.

DELL is a global company and I the need for enterprise systems isn't going away anytime soon.  If DELL can put any kind of comprehensive plan to dig into servers/cloud services/software/mobile app markets they should be able to leverage these extra services easily to their existing customers.

So, I guess I'm long on DELL . . . but I also know that I know nothing, what's your take on them?

94,DELL,Thoughts and Analysis on EMC and the Future of Data Storage,"I am thinking about initiating a position in EMC, either through buying shares or buying call options. If/when the price drops enough, I believe the growth possibilities will be too hard to ignore. I was wondering if anyone else had any thoughts on this in case there is something I overlooked. Here is why I believe EMC will make a good choice:

1. Data storage as an industry is ever growing. Revenues has been going higher and the demand for data storage will just keep growing as well. There will be a healthy demand for data storage for years to come as consumers upload more and more videos and pictures and as businesses accumulate more data and continue to switch from paper to paperless. Also, think about recent growing trends like Netflix and internet radio like Pandora. All those movies, tv shows, and songs must be stored somewhere before the consumer can stream it through the internet.
2. The financials for EMC are solid, growing revenues, low debt, good cash flow, decent P/E ratio, etc. In fact, some brief articles that I read suggest that EMC's market cap and P/E ratio should be even lower if you remove Vmware from the calculations (more on Vmware later).
3. EMC has consistently expanded its market share over the past 5-6 years. They own about 22% of the total disk storage market, up from 20% last year. In fact, only EMC and Netapp have had any noticeable gains in market share (EMC with the greatest), while others like Dell, HP, and even IBM have either remained stagnant or lost a bit of their market share.
4. As a result, EMC and Netapp are the only two companies to experience double digit percentage growth in revenues in this market.
5. In external disk storage systems, EMC's growth and market share is even greater.
6. Data storage involves good hardware and software. EMC has a strong software division since they own 80% of Vmware, which analysts are pretty high on too. Vmware appears to be collaborating with Cisco on software projects that involve virtualization and a next-gen cloud system. EMC will benefit from anything that Vmware and Cisco comes up with.

My only concerns are the competition, particularly from Netapp (probably EMC's strongest competitor), Oracle (and its subsidiary Sun Microsystems), IBM, and maybe even Hitachi. There seems to be plenty of growth in the industry for profits to go around but I don't want to underestimate strong industry players like IBM and Oracle. Also, I'm not an expert in IT, so if anyone can point out how EMC servers fare against its competition, that would be nice. I did some EMC vs Netapp searches and there seems to be equal amounts of criticism/praise for both companies. Any other thoughts/criticisms are also welcomed, especially potential weaknesses for EMC.",9,8,1346431911.0,2012-08-31T16:51:51+00:00,t3_z55lg,investing

Excerpt: ""The reason is simple: a grossly disproportionate fraction of the total return came from a very few ""superstocks"" like Dell Computer, which increased in value over 550 times. If you didn’t have one of the half-dozen or so of these in your portfolio, then you badly lagged the market. (The odds of owing one of the 10 superstocks are approximately one in six.) Of course, by owning only 15 stocks you also increase your chances of becoming fabulously rich. But unfortunately, in investing, it is all too often true that the same things that maximize your chances of getting rich also maximize your chances of getting poor.""",0,8,1342642105.0,2012-07-18T20:08:25+00:00,t3_ws05z,investing
97,DELL,New to day trading,"Hello all,
Im new to day trading, many of my finance professors discouraged it,but I'm not very risk averse, so I decided to open an account. Hopefully I can add my own input to this subreddit.

I work in the IT world, and have been doing some trading at the same time @ work. Any advice, so far I have been doing a few shorts and longs based on earnings reports. I also look at their long term stock price, if it is close to their one year low I will buy it, since I only risk losing that much anyway ( i know I can lose it all at any moment, thus my no aversion to risk). But I also look at the companies 10k to look at their balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement.  One piece of advice tho, avoid Groupon, that was a big loser for me. Avoid high tech if anything, e.g. Dell, HPQ. If you guys have any questions let me know, but basically I'm new. And yes my username is the computer I'm using, yeup its my work computer, I needed a name I could not forget.

At first I thought about either taking profit or protecting my downside. But then I remembered why I bought AAPL in the first place.

I should have bought Apple when I bought 2 iPods, 2 iPhones &amp; a Macbook. I did buy Apple when I saw images on Reddit where all the laptops were Macbooks except for that one guy with a Dell.

If AAPL goes down, I will buy more (as long as they churn out products people love.) If AAPL goes up, I will happily collect the dividend along the way. 

So I am going to try to ignore something that is less than 5% of my portfolio, even if it accounts for a significant portion of my profits.

http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-08-16/dell-misses-sales-estimates-on-weaker-consumer-spending.html

Dell Inc. (DELL), the second-largest personal-computer maker, reported second-quarter sales that missed analysts’ estimates, hurt by a slump in desktop PC and consumer spending.

Sales rose less than 1 percent to $15.7 billion, Round Rock, Texas-based Dell said today in a statement. Analysts had estimated revenue of $15.8 billion, according to Bloomberg data.

Lackluster demand from consumers and market-share gains by Apple Inc. weighed on results, offsetting stronger spending on server computers. Among home-computer shoppers, tablets and smartphones may have sapped demand for PCs. Even if consumer spending comes back, Dell may struggle to win a big enough share of those orders, said Bill Kreher, an analyst at Edward Jones.

13,DELL,Nassim Taleb and the Black Swan. Challenging the academics foundations of economics and finance. Repost from /r/PhilosophyofScience.,"[Nassim Taleb](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb) is the best-selling author of [The Black Swan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Swan_\(Taleb_book\)). He is a former Wall Street trader and a current University Professor of risk engineering whose grandfather and great-grandfather were former deputy prime ministers of Lebanon.

Taleb describes himself as a skeptical empiricist. Philosophers of science would probably describe him as an extreme [scientific anti-realist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-realism). He attacks modern intellectuals for what he calls their platonicity - a tendency to create underlying pictures of reality that go well beyond the data. His gripe is primarily with the social sciences, historical studies, the media and every day thinking. He is particularly savage towards finance, attacking Nobel Prize winners such as [Robert C Merton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Merton) (including to his face) for devising and promoting economic models which assume that market price movements behave in a log-normal fashion. It is the widespread belief in these models which he believes are the cause of financial market crashes.

The problem is, he says, we inhabit two worlds of probability which are often confused. He labels these two worlds - mediocristan and extremistan. Mediocristan governs much of the human physical world - it can be described neatly by the [Gaussian (bell) curve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution) where no single observation can affect the properties of a large sample much - height, weight, IQ, mortality rates. Extremistan describes the more random nature of human constructions and some natural processes - wealth, book sales, inflation, deaths from terrorist incidents, population of cities, size of planets. Western intellectuals have tried to fit normal curves to Extremistan processes. 

His book is frequently punctuated by descriptions of common fallacies, some of which I list below.

*[Ludic fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludic_fallacy) : Trying to fit probability distributions to data without enough information and reasoning based on these false assumptions. Sometimes we have to reason without even knowing anything about the underlying distribution.*

*The problem of silent evidence: Deriving causality from an analysis of the winners e.g. assessing the traits (such as risk-tasking appetite) in common of millionaires to explain their success without examining the many more people with those same traits that failed to be millionaires.*

*[Narrative fallacy](http://www.financialsense.com/editorials/abdallah/2009/0209.html): Fitting a story or pattern to a series of facts such as what happens in historical explanation and ignoring the many counterfactuals.*

*[Confirmation bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias): Seeking confirmatory evidence to validate preconceptions and hypotheses.*

For a video lecture detailing his thoughts in The Black Swan, [see here](http://fora.tv/2008/02/04/Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb_A_Crazier_Future) (thanks to rjefferson). His (rather unconventional) website can be found [here](http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com). Long podcast interviews with Taleb about the financial crisis found [here](http://www.econtalk.org/archives/_featuring/nassim_taleb/). One of his great heroes is [Benoit Mandelbrot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benoît_Mandelbrot).

Taleb's influence has been substantial. He is credited with predicting the present financial crisis (and profitting from it substantially as a result). He recently [testified in Congress](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X7pNFbGjz0). He draws crowds that have Bill Gates and Michael Dell waiting in line. At times he is a pompous and haughty read - unquestionably controversial - but as of 2009, he is probably the most influential and widely read philosopher of science alive.

Nonostante, per il momento, nessuna anticipazione sia trapelata, le riunioni di queste settimane tra i tecnici dell'Agenzia, i rappresentanti del mondo professionale e gli esperti fiscali delle organizzazioni di artigiani, commercianti e PMI, tengono in piedi fondamentalmente due possibilità: una distribuzione proporzionale dei fondi oppure una liquidazione ""orizzontale"" per annualità che si tradurrebbe in un Click Day ""parziale"". Nella fattispecie, per le istanze di rimborso 2004 e 2005, che secondo il criterio adottato avrebbero la precedenza, le risorse dovrebbero essere sufficienti a soddisfare tutte le richieste, mentre si renderebbe necessaria la prenotazione telematica per gli anni successivi, il 2006 e il 2007.
