45,AAPL,"$AAPL Trade Plan:

Market Context: $AAPL closed at $275.61, showing strong momentum but currently overbought with an RSI of 84.05. The stock is trading above its 30-day moving average (MA30) of 261.11 and 50-day moving average (MA50) of 253.92, indicating bullish sentiment in the short term.

Directional Bias: Given the high RSI, there's a risk of a pullback. However, the stock remains near its 60-day high of 277.32, suggesting potential for a breakout if momentum continues. The 60-day low of 223.78 provides a reference for support.

Suggested Entry: Consider entering a long position if $AAPL breaks above $277.32 with volume confirmation. 

Stop: Place a stop-loss at $270.00 to manage risk.

Targets: Set the first target at $280.00 and a second target at $285.00, aligning with psychological levels and recent highs.
