1,DGXX,What are you doing with CoreWeave ( $CRWV ) stock on the post-earnings decline?,,
2,DGXX,"$DGXX DGXX’s ARMS 200 modular pods and the associated NeoCloudz GPU‑as‑a‑service platform are designed to monetize high‑performance compute in a fundamentally different way from the giga‑watt campuses being developed by its mining peers.  Below is an AI assisted assessment of the revenue opportunities and the strategic value of the modular, potentially patent‑protected architecture.

Revenue‑generation opportunities:

1)  1 MW ARMS 200 pods with 256 GPUs

         Each ARMS 200 module is self‑contained: it provides 1 MW of critical power, is equipped to host up to 256 NVIDIA B200/B300 GPUs and uses liquid cooling with dual‑path power redundancy .  Because the pods are Tier‑III certified and designed for rapid deployment , they can be brought online far faster than traditional data‑centres.  High‑density GPU pods can command premium rental rates because tenants pay for compute rather than just space and power.",2025-11-12T07:57:34Z,2025-11-12T07:57:34+00:00
